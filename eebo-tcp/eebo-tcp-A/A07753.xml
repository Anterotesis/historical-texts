            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Do not doubt, but many (who haue knowen my dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in times past) will wonder that (amongst so manie
excellent Musicions as be in this our contrie at this
time, and farre better furnished with learning then my
selfe,) I haue taken vpon mee to set out that in our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
tongue, which of all other things hath beene in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
least knowen to our contrimen, and most in practise.
Yet if they would consider the reasons mouing mee
therevnto: they would not onely leaue to marueile, but
also thinke mee worthie, if not of praise, yet of pardon for
my paines. First, the earnest intreatie of my friends
daily requesting, importuning, and as it were adiuring
me by the loue of my contrie, which next vnto the glorie of God, ought to be most deere to
euery man. Which reason so often tolde and repeted to mee by them, chiefely caused mee
yeld to their honest request in taking in hand this worke which now I publish to the viewe
of the worlde: Not so much seeking thereby any name or glorie, (though no honest minde
do contemne that also, and I might more largely by other meanes and lesse labour haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
as in some sort to further the studies of them, who (being indewed with good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
wittes, and well inclined to learne that diuine Art of Musick) are destitute of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
masters. Lastly, the solitarie life which I lead (being compelled to keepe at home)
caused mee be glad to finde any thing wherein to keepe my selfe exercised for the benefite
of my contrie. But as concerning the booke it selfe, if I had before I began it, imagined
halfe the paines and labour which it cost mee, I would sooner haue beene perswaded to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thing, then to haue taken in hand such a tedious peece of worke, like vnto a great Sea,
which the further I entred into, the more I sawe before mee vnpast: So that at length
dispairing euer to make an end (seeing that growe so bigg in mine hands, which I thought
to haue shut vp in two or three sheetes of paper,) I layde it aside, in full determination to
haue proceeded no further, but to haue left it off as shamefully as it was foolishly begonne.
But then being admonished by some of my friends, that it were pittie to lose the frutes of
the imployment of so manie good houres, and how iustly I should be condemned of ignorant
presumpsion, in taking that in hand which I could not performe, if I did not go forwarde:
I resolued to endure whatsoeuer paine, labour, losse of time and expence, and what not?
rather then to leaue that vnbrought to an end, in the which I was so farre ingulfed.
Taking therefore those precepts which being a childe I learned, and laying them togither
in order, I began to compare them with some other of the same kinde, set downe by some
late writers: But then was I in a worse case then before. For I found such diuersitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, that I knew not which part said truest, or whome I might best beleeue. Then
was I forced to runne to the workes of manie, both strangers and English men (whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
togithers with their names had beene buried with mee in perpetuall obliuion, if it
had not beene for this occasion) for a solution and clearing of my doubt. But to my great
griefe, then did I see the most part of mine owne precepts false and easie to be confuted by
the workes of <hi>Tauerner, Fairfax, Cooper,</hi> and infinite more, whose names it would be
too tedious to set downe in this place. But what labour it was to tomble, tosse, &amp; search so
manie bookes, &amp; with what toyle &amp; wearinesse I was enforced to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare the parts for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the valure of some notes, (spending whole daies, yea &amp; manie times weekes for the
demonstration of one example, which one would haue thought might in a moment haue
been set down,) I leaue to thy discretion to consider: and none can fully vnderstande, but
he who hath had or shall haue occasion to do the like. As for the methode of the booke,
<pb facs="tcp:12119:4"/>
although it be not such as may in euery point satisfie the curiositie of <hi>Dichotomistes:</hi> yet
is it such as I thought most conuenient for the capacitie of the learner. And I haue had
an especiall care, that nothing should be set out of his owne place, but that it which should
serue to the vnderstanding of that which followeth should be set first. And as for the
definition, diuision, partes, &amp; kindes of Musicke, I haue omitted them as things onely ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to content the learned, and not for the instruction of the ignorant. Thus hast thou
the reasons which moued mee to take in hand &amp; go forward with the booke. The paines
of making whereof, though they haue beene peculier to mee, &amp; onely to mee: yet will the
profit redound to a great number. And this much I may boldly affirme, that any of but
meane capacitie, so they can but truely sing their tunings, which we commonly call the sixe
notes, or <hi>vt, re, mi, fa, sol, la,</hi> may without any other help sauing this booke, perfectly learn
to sing, make discant, and set partes well and formally togither. But seeing in these latter
daies &amp; doting age of the worlde, there is nothing more subiect to calumnie &amp; backbiting
then that which is most true &amp; right: and that as there be many who will enter into the
reading of my booke for their instruction: so I doubt not but diuerse also will read it, not
so much for anie pleasure or profit they looke for in it, as to finde some thing whereat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
or take occasion of backbyting. Such men I warne, that if in friendship they will (ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publikly or priuately) make me acquainted with any thing in the booke, which either
they like not or vnderstand not: I will not onely be content to giue them a reason (and if
I cannot, to turne to their opinion,) but also thinke my selfe highly beholding to them.
But if any man, either vpon mallice, or for ostentation of his owne knowledge, or for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(as who is more bolde then blinde bayerd) do either in huggermugger or openly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
that which either he vnderstandeth not, or then maliciously wresteth to his own
sense, he (as <hi>Augustus</hi> said by one, who had spoken euill of him) shall finde that I haue a
tongue also: and that <hi>me remorsurum petit,</hi> He snarleth at one who will bite againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I haue saide nothing without reason, or at least confirmed by the authorities of the
best, both schollers &amp; practicioners. There haue also been some, who (knowing their own
insufficiencie, and not daring to disallow, nor being able to improue any thing in the booke)
haue neuerthelesse gone about to discredite both mee and it another waie, affirming that
I haue by setting out thereof maliciously gone about to take awaye the liuings from a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of honest poore men, who liue (and that honestly) vpon teaching not halfe of that which
in this booke may be found. But to answere those malicious caterpillers, who liue vpon the
paines of other men,) this booke will be so farre from the hinderance of anie, that by the
contrarie, it will cause those whome they alledge to be thereby damnified, to be more able
to giue reason for that which they do: Whereas before they either did it at hap-hazerd, or
for all reasons alledged, that they were so taught. So that if any at all owe mee any thanks
for the great paines which I haue taken, they be in my iudgement, those who taught that
which they knew not, and may here if they will learne. But if the effect do not answere to
my good meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if manie do not reape that benefit which I hoped; yet there wil be
no reason why I should be blamed, who haue done what I could, and giuen an occasion to
others of better iudgement and deeper skill then my selfe to doe the like. And as for
those ignorant Asses, who take vpon them to lead others, none being more blinde then
themselues, and yet without any reason, before they haue seene their workes, wil condemne
other men, I ouerpasse them, as being vnworthie to be nominated, or that any man should
vouchsafe to aunswere them: for they be in deede such as doing wickedly hate the light
for feare they should be espyed. And so (gentle Reader) hoping by thy fauourable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
to auoide both the malice of the enuious &amp; the temeritie of the ignorant, wishing
thee the whole profit of the booke and all perfection in thy studies, I rest.</p>

               <p>But before you goe, I praie you repeat
some of the discourses which you had yester night
at master <hi>Sophobulus</hi> his banket: For commonly

               <p>It is true in deede. And yester night, there
were a number of excellent schollers, (both gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and others:) but all the propose which then
was discoursed vpon, was Musicke.</p>

               <p>I trust you were contented to suffer others

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>I would that had been the worst: for I was compelled to discouer mine own

               <p>Among the rest of the guestes, by chaunce, master <hi>Aphron</hi> came thether
also, who falling to discourse of Musicke, was in an argument so quickely taken vp &amp;
hotly pursued by <hi>Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Calergus,</hi> two kinsmen of <hi>Sophobulus,</hi> as in his owne
art he was ouerthrowne. But he still sticking in his opinion, the two gentlemen
requested mee to examine his reasons, and confute them. But I refusing &amp; preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ignorance, the whole companie condemned mee of discurtesie, being fully
perswaded, that I had beene as skilfull in that art, as they tooke mee to be learned in
others. But supper being ended, and Musicke bookes, according to the custome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to the table: the mistresse of the house presented mee with a part, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
requesting mee to sing. But when after manie excuses, I protested vnfainedly
that I could not: euerie one began to wonder. Yea, some whispered to others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
how I was brought vp: so that vpon shame of mine ignorance I go nowe
to seeke out mine olde frinde master <hi>Gnorimus,</hi> to make my selfe his scholler.</p>

               <p>I am glad you are at length come to bee of that minde, though I wished it
sooner: Therefore goe, and I praie God send you such good successe as you would

I thinke, about one time wee may both meete at our lodging.</p>

But if I be not deceiued, I see him whome I seeke sitting at yonder doore, out of

               <p>And you also, good master <hi>Philomathes,</hi> I am glad to see you, seing it is
so long agoe since I sawe you, that I thought you had either been dead, or then had

addicted.</p>

               <p>My errand is to you, to make my self your scholler. And seeing I haue found

               <p>The <hi>Herralds</hi> shall answere that for mee: for if you should aske them, why
two men of one name should not both giue one Armes? they will straight answere
you, that they be of seuerall houses, and therefore must giue diuers coates. So these
two <hi>bb,</hi> though they be both comprehended vnder one name, yet they are in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

which is commonly vsed in the <hi>Treble</hi> or highest part, and is made thus 𝄞. And
the ♭ cliefe which is comon to euery part, is made thus ♭ or thus ♮ the one signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

selfe: For Musicke is included in no certaine bounds, (though the Musicions do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
their songs within a certaine compasse.) And as you <hi>Philosophers</hi> say, that no
number can be giuen so great, but that you may giue a greater. And no poynt so
small, but that you may giue a smaller. So there can be no note giuen so high, but
you may giue a higher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none so lowe, but that you may giue a lower. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call to minde that which I tolde you concerning the keyes and their eightes: for
if Mathematically you consider it, it is true as well without the compasse of the
Scale, as within: and so may be continued infinitely.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>Because that compasse was the reach of most voyces:<note place="margin">What is to bee sung vnder Gam vt.</note> so that vnder <hi>Gam vt</hi>
the voice seemed as a kinde of <hi>humming,</hi> and aboue <hi>E la</hi> a kinde of constrained skric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.

               <p>Then I perceiue the first note standeth in <hi>F fa vt</hi> vnder <hi>Gam vt,</hi> and being the

because they be in their eyghtes I may sing them there also. But I pray you why do you
set a ♭ in <hi>E la mi?</hi> seeing there is neither in it nor in <hi>E la mi</hi> in alte, nor in <hi>E la</hi> any <hi>fa,</hi> and
the ♭ cliefe is onely set to those keyes wherein there is <hi>fa.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Because there is no note of it selfe either flatt or sharpe,<note place="margin">Euery note both sharpe and flat.</note> but compared with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
is sometime flatt and sometime sharpe: so that there is no note in the whole Scale

also (altering the tune alitle) sing <hi>fa</hi> in <hi>E la mi.</hi> There be manie other flattes in Musicke,
as the ♭ in <hi>A la mi re,</hi> whereof I will not speake at this time, because I will not cloy your

a song of many parts haue this Moode of the imperfect of the lesse prolation, set in one
parte with a stroke through it, and in another part without the stroke, than is that parte
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12119:16"/>
which hath the signe with the stroke so diminished, as one <hi>briefe</hi> standeth for a <hi>semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briefe</hi>
of the other part which hath the figne without the strok, whereof you shal see an

                  </expan> then is the song so noted, so diminished in his notes, as foure <hi>semibriefes</hi> are
song but for one, which you shall more cleerely perceiue heereafter, when we come to

The example whereof you had in your Tenor part of the song set next after the former
Moodes. But the examples of perfection and imperfection, are so common, specially in
the Moodes of perfect time and more prolation, that it would be superfluous to set them
downe. There is also another obseruation a kin to this, to be obserued likewise in Moods
perfect, and is termed alteration.</p>

               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>It is that which taketh halfe the value of euery note and rest from it,<note place="margin">Dupla.</note> so that two
notes of one kinde doe but answere to the value of one: and it is knowen when the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
number contayneth the lower twise thus. 2<hi rend="sub">1</hi> 4<hi rend="sub">2</hi> 6<hi rend="sub">3</hi> 8<hi rend="sub">4</hi> 12<hi rend="sub">6</hi> &amp;c. But by the way you must
note that time out of minde we haue tearmed that dupla where we set two Minymes
to the Semibriefe, which if it were trew, there should be few songs but you should haue
dupla quadrupla and octupla in it, and then by consequent must cease to be dupla. But if
they thinke that not inconuenient,<note place="margin">A confutation of Dupla in the minyme.</note> I pray them how will they answere that which from
time to time hath been set downe for a general rule amongst all musitions, that <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the greater inequalitie, do alwaies signifie dimunution,</hi> and if their <hi>minyms</hi> be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished,
I pray you how shall two of them make vp the time of a full stroke, for <hi>in all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12119:18"/>
proportions the vpper number signifieth the semibriefe, and the lower number the stroke,</hi> so
that as the vpper number is to the lower, so is the <hi>semibriefe</hi> to the stroke. Thus if a man
would goe seeke to refute their <hi>Inueterat</hi> opinions, it were much labour spent in vayne:
but this one thing I will adde, that they haue not their opinion confirmed by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of any, either musition or writer, where as on the other side, all who haue beene
of any name in Musicke, haue vsed the other dupla, and set it downe in their works, as
you may see in the example following, confirmed by the authorities of <hi>Peter Aron,
Franchinus, Iordanus,</hi> and nowe of late dayes, learned <hi>Glareanus, Losius, Listeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Berhusius</hi> and a greate number more, all whome it were to tedius to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
true it is that I was taught the contrary my selfe, and haue seene many old written
books to the same ende. But yet haue I not seene any published vnder any mans name:
but if their opinion had been true, I maruayle that non amongst so many good musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
haue eyther gone about to proue the goodnesse of their owne waie, or refute the
opinions of others from time to time by general consent and approbation, taking new
strength: therefore let no man cauil at my doing in that I haue chaunged my opinion
and set downe the proportions otherwise then I was taught them, For I assure them
that if any man will giue mee stronger reason to the coutrary, than those which I haue
brought for my defence, I will not onely chaunge this opinion, but acknowledge my
selfe debt bound to him, as he that hath brought me out of an error to the way of trueth.</p>

goe from his opinion, as it was for <hi>Aristotle</hi> to disalow the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> with this

treatise as they are commonly prickt now, to let you see that in the matter there is no
difference betwixt vs, except onely in forme of pricking, which they doe in great notes
and we in small: and to the ende, that if any man like his owne way better than this, hee
may vse his owne discretion: But we goe too farre, and therefore peruse your example.</p>

               <p>Quadrupla is a proportion deminishing the value of the notes to the quarter
of that which they were before, &amp; it is perceiued in singing, when a number is set before
the song, comprehending another foure times, as 4<hi rend="sub">1</hi> 8<hi rend="sub">2</hi> 12<hi rend="sub">4</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Quintupla and Sextupla I haue not seene vsed by any stranger in their songs (so far as
I remember) but heere we vse them, but not as they vse their other proportions, for wee
call that sextupla, where wee make sixe black <hi>minyms</hi> to the <hi>semibriefe,</hi> and quintupla
when we haue but fiue &amp;c. But that is more by custome then reason.</p>

As for the vse of this Table, when you would know what proportion any one number
hath to another, finde out the two numbers in the Table, then looke vpwarde to
the triangle inclosing those numbers, and in the angle of concourse, that is, where
your two lynes meete togither, there is the proportion of your two numbers written:
as for example, let your two numbers be 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Looke vpward, and in the top of the
tryangle couering the two lynes which inclose those numbers, you find written <hi>sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertia,</hi>
so likewise 24. and 42. you finde in the Angle of concurse written <hi>super triparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
quartas,</hi> and so of others.</p>

brayns about. As for musick, the principal thing we seek in it, is to delight the eare, which
cannot so perfectly be done in these hard proportions, as otherwise, therefore proceede
to the rest of your musicke, specially to the example of those Proportions which you
promised before.</p>

               <p>True, but he was moued so to doe by the wordes of his text, which reason also
mouid <hi>Alexandro Striggio</hi> to make this other, wherein you haue one poynt handled
first in the ordinary Moode through all the parts, then in Tripla through all the parts,
and lastly in proportions, no part like vnto another, for the Treble contayneth <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in the <hi>quadrupla</hi> proportion. The second Treble or sextus hath Tripla prickt all in
blacke notes: your Altus or Meane contayneth <hi>diminution</hi> in Dupla proportion. The
Tenor goeth through with his Tripla (which was begonne before) to the ende. The
<hi>Quintus</hi> is <hi>sesquialtra</hi> to the <hi>breefe</hi> which hath this signe 𝇍 3<hi rend="sub">2</hi> set before it: But if the
signe were away, then would three <hi>minyms</hi> make a whole stroke, where as nowe three
<hi>semibriefs</hi> make but one stroke The Base is the ordinary Moode, wherein is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as you may see.</p>

And to the end that you may see how euerie thing hangeth vpon another, and howe
the proportions follow others, I will shew you particularlie euerie one. The first cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
which commeth after the proportion of equalitie, is commonlie called <hi>sextupla,</hi> or six
to one, signified by the more prolation, retorted thus
But if we consider rightlie that which we call <hi>sextupla,</hi> 
               <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> is but true
tripla, prickt in blacke notes. But because I made it to expresse
<hi>sextupla,</hi> I haue set it downe in semibriefes, allowing sixe for a
stroke, and taking awaie the retortiue mood, The next proportion
is true <hi>Dupla:</hi> signified by the time vnperfect of the lesse prolation, retorted thus.
which manner of marking <hi>Dupla</hi> cannot be disallowed: but if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> next before had beene signified by anie mood, then might not
this <hi>Dupla</hi> haue beene signified by the retort, but by proportionate
numbers. Thirdlie commeth the lesse prolation in the meane part, &amp;
that ordinarie <hi>Tripla</hi> of the blacke minimes to a stroke in the base: and
because those three blacke minimes, be sung in the time of two white minimes, they
were marked thus 𝇊32. signifieng three minimes to two minimes. But if the signe of
the prolation had been left out, &amp; all been prickt in white notes, then had it been true
thus <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> And in this maner most commonlie do the <hi>Italians</hi> signifie
their three minimes to a stroke or tripla of three minimes,
which is indeed true <hi>Sesquialtra.</hi> But because wee woulde
here expresse true tripla, I haue set it downe thus,
<gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> Therefore to destroy the proportion follow these proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
numbers at the signe of degree thus 𝇋1<hi rend="sub">3</hi> which maketh
the common time vnpetfect of the lesse prolation.</p>
            <p>Then followeth true <hi>tripla,</hi> which they call <hi>tripla</hi> to the Semibriefe. But because it is
afterwardes broken, I thought it better to pricke it white then blacke: but the matter is
come so farre nowadaies, that some wil haue all semibrieues in proportion prickt black
else (say they) the proportion will not be knowne. But that is false, as being grounded
neither vpon reason nor authoritie. The <hi>tripla</hi> broken in the more prolation, maketh
nine minimes for one stroke, which is our common <hi>Nonapla,</hi> but in one place of the
broken tripla, where a semibriefe and a minime come successiuelie that they marked
with these numbers 92, which is the sigue of <hi>Quadrupla sesquialtra,</hi> if the numbers were
perpendicularly placed: but if that were true, why should not the rest also which were
before be so noted, seeing nine of them were sung to two minymes of the Treble.
Then followeth true <hi>Dupla:</hi> but for the reason before saide, I signifyed it with numbers
and not by the retort but in the Basse, because the signe of the lesse prolation went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before, I could not with reason alter it, and therefore I suffered the retort to
stand still, because I thought it as good as the <hi>proportionat</hi> numbers in that place. Then
againe followeth true <hi>Tripla</hi> in the more prolation, afterward the contrarie numbers
1<hi rend="sub">3</hi> of <hi>Sub Tripla</hi> destroying the proportion the more prolation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap>
to which the Basse singeth <hi>Quintupla</hi> being prickt thus
such was our maner of pricking without any reason or almost
common sence, to make fiue crotchets be <hi>Quintupla</hi> to a Semibriefe, seeing foure of
them are but the propper value of one Semibreefe. But if they wonld make fiue crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets
to one femibreefe, then must they set downe <hi>Sequiquarta</hi> proportion thus 1<hi rend="sub">4</hi>,
wherein fiue semibriefes or their value make vp the time of foure semibriefes or strokes.
But I am almost out of my purpose, and to returne to our matter, I haue altered those
crotchets into semibriefes expressing true <hi>Quintupla.</hi> Then commeth <hi>Quintupla</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
which is our common <hi>Decupla,</hi> But if the other were <hi>Quintupla,</hi> then is this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12119:31"/>
               <hi>Quintupla,</hi> because there goeth but the value of fiue semibriefes for a stroke, and
I thinke none of vs but would tsiinke a man out of his wits, who would confesse, that
two testers make a shilling, and denie that sixe peeces of two pence a peece, or tvvelue
single pence do likewise make a shilling. Yet we will confesse that fiue semibriefes to
one is <hi>Quintupla.</hi> But we will not confesse that ten minimes, being the value of fiue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mibriefes,
compared to one semibriefe, is likewise <hi>Quintupla:</hi> and so in <hi>Quadrupla, sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tupla,
septupla,</hi> and others. Then commeth the common measure, or the lesse prolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(the signe of <hi>Subquintupla</hi> thus 1<hi rend="sub">5</hi>. destroying the proportion) for which the base sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<hi>septupla,</hi> but as it is set downe in the first waie, it is as it were not <hi>septupla,</hi> but <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partripartiens,
Quartas,</hi> or 7<hi rend="sub">4</hi>. Therefore I set them all downe in semibriefes, allowing
seuen of them to a stroke: which ended commeth equalitie after which followeth true
<hi>Dupla</hi> in the more prolation, which we sometime call <hi>Sextupla,</hi> and sometime <hi>Tripla.</hi>
After which and last of all commeth equalitie.</p>

               <p>Then in playne tearmes, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied

of the fayre morning: I am come to this place to
snatch a mouthful of this holsome ayre: which gently breathing vpon these sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
flowers, and making a whispering noyse amongst these tender leaues, delighteth
with refreshing, and refresheth with delight my ouer-wearied sences. But tel me I pray
you the cause of your hither comming; haue you not forgotten some part of that which
I shewed you at our last being togither?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>No verily, but by the contrary, I am become such a singer as you would wonder

               <p>Be silent and I will shew you. I haue a Brother a great scholler, and a reasonable
musition for singing: he, at my first comming to you conceiued an opinion (I know not
vpon what reason grounded,) that I should neuer come to any meane knowledge in
musicke; and therefore, when he heard me practise alone, he would continually mock
me; indeede not without reason, for many times I would sing halfe a note too high,
other while as much too lowe; so that he could not conteyne himselfe from laughing:
yet now and then he would set me right, more to let mee see that he could doe it, then
that he ment any way to instruct me: which caused me so diligently to apply my prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>song
booke; that in a manner, I did no other thing but sing practising, to skip from one
key to another, from flat to sharp, from sharp to flat, from any one place in the Scale
to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>other, so that there was no song so hard, but I would venture vpon it, no Mood nor
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12119:39"/>
Proportion so strange, but I would goe through and sing perfectly before I left it: and
in the ende I came to such perfection, that I might haue been my brothers maister: for
although he had a little more practise to sing at first sight then I had: yet for the Moods
Ligatures, and other such things I might set him to schoole.</p>

               <p>Beeing this last daye vpon occasion of some businesse at one of my friends hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
we had some songs sung: Afterwards falling to discourse of musicke and musitions,
one of the company naming a friend of his owne, tearmed him the best Descanter that
was to bee found. Now sir, I am at this time come to know what Descant is, and to
learne the same.</p>

               <p>In deed when I came to you first, I was of that minde: but the common Prouerb

I doe not meane to goe backe till I haue gone quite through al, therefore I pray
you now, (seeing the time and place fitteth so well) to discourse to me what Descant is,
what parts, and how many it hath, and the rest.</p>

               <p>The heate increaseth, and that which you demand requireth longer discourse
then you looke for.<note place="margin">Exposition of the name of Descant.</note> Let vs therefore goe and sit in yonder shadie Arbor to auoyde the
vehementnesse of the Sunne. The name of Descant is vsurped of the musitions in diuers
significations: some time they take it for the whole harmony of many voyces: others
sometime for one of the voyces or partes: &amp; that is, when the whole song is not passing
three voyces. Last of all, they take it for singing a part extempore vpon a playnesong, in
which sence we commonly vse it: so that when a man talketh of a Descanter, it must be
vnderstood of one that can extempore sing a part vpon a playne song.</p>

that is, when to a note of the plainsong, there goeth but one note of descant. Therfore
when you would sing vpon a plainsong, looke where the first note of it stands, and then
<hi>sing another for it which may bee distant from it, three, fiue, or eight notes,</hi> and so foorth
with others, but <hi>with a sixt we sildome begin or end.</hi>

reason whereof you shall know hereafter, when you haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
what a <hi>Canon</hi> is. In the meane time let vs goe forvvarde

for no close may be flat, but if you had made your waie thus, it hadde beene much

without a discord, but the lesse offence you giue in the discord the better it is, and the
shorter while you staie vpon the discord, the lesse offence you giue. Therefore, if you
had set a pricke after the Minime, and made your two Crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets,

Your next note had the same fault, for that you staied a vvhole
Minime in the fourth, which you see I haue mended: making
the last minim of your third note a crotchet, and setting a prick
after the first. Your fift, sixt, and seuenth notes be wilde and vnformall, for that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formall

if you your selfe should examine it, you would finde matter enough without a Tutor, to
condemne it: as for the first, there are foure notes that might be easilie amended with a
pricke, altering some of their length, by the obseruation which I gaue you before. But
as for the place which you haue alreadie censured, if all the maisters and schollers in the

the harmonie seemeth bare) and the odde rest giueth an vnspeakable grace to the point

for the latter halfe of your

the second and third time before you leaue it. But now seeing you knowe the rules of
singing one part aboue or vnder the plainsong: it followeth, to shew you how to make
more partes. But before we come to that, I must shew you those thinges which of olde

but to content wranglers, who I know will at euerie little ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
take occasion to backbire, and detract from that which
they cannot disproue. I know they will excuse themselues with that new inuention of
<hi>Tripla</hi> to the semibriefe, and tripla to the minime, and that that kinde of <hi>tripla</hi> which is
<hi>tripla</hi> to the minime, must be prickt in minimes, and the other in semibriefes. But in
that inuention they ouershoote themselues, seeing it is grounded vpon custome, &amp; not
vpon reason. They wil replie and saie, the <hi>Italians</hi> haue vsed it: that I graunt, but not in
that order as we doe: For when they marke tripla of three minimes for a stroke, they
doe most vsuallie set these numbers before it 5<hi rend="sub">2</hi>: which is the true marking of <hi>Sesqui al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera,</hi>
and these three minimes are true <hi>sesqui altra</hi> it selfe. But you shall neuer find in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of their workes a minime set downe for the time of a blacke semibriefe and a Crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet,
or three blacke minimes, which all our Composers both for voices and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
doe most commonlie vse. It is true that <hi>Zaccone</hi> in the second book &amp; 38. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of practise of musicke, doth allow a minime for a stroke in the more prolation, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12119:49"/>
prooueth it out of <hi>Palestina,</hi> but that is not when the song is marked with proportionate
numbers: but when all the partes haue the lesse prolation, and one onelie part hath the
more,<note place="margin">In the first part</note> in which case the part so marked, containeth <hi>Augmentation</hi> as I saide before:
and so is euerie minime of the more prolation worth a semibriefe of the lesse. But let
euerie one vse his discretion, it is enough for me to let you see that I haue saide nothing
without reason, and that it hath beene no small tolle for me to seeke out the authorities

               <p>It is no hard matter, for you are not tied when your base singeth a semibriefe or
anie other note to sing one of the same length, but you may breake your notes at your
pleasure and sing what you list, so it be in true cordes to the other two partes: but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
fiftes and thirds intermingled with sixes, which of all other bee the sweetest and
most fit for three partes. For in foure or fiue parts you must haue more scope, because
there be more partes to be supplied. And therefore the eight must of force be the ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

               <p>Yes there is shift enough: but whie did you stand still with your last note also?

                  </gap>
and confer with my last going before) whereby you may learne to haue some meaning
in your parts to make them answer in Fuge. For if you examine wel mine other going
before, you shall see how the beginning of the treble leadeth the base, and howe in the
third note the base leadeth the treble in the fourth note, and how the beginning of the
ninth note of the base, leadeth the treble in the same note and next following.</p>

               <p>I perceiue all that, and now will I examine this which you haue set downe. In
your treble you followe the Fuge of the plainsong. But I praie you what reason moued
you to take a discord for the first part of your fourth note (which is the seconde of the
treble) and then to take a sharpe for the latter halfe, your note being flat.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>As for the discord it is taken in binding manner,<note place="margin">In what maner a sharpe, for a flat is alowable in the fift.</note> and as for the sharpe in the base
for the flat in the treble, the base being a <hi>Cadence,</hi> the nature thereof requireth a sharp,
and yet let your eares (or whose soeuer else) be iudge, sing it and you wil like the sharpe
much better then the flat in my opinion. Yet this youe must marke by the waie, that
though this be good in halfe a note as here you see, yet is it intollerable in whole semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briefes.</p>

               <p>This obseruation is necessarie to be knowne, but as for the rest of your lesson, I

well as to the base. Next, your standing in one place two vvhole semibriefes together,
that is, in the latter ende of the thirde note, all the fourth, and halfe of the fift. Thirdly,
your causing the treble strike a sharpe eight to the base, which is a fault muche offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

from <hi>F fa vt</hi> to <hi>B fa b mi,</hi> in the eight note, in which fault, you haue beene nowe thrise
taken. Lastly, your old fault, standing so long before the close: all these be grosse falts:
but here is your owne waie altered in those places which I told you did mislike me, and
which you your selfe might haue made much better, if you had beene attentiue to your
matter in hand. But such is the nature of you schollers, that so you do much, you care
not how it bee done, though it be better to make one point well, then twentie naughty

worth the hearing. But the French men and <hi>Italians,</hi> haue vsed a waie that thogh there
were foure or fiue partes in one, yet might it be perceiued and sung at the first, and the
maner thereof is this. Of how manie parts the <hi>Canon</hi> is, so manie Cliefes do they set
at the beginning of the verse, stil causing that which standeth neerest vnto the musick,
serue for the leading part, the next towards the left hand, for the next following parte,
and so consequentlie to the last. But if betvveene anie tvvo Cliefes you finde rests, those
belong to that part, which the cliefe standing next vnto them on the left side signifieth.</p>

            <p>Here be two parts in one in the <hi>Diapason cum diatessaron,</hi> or as we tearme it, in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
aboue, where you see first a <hi>C sol fa ut</hi> Cliefe standing on the lovvest rule, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it three minime rests. Then standeth the <hi>F fa ut</hi> cliffe on the fourth rule from below,
and because that standeth neerest to the notes, the base (which that cliffe representeth)
must begin, resting a minime rest after the plainsong, and the treble three minim restes.
And least you should misse in reckoning your pauses or rests, the note whereupon the
following part must begin, is marked with this signe?. It is true that one of those tvvo,
the signe or the rests is superfluous, but the order of setting more cliffes then one to one
verse, being but of late deuised, was not vsed when the signe was most common, but in
stead of them, ouer or vnder the song was written, in what distance the following parte
was from the leading, and most commonlie in this maner. <hi>Canon</hi> in * or * <hi>Superiore,</hi> or
<hi>inferiore.</hi> But to shun the labour of vvriting those words, the cliffes and rests haue byn
deuised, shewing the same thinge. And to the intent you may the better conceiue it,
here is another example wherin the treble beginneth, and the meane followeth within

the easinesse and commoditie which it hath, because it is better then to pricke so as to
make one sit fiue or sixe houres beating his braines, to finde out the following part. But
such hath beene our manner in manie other thinges heretofore, to doe things blindlie,
and to trouble the wittes of practisioners: whereas by the contrarie, straungers haue

There is also a manner of composition vsed amongst the <hi>Italians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Double desca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> which they call <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapunto
doppio,</hi> or double descant, and though it be no Canon, yet is it verie neere the
nature of a Canon: and therefore I thought it meetest to be handled in this place, and
it is no other thing, but a certaine kind of composition, which beeing sung after diuers
sortes,<note place="margin">Diuision of double desca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> by changing the partes, maketh diuers manners of harmonie: and is founde to
be of two sortes. The first is, when the principall (that is the thing as it is firste made)
and the replie (that is it which the principall hauing the partes changed dooth make)
are sung, changing the partes in such maner, as the highest part may be made the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and the lowest parte the highest, without anie change of motion: that is, if they
went vpward at the first, they goe also vpward when they are changed: and if they went
downeward at the first, they goe likewise downward being changed. And this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of two sortes: for if they haue the same motions being changed, they either keepe
the same names of the notes which were before, or alter them: if they keepe the same
names, the replie singeth the high part of the principall a fift lower, and the lower part
an eight higher: and if it alter the names of the notes, the higher part of the principal is
sung in the replie a tenth lower, and the lovver part an eight higher.</p>
            <p>The second kinde of double descant, is when the partes changed, the higher in the
lower, go by contrarie motions: that is, if they both ascende before, beeing chaunged
they descend:<note place="margin">Rules to be ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serued in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>positions of the first sort of the first kinde of double des<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cant.</note> or if they descend before, they ascend being changed. Therefore, when
we compose in the first maner, which keepeth the same motions and the same names,
we may not put in the principall a sixt, because in the replie it will make a discord: nor
may we put the partes of the song so farre asunder, as to passe a twelfe. Nor may we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
cause the higher part come vnder the lower, nor the lovver aboue the higher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
both those notes which passe the tvvelfth, and also those which make the lovver
part come aboue the higher in the replie, will make discords. Wee may not also put in
the principall a <hi>Cadence,</hi> wherein the seuenth is taken, because that in the replie it will
not doe wel. We may verie well vse the <hi>Cadence</hi> wherein the second or fourth is taken,
because in the replie they will cause verie good effectes. Wee must not also put in the
principall a flat tenth, after which followeth an eight, or a tvvelfe (a flatte tenth is when
the highest note of the tenth is flat, as from <hi>D sol re,</hi> to <hi>F fa ut</hi> in alte flatte, or from <hi>Gam
ut,</hi> to <hi>B fa b mi</hi> flat) nor a flat third before an vnison, or a fift when the parts go by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
motions: because if they be so put in the principall, there will follow <hi>Tritonus</hi> or
false fourth in the replie. Note also, that euerie tvvelfe in the principal, wil be in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
an vnison. And euery fift an eight, and al these rules must be exactlie kept in the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipal,
else wil not the replie be without faults. Note also, that if you wil close with a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
you must of necessitie end either your principal or replie, in the fift or twelf, which
also happeneth in the <hi>Cadences,</hi> in what place soeuer of the song they be, and betvveene
the parts wil be heard the relation of a <hi>Tritouns</hi> or false fourth, but that will bee a small
matter, if the rest of the composition be dulie ordered, as you may perceiue in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

And this is called double descant in the twelfe: but if we would compose in the second

be great or sharpe, and the other small or flat: nor may vve put <hi>Cadences</hi> without a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
The sixt likewise in this kinde may be vsed if (as I said before) you put not twoe of
them togither also if you list, the partes may one goe thorough another that is, the
lower may goe aboue the higher, and the higher vnder the lower, but with this caueat,
that when they be so mingled, you make them no further distant then a third, because
that when they remaine in their owne boundes, they may be distant a twelfth one from
another. Indeed we might goe further asunder, but though we did make them so farre
distant, yet might we not in anie case put a thirteenth, for it will bee false in the replie:
therefore it is best not to passe the twelfth, and to keepe the rules which I haue giuen, &amp;
likewise to cause the musicke (so farre as possiblie we may) proceed by degrees, &amp; shun
that motion of leaping (because that leaping of the fourth and the fift, may in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Also these compositions might be sung of three voices if you sing a part a tenth aboue
the lowe part of the principall, and in the reply a seuenth vnder the high part. It is true
that the descant will not be so pure as it ought to be, &amp; though it will be true from false
descant, yet will there bee vnisons &amp; other allowances which in other musicke woulde
scarce be sufferable. But because it is somwhat hard to compose in this kind, &amp; to haue
it come well in the replye, I will set you downe the principall rules how to do it leauing
the lesse necessarie obseruations to your own studie.<note place="margin">Rules for sing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing a third part to other two in double discant.</note> You must not then in any case put
a third or a tenth after an eighth when the parts of the song descend togither: &amp; when
the parts ascend you must not put a sixt after a fifth, nor a tenth after a twelfth, especially
when the high part doth not proceed by degrees, which motion is a little more tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then that which is made by leaping. Likewise you must not goe from an eight to a
flat tenth, except when the high part moueth by a whole note, and the lower part by a
halfe note (nor yet from a third or fifth to a flat tenth by contrary motions. Also you shal
not make the treble part go from fifth to a sharpe third the basse standing still, nor the
basse to go from a fifth to a flat third, or from a twelfth to a flat tenth the treble standing
stil, bicause the replie wil therby go against the rule. In this kind of discant euery tenth of
the principal wil be in the replie an eight, &amp; euery third of the principal in the replie wil
be a fifteenth: but the composer must make both the principall &amp; the replie together &amp;

And that you may the more cleerelie perceiue the great varietie of this kinde, if you
ioine to the low part of the principall, or of the thirde replie a high part distant from it
a tenth, or third: Or if you make the lowe part higher by an eight, and put to a part lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
then the high part by a tenth (because it will come better) euerie one of those waies
may by themselues be sung of three voices, as you saw before in the example of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
waie of the first kind of double descant. There be also (besides these which I haue
showen you) manie other waies of double descant, which it vvere too long and tedious
to set downe in this place, and you your selfe may hereafter by your owne studie finde
out. Therefore I will onlie let you see one waie <hi>Par arsin &amp; thesin,</hi> and so an ende of
double descant. If therefore you make a Canon <hi>per arsin &amp; thesin,</hi> without anie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde

            <p>Thus you see that these waies of double descant carie some difficultie, and that the
hardest of them all is the Canon. But if the Canon were made in that manner vppon a
plainsong (I meane a plainesong not made of purpose for the descant, but a common
plainsong or hymne, such as heretofore haue been vsed in churches) it would be much
harder to do. But because these waies seeme rather for curiositie then for your present
instruction, I vvould counsaile you to leaue to practise them, till you be perfect in your
descant, and in those plaine waies of Canon which I haue set dovvne, which will (as it
vvere) lead you by the hand to a further knowledge: and when you can at the first sight
sing two partes in one in those kindes vppon a plainesong, then may you practise other
hard vvaies, and speciallie those <hi>per arsin &amp; thesin,</hi> which of all other Canons carie
both most difficultie, and most maiestie: so that I thinke, that who so canne vpon anie
plainsong whatsoeuer, make such another waie as that of M. <hi>Bird,</hi> which I shevved you
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12119:62"/>
before, may with great reason be termed a great maister in musicke. But whosoeuer can
sing such a one at the first sight, vpon a ground, may boldie vndertake to make any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
which in musicke may be made. And for your further incouragement this much
I may boldlie affirme, that whosoeuer will exercise himselfe diligentlie in that kinde,
may in short time become an excellent Musician, because that he vvho in it is perfect,
may almost at the first sight see what may be done vpon anie plainsong.</p>
            <p>And these few vvaies vvhich you haue alreadie seene, shall be sufficient at this time for
your perfect instruction in tvvo parts in one vpon a plainsong. For if a manne shoulde
thinke to set dovvne euerie waie, and doe nothing all his life time but dailie inuent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie,
he should lose his labour, for anie other might come after him, and inuent as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
others as he hath done. But if you thinke to imploy anie time in making of those, I
would counsell you diligentlie to peruse those waies which my louing Maister (neuer
without reuerence to be named of the musicians) M. <hi>Bird,</hi> and M. <hi>Alphonso</hi> in a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
contention in loue betwixt themselues made vpon the plainsong of <hi>Miserere,</hi> but a
contention, as I saide, in loue: vvhich caused them striue euerie one to surmount ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vvithout malice, enuie, or backbiting: but by great labour, studie and paines, ech
making other censure of that which they had done. Which contention of theirs (speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
without enuie) caused them both become excellent in that kind, and winne such a
name, and gaine such credite, as vvil neuer perish so long as Musicke indureth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there is no vvaie readier to cause you become perfect, then to contend with some
one or other, not in malice (for so is your contention vppon passion, not for loue of
vertue) but in loue, shevving your aduersarie your worke, and not skorning to bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
of him, and to amende your fault if hee speake with reason: but of this enough.
To returne to M. <hi>Bird,</hi> and M. <hi>Alphonso,</hi> though either of them made to the number of
fortie waies, and could haue made infinite more at their pleasure, yet hath one manne,
my friend and fellow M. <hi>George Waterhouse,</hi> vpon the same plainsong of <hi>Miserere,</hi> for
varietie surpassed all who euer laboured in that kinde of studie. For hee hath alreadie
made a thousand waies (yea and though I should talke of halfe as manie more, I should
not be farrewide of the truth) euerie one different and seuerall from another. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I doe hope verie shortlie that the same shall bee published for the benefite of the
worlde, and his owne perpetuall glorie, I will cease to speake anie more of them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to admonish you, that vvho so will be excellent, must both spend much time in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
and looke ouer the dooings of other men. And as for those who stande so much
in opinion of their owne sufficiencie, as in respect of themselues they contemn al other
men, I wil leaue them to their foolish opinions: beeing assured that euerie man but of
meane discretion, will laugh them to scorne as fooles: imagining that all the guiftes of
God should die in themselues, if they shoulde bee taken out of the vvorlde. And as for
foure partes in tvvo, sixe in three, and such like, you may hereafter make them vpon a
plainsong, when you shall haue learned to make them without it.</p>

               <p>Be then attentiue, when I learned descant of my maister <hi>Bould,</hi> hee seeing me
so toward and willing to learne, euer had me in his companie, and because he continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried a plainsong booke in his pocket, hee caused me doe the like, and so walking in
the fieldes, he would sing the plainsong, and cause me sing the descant, and when I song
not to his contentment, he would shew me wherein I had erred, there was also another
descanter, a companion of my maisters, who neuer came in my maisters companie
(though they weare much conuersa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t together) but they fel to contention, striuing who
should bring in the point soonest, and make hardest proportions, so that they thought
they had won great glorie if they had brought in a point sooner, or sung harder propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the one then the other: but it was a worlde to heare them wrangle, euerie one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
his owne for the best. What? (saith the one) you keepe not time in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
you sing them false (saith the other) what proportion is this? (saith hee) <hi>Sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paltery</hi>
saith the other, nay (would the other say) you sing you know not what, it should
seeme you came latelie from a barbers shop, where you had<note n="*" place="margin">That name in derision they haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant pauan, because it wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth amongst the barbars and fidlers more common then any other</note>

plaide in the newe proportions by them latelie found out, called <hi>Sesquiblinda,</hi> and
<hi>Sesqui harken after,</hi> so that if one vnacquainted with musicke had stood in a corner and
heard them, he would haue sworne they had beene out of their wittes, so earnestlie did
they wrangle for a trifle, and in truth I my selfe haue thought sometime that they would
haue gone to round buffets with the matter, for the descant bookes were made <hi>Angels,</hi>
but yet fistes were no visiters of eares, and therefore all parted friendes: but to say the
very truth, this <hi>Poliphemus</hi> had a verie good sight, (speciallie for treble descant) but very
bad vtterance, for that his voice his voice was the worst that euer I heard, and though of
others he were esteemed verie good in that kinde, yet did none thinke better of him
then hee did of himselfe, for if one had named and asked his opinion of the best com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers

he can do nothing else in musik but wrest &amp; wring in hard points vpon a plainsong, they

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12119:65"/>
giue vs leaue to follow it if we list, for we must not thinke but hee that can formally and
artificiallie put there foure, fiue, six or more parts together, may at his ease sing one part
vpon a ground without great studie, for that singing extempore vpon a plainsong is in
deede a peece of cunning, and very necessarie to be perfectly practised of him who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to be a composer for bringing of a quick sight, yet is it a great absurditie so to seeke
for a sight, as to make it the end of our studie applying it to no other vse, for as a knife or
other instrument not being applied to the end for which it was deuised (as to cut) is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
and of no vse, euen so is descant, which being vsed as a helpe to bring readie
sight in setting of parts is profitable, but not being applied to that ende is of it selfe like a
puffe of wind, which being past commeth not againe, which hath beene the reason that
the excellent musitions haue discontinued it, although it be vnpossible for them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
without it, but they rather employ their time in making of songes, which remaine
for the posterity then to sing descant which is no longer known then the singers mouth
is open expressing it, and for the most part cannot be twise repeated in one maner.</p>

               <p>Hauing any two plainesongs giuen you, you must consider what corde the one

8. 10. 12. or 15. to the lowest of them, but if the plainesonges bee distant by a second or
ninth, then must your descant bee a 6. or a 13. to the lowest of them, moreouer, if your
plainesongs stand still in secondes or ninthes, then of force must your descant stand still
in sixts, because there is no other shifts of concord to be had, if your plainesongs be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
by a thirde, then may your descant be a 5. 8. 10. 12 or 15. to the lowest, and if your
plainsonges bee distant by a fourth, then may your descant bee a sixth 8. 13, or 15. to the
lowest of them, likewise if your plainesongs bee a fifth one to another, your descant may
be a 3. or 5. to the lowest of them, but if your plainesongs be in the sixth, then may your
discant be an 8: 10 15. or 17. to the lowest of them: lastly, if your plainsongs be distant a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth,
then may your descant be only a twelfth, also you must note that if the plainsongs
come from a fifth to a second, the lower part ascending two notes, and the higher falling
one (as you may see in the last note of the sixth bar, and first of the seuenth of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
then of force must your descant fall from the tenth to the sixt with the lower plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>song,
and from the sixth to the fith with the higher, and though that falling from the
sixth to the fiftth, both partes descending be not tolerable in other musicke, yet in this

to be taken, and the same faults which are to be shunned in descant must bee auoided in
setting also. And because the setting of two parts is not very farre distant from singing
of descant, we will leaue to speake of it and goe to three partes, and although these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of setting of three parts wil be in a maner superfluous to you, <hi>(Philomathes)</hi> because
to make two parts vpon a plainesong is more hard then to make three partes into volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
yet because your brother either hath not practised that kinde of descant, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
hath not beene taught how to practise it, <hi>I</hi> will set downe those rules which may
serue him both for descant and voluntary, and therefore to bee breefe peruse this Table
wherein you may see all the waies whereby concords may be set together in three parts,
and though I do in it talke of fifteenth and seuententhes, yet are these cordes seldome to
be taken in three parts except of purpose you make your song of much compas and so
you may take what distances you will, but the best maner of composing three voices or
how many soeuer is to cause the parts go close.</p>

               <p>Let this
suffice for one at
this time, and
when you come
to practise, let
the third, fift, and
sixth (sometimes
also an eight) bee
your vsuall cords
because they bee
the sweetest, and
bring most vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
the eight is in three parts seldome to be vsed, except in passing maner or at a close,
and because of all other closes the Cadence is the most vsuall (for without a Cadence
in some one of the parts, either with a discord or without it, it is vnpossible formallie to
close) if you carrie your Cadence in the tenor part you may close all these waies follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and manie others, and as for those waies which here you see marked with a starre
thus * they be passing closes, which we commonly cal false closes, being deuised to shun
a final end and go on with some other purpose, &amp; these passing closes be of two kinds in
the base part, that is, either ascending or descending, if the passing close descend in the
base it commeth to the sixth, if it ascend it commeth to the tenth or third, as in some of
these examples you may see.

I tould you last before of passing closes if your base be a <hi>Cadence</hi> (as your tenor was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not going vnder the base) then will the rule bee contrarie, for whereas before your
base in your false closing did descend to a sixt, nowe must your <hi>Altus</hi> or Tenor (because
sometime the Tenor is aboue the <hi>Altus)</hi> ascend to the sixth or thirteenth and descend
to the tenth or third, as here following you may perceiue.

close, and though it hat beene our vse in times past to end vpon the sixt with the base in
our songes, and speciallie in our <hi>Canons,</hi> yet is it not to bee vsed but vpon an extremitie
of Canon, but by the contraty to be shunned as much as may be, and because it is almost

               <p>Thus much for the composition of the three parts, it followeth to shew you howe to

               <p>Then (that I may discharge my selfe of giuing you any more tables) here is one
which wil serue you for the composition not only of foure parts, but of how many else it
shal please you, for when you compose more then foure parts, you do not put to anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, but double some of those foure, that is, you either make two trebles or two
meanes, or two tenors, or two bases: and I haue kept in the table this order. First to set
down the cord which the treble maketh with the tenor, next how far the base may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the tenor, so that these three parts being so ordained, I set down what cordes
the <hi>Alto</hi> must be to them to make vp the harmony perfect, you must also note that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you find set down for the <hi>Alto</hi> more then one cord, in which case the cordes may
serue not only for the <hi>Alto</hi> but also for such other parts as may be added to the foure, nor
shal you find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Alto</hi> set in an vnison or eight with any of the other parts, except in foure
places, because that when the other parts haue amongst themselues the fifth and thirde,
or their eights of necessitie such parts as shalbe added to them (let them be neuer so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
must bee in the eight or vnion, with some of the three afore named, therefore take

therefore to returne to the other faultes of your lesson, in your fifth and sixth notes, your

note you haue in your tenor part a sharpe eight, which fault I gaue you in your descant

               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>No, for if I had placed the fourth note of the tenor in the counter, and the fourth
note of the counter in the tenor,<note place="margin">For what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son one part may sing that which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may not.</note> then had the third and fourth notes beene two fiftes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

               <p>You say true, and I was a foole who could not conceiue the reason thereof before

               <p>This example I like very wel for these reasons, for
(brother) if you marke the artifice of the composition
you shall see that as the treble ascendeth fiue notes, so
the tenor descendeth fiue notes likewise, the binding of
the third and fourth notes in the tenor, the base ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from a sixth to a fifth, causeth that sharpe fifth to
shew very wel in the eare, and it must needes bee better
then if it had beene taken ascending in the first way as I
desired to haue had it, last of all the counter in the last
foure notes dooth answere the base in fuge from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <p>No, for it must proceede only of the iudgement of the composer, yet the church
men for keeping their keyes haue deuised certaine notes commonlie called the eight
tunes, so that according to the tune which is to be obserued, at that time if it beginne in
such a key, it may end in such and such others, as you shall immediatly know. And these
be (although not the true substance yet) some shadowe of the ancient <hi>modi</hi> whereof <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

infinit volumes of <hi>Mardigals, Canzonets,</hi> and other such ayreable musicke, yea though
he were a priest he would rather choose to excell in that wanton and pleasing musicke

and whereas you iustly complaine of the hate and backbiting amongst the musicions
of our countrey, that I knowe to bee most true, and speciallie in these young fellowes,
who hauing no more skill then to sing a part of a song perfectlie, and scarselie that will
take vpon them to censure excellent men, and to backbite them too, but I would not
wish to liue so long as to see a set of bookes of one of those yong yonkers compositions,

               <p>I perceiue you are cholericke, but let vs returne to your brothers lesson, though
imitation be an excellent thing, yet would I wish no man so to imitate as to take whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
his author saith, be it good or bad, and as for these scapes though in singing they be
quickly ouerpast (as being committed in <hi>Madrigals, Canzonets,</hi> and such like light mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
and in small notes) yet they giue occasion to the ignorant of committing the same
in longer notes, as in Mottets where the fault would bee more offensiue and sooner spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And euen as one with a quicke hand playing vpon an instrument, shewing in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
the agilitie of his fingers, will by the hast of his conueiance cloke manie faultes,
which if they were stoode vpon would mightilie offend the eare, so those musicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the faultes are quickly ouerpast, as being in short notes, thinke them no faultes but
yet wee must learne to distinguish betwixt an instrument playing diuision, and a voice
expressing a dittie, &amp; as for the going from the tenth to the eight in this place ascending,
if the base had descended to <hi>Gam ut,</hi> where it ascended to <hi>G sol re ut,</hi> then had it beene
better, but those fyrie spirits from whence you had it, would rather choose to make a
whole newe song, then to correct one which is already made, although neuer so little
alteration would haue auoided that inconuenient, else woulde they not suffer so manie
fiftes and eightes passe in their workes, yea <hi>Croce</hi> himselfe hath let fiue fiftes together
slip in one of his<note n="*" place="margin">Tste 17. song of his second booke of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drials of 5. voices, in the 11. &amp; 12. semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeues.

no scruple of taking those fiftes, yet will wee leaue to imitate him in that, nor yet will I
take vpon me to saie so much as <hi>Zarlino</hi> doth, though I thinke as much, who in the 29.
chapter of the third part of his <hi>Institutions of musick,</hi> discoursing of taking of those cords
together writeth thus. <hi>Et non si dee hauer riguardo che alcuni habbiano voluto fare il con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trario,
piu presto per presuntione, che per ragione alcuna, che loro habbiano hauuto, come vedia
mo nelle loro compositioni; conciosia che non si deue imitare coloro, che fanno sfacciatamente
contra li buoni costumi, &amp; buoni praecetti d'um' arte &amp; di vna scienza, senza renderne ragione
aleuna: ma dobbiamo imitar quelli, che sono stati obseruatori dei buoni praecetti, &amp; accostar si
aloro &amp; abbracciarli come buoni maestri: lasciando sempre il tristo, &amp; pigliando il buono: &amp;
questo dico per che si comme il videre vnapittura, che sia dipinta convarij colori, magiormen

maggiormente si diletta &amp; pigliapiacere delle consonanze &amp; delle modulationi variate, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
dal diligentissimo compositore nelle sue compositioni, che delli semplici &amp; non variate:</hi>
Which is in English. Nor ought wee to haue any regard though others haue done the
contrary, rather vpon a presumption then any reason which they haue had to doe so, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12119:80"/>
we may see in their compositions: although wee ought not to imitate them, who doe
without any shame go against the good rules and precepts of an Art and a science, with
out giuing any reason for their doings: but we ought to imitate those who haue beene
obseruers of those precepts, ioine vs to them and embrace them as good maisters, euer
leauing the bad and taking the good: and this I say because that euen as a picture pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with diuers cullours doth more delight the eie to beholde it then if it were done but
with one cullour alone, so the eare is more delighted and taketh more pleasure of the
consonants by the diligent musicion placed in his compositions with varietie then of
the simple concords put together without any varietie at all. This much <hi>Zarlino,</hi> yet do
not I speake this, nor seeke this opinion of his, for derogation from <hi>Croce</hi> or any of those
excellent men, but wish as they take great paines to compose, so they will not thinke
much to take a little to correct, and though some of them doe boldly take those fiftes
and eightes, yet shal you hardly find either in master <hi>Alfonso</hi> (except in that place which
I cited to you before) <hi>Orlando, striggio. Clemens non papa,</hi> or any before them, nor shall
you redily find it in the workes of anie of those famous english men who haue beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inferior in art to any of the afore named, as <hi>Farefax, Tauerner, Shepherde, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
White, Persons, M. Birde,</hi> and diuers others, who neuer thought it greater sacrilidge
to spurne against the Image of a Saint then to take two perfect cordes of one kind toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but if you chance to find any such thing in their works you may bee bold to impute
it to the ouersight of the copyers, for copies pasing from hand to hand a smal ouersight
committed by the first writer, by the second will bee made worse, which will giue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the third to alter much both in the wordes and notes, according as shall seeme
best to his owne iudgement, though (God knowes) it will be far enough from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the author, so that errors passing from hand to hand in written copies be easilie
augmented, but for such of their workes as be in print, I dare bee bould to affirme that
in them no such thing is to be found.</p>

               <p>The second fault which <hi>I</hi> dislike in it is in the latter end of the fift bar and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the next, where you stand in eights, for the counter is an eight to the base, and
the tenor an eight to the treble, which fault is committed by leauing out the tenth, but

                  </gap> the third fault of your lesson is in the last note of your seuenth bar,
comming from <hi>B fa b my,</hi> to <hi>F fa ut,</hi> ascending in the tenor part, of
which fault I told you enough in your descant, the like fault of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formal
skipping is in the same notes of the same bar in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, and lastly in the same counterpart you haue left out the Cadence at the close.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>That vnformal fift was committed because I woulde not come from the sixth to
the fifth, ascending betweene the tenor and the treble, but if I had considered where
the note stoode, I would rather haue come from the sixth to the fifth then haue made
it as it is.</p>

               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>That is no excuse for you, for if your partes do not come to your liking, but bee
forced to skip in that order, you may alter the other partes (as being tide to nothing) for
the altering of the leading part will much helpe the thing, so that sometime one part
may lead, and somtime another, according as the nature of the musick or of the point is,
for all points wil not be brought in alike, yet alwaies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> musick is so to be cast as the point
bee not offensiue, being compelled to run into vnisons, and therefore when the partes
haue scope enough, the musicke goeth well, but when they bee so scattered, as though
they lay a loofe, fearing to come neere one to another, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not the harmonie so good.</p>

               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>No, for a Cadence must alwaies bee bound or then odde, driuing a small note
through a greater which the Latins (and those who haue of late daies written the art of

               <p>First of all the beginning is
neither pleasing nor artificial because
of that ninth taken for the last part of
the first note, and first of the nexte
which is a thing vntolerable except
there were a sixth to beare it out, for
discordes are not to bee taken except
they haue vnperfect cordes to beare
them out, likewise betwixt the treble
and counter parts another might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie
bee placed, all the rest of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
is harsh, &amp; the close in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part is both naught and stale like
vnto a garment of a strange fashion, which being new put on for a day or two will please
because of the noueltie, but being worne thread bare, wil grow in contempt, and so this
point when the lesson was made being a newe fashion was admitted for the raritie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the descant was naught, as being onely deuised to bee foisted in at a close a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
many parts, for lacke of other shift, for though the song were of tenne or more
parts, yet would that point serue for one, not troubling any of the rest, but nowe a daies
it is growne in such common vse as diuers will make no scruple to vse it in fewe partes
where as it might well enough be left out, thongh it be very vsuall with our <hi>Organists.</hi>

in your brothers lesson, for the counter is an eight to the treble, and the base an
eight to the tenor, &amp; as the counter commeth in after the treble, so in the same maner
without varietie, the base commeth into the tenor.</p>

               <p>First of all
you begin vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a descorde,
secondlie the
parts be vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
the base is
brought in out
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> key which
faulte is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
because
of not causing the base answere to the counter in the eight, or at least to the tenor, but
because the tenor is in the lowe key, it were too lowe to cause the base answere it in the
eight, and therefore it had beene better in this place to haue brought in the base in <hi>D sol
re,</hi> for by bringing it in <hi>C fa ut,</hi> the counter being in <hi>D la sol re,</hi> you haue changed the aire
and made it quite vnformall, for you must cause your fuge answere your leading parte
either in the fifth, in the fourth, or in the eight, &amp; so likewise euery part to answer other,
although this rule bee not general, yet is it the best manner of maintaining pointes, for
those waies of bringing in of fuges in the third, sixth, and euery such like cordes though
they shew great sight yet are they vnpleasant and seldome vsed.</p>

               <p>The musick is in deed true, but you haue set it in such a key as no man would haue
done, except it had beene to haue plaide it on the Organes with a quier of singing men,
for in deede such shiftes the Organistes are many times compelled to make for ease of
the singers, but some haue brought it from the Organe, and haue gone about to bring
it in common vse of singing with bad successe if they respect their credit, for take me any
of their songes, so set downe and you shall not find a musicion (how perfect soeuer hee
be) able to <hi>sol fa</hi> it right, because he shall either sing a note in such a key as it is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as <hi>la in C sol faut, sol in b fa b my, fa in alamire.</hi> or then hee shall be compelled to
sing one note in two seueral keyes in continual deduction as <hi>fa in b fa b mi,</hi> and <hi>fa in A la
mi re</hi> immediatlie one after another, which is against our very first rule of the singing our
sixe notes or tuninges, and as for them who haue not practised that kind of songes, the
verie sight of those flat cliffes (which stande at the beginning of the verse or line like a
paire of staires, with great offence to the eie, but more to the amasing of the yong singer)
make them mistearme their notes and so go out of tune, wheras by the contrary if your
song were prickt in another key any young scholler might easilie and perfectlie sing it,
and what can they possiblie do with such a number of flat <hi>b b,</hi> which I coulde not as well
bring to passe by pricking the song a note higher? lastly in the last notes of your third bar
and first of the next, and likewise in your last bar you haue committed a grosse ouersight
of leauing out the Cadence, first in your Alto, and lastly in the tenor at the very close,
and as for those notes which you haue put in the tenor part in steede of the Cadence,
though they be true vnto the partes, yet would your Cadence in this place haue beene
farre better, for that you cannot formally close without a Cadence in some one of the
parts, as for the other it is an olde stale fashion of closing commonly vsed in the fift part
to these foure (as you shall knowe more at large when I shall shewe you the practise of
fiue partes) but if you would set downe of purpose to study for the finding out of a bad
close, you could not readily light vpon a worse then this.</p>

<gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
you must note that your song beeing gouerned with flats it is as vnformall to touch a
sharpe eight in <hi>Elami,</hi> as in this key to touch it in <hi>F fa ut,</hi> and in both places the sixth
would haue beene much better, which would haue beene an eight to the treble, besides
(which I had almost forgotten) when they make their songes with those flats, they not
onelie pester the beginning of euery verse with them but also when a note commeth in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12119:83"/>
any place where they should be vsed they will set another flat before it, so that of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
it must in one of the places bee superfluous, likewise I haue seene diuers songes with
those three flats at the beginning of euerie verse, and notwithstanding not one note in
some of the places where the flat is set from the beginning of the song to the ende. But
the strangers neuer pester their verse with those flats, but if the song be naturally flat they
will set one ♭, at the beginning of the verses of euerie part, and if there happen anie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
flat or sharpe they will set the signe before it, which may serue for the note
and no more, likewise if the song bee sharpe if there happen anie extraordinarie flat or
sharpe they will signifie it as before, the signes stil seruing but for that note before which
it standeth and for no more.</p>

it were an easie matter to put in two parts betwixt your treble

your parts in that order, for it maketh the musick seeme wild,

(which standeth in <hi>b</hi> square) in <hi>D sol re</hi> causing it to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of the partes pause while the tenor leadeth and beginneth the fuge which causeth the
musicke to seeme bare and lame, in deede if it had beene at the beginning of the second
part of a song, or after a full close the fault had beene more excusable, but as it is vsed in
this place, it disgraceth the musicke verie much. Sixthly the last note of the fifteenth bar
and first of the next are two fifths in the base and tenor parts. Lastly your close in the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part is so stale that it is almost worme eaten, and generally your treble part lieth so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe
from the rest as though it were afraide to come nigh them, which maketh all the
musicke both vnformall and vnpleasing, for the most artificial forme of composing is to
couch the parts close together, so that nothing may be either added or taken away with
out great hinderance to the other parts.</p>

the fuge is perceaued and the more plainelie decerned, and therefore did the musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
striue to bring in their pointes the soonest they coulde, but the continuation of
that neerenes caused them fall into such a common manner of composing that all their
points were brought in after one sort, so that now there is almost no fuge to be found in
anie booke which hath not beene many times vsed by others, and therefore wee must
giue the fuge some more scope to come in, and by that meanes we shall shew some vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie

               <p>You are too <hi>hyperbolicall</hi> in your phrases, speaking not according to skil, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but in truth it is a most common point, and no more then commonly handled,
but if a man would study, he might vpon it find varietie enough to fil vp many sheets of
paper: yea, though it were giuen to all the musicions of the world they might compose
vpon it, and not one of their compositions be like vnto that of another. And you shall
find no point so wel handled by any man, either Composer or Organist, but with stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
either he himselfe or some other might make it much better. But of this matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,

giue place one to another, and aboue all thinges auoide standing in vnisons, for seeing
they can hardly bee altogether auoided the more care is to bee taken in the good vse of
them, which is best shown in passing notes, and in the last part of a note. The other rules

               <p>It may be that he wil do so at the first, but afterwards when he hath discretion to
decerne the goodnesse of one point aboue another, hee will take the best and leaue the
worst. And in that kind, the Italians and other strangers are greatlie to be commended,
who taking any point in hand, wil not stand long vpon it, but wil take the best of it and so
away to another, whereas by the contrarie, we are so tedious that of one point wee will
make as much as may serue for a whole song, which though it shew great art in variery,
yet is it more then needeth, except one would take vpon them to make a whole fancy of
one point. And in that also you shall find excellent fantasies both of <hi>maister Alfonso, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio

               <p>No man can condemne it in the treble counter or base partes, but the Tenor is
a blemish to the other, and such a blemish as if you will study of purpose to make a bad
part to any others you coulde not possible make a worse, therefore in any case abstaine
from it and such like.</p>

then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you may replie and say the other was fuller because
it did more offende the eare, but by that reason you might likewise
argue that a song full of false descant is fuller then that which is made of true cords. But
(as I tolde you before) the best comming to a close is in binding wise in long drawing
notes (as you see in the first of these examples following) and most chiefely when a fuge
which hath beene in the same song handled is drawne out to make the close in binding
wise, as imagine that this point hath in your song beene maintained <gap reason="music">

               <p>All songs
made by the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
who make
songs by discretion, are either in the high key or in the lowe key. For if you make your
song in the high key, here is the compasse of your musicke, with the forme of setting
the cliffes for euery part.</p>

               <p>But if you would make your song of two trebles you may make the two highest parts
both with one cliffe, in which case one of them is called <hi>Quinto.</hi> If the song bee not of
two trebles, then is the <hi>Quinto</hi> alwaies of the same pitch with the tenor, your <hi>Alto</hi> or
meane you may make high or lowe as you list, setting the cliffe on the lowest or second
rule. If you make your song in the low key, or for meanes then must you keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
and set your cliffe as you see here.

               <p>Now must you diligentlie marke that in which of all these compasses you make your
musicke, you must not suffer any part to goe without the compasse of his rules, except
one note at the most aboue or below, without it be vpon an extremity for the ditties sake
or in notes taken for <hi>Diapasons</hi> in the base. It is true that the high and lowe keyes come
both to one pitch, or rather compasse, but you must vnderstand that those songs which
are made for the high key be made for more life, the other in the low key with more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetie
and staidnesse, so that if you sing them in contrarie keyes, they wil loose their grace
and wil be wrested as it were out of their nature: for take an instrument, as a <hi>Lute Orphad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,
Pandorae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or such like, being in the naturall pitch, and set it a note or two lower it
wil go much heauier and duller, and far from that spirit which it had before, much more
being foure notes lower then the naturall pitch.</p>
               <p>Likewise take a voice being neuer so good, and cause it sing aboue the naturall reach
it will make an vnpleasing and sweete noise, displeasing both the singer because of the
straining, and the hearer because of the wildenes of the sound: euen so, if songes of the
high key be sung in the low pitch, &amp; they of the low key sung in the high pitch, though
it will not be so offensiue as the other, yet will it not breed so much contentment in the
hearer as otherwise it would do. Likewise, in what key soeuer you compose let not your
parts be so far asunder as that you may put in any other betwixt them, (as you haue don
in your last lesson) but keepe them close together, and if it happen that the point cause
them go an eight one from the other (as in the beginning of my example you may see)
yet let them come close together againe, and aboue all thinges keepe the ayre of your
key (be it in the first tune, second tune, or other) except you bee by the wordes forced to
beare it, for the Dittie (as you shall know hereafter) will compell the author many times
to admit great absurdities in his musicke, altering both time, tune, cullour ayre and what
soeuer else, which is commendable so hee can cunninglie come into his former ayre
againe.</p>

and reuerted. And though your foreright fuges be verie good, yet are they such as any
man of skil may in a manner at the first sight bring in, if hee doe but heare the leading part
sung: but this way of two or three seueral points going together is the most artificiall kinde of
composing which hetherto hath beene inuented, either for Motets or <hi>Madrigals,</hi> speciallie

vpon, but once or twice driuen through all the partes, and sometimes reuerted, and so to the
close then taking another and that kind of handling points is most esteemed in <hi>Madrigals</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of fiue or sixe parts, specially when two parts go one way, and two another way, and most
commonly in tenthes or thirdes, as you may see in my former example of fiue parts, of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
two points or more at once. Likewise the more varietie of points bee shewed in one

full, sometimes very single, sometimes iumping together, and somtime quite contrarie waies,

               <p>There be also some compositions which at the first sight will seeme very hard to bee done,
yet hauing the rules of the composition of them deliuered vnto you, they wil seeme very easie
to be made, as to make two partes in one, to be repeated as oft as you will, and at euerie repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to fall a note, which though it seeme strange, yet it is performed by taking your finall
Cadence one note lower then your first note was, making your first the close, as in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>Likewise you may make eight partes in foure (or fewer or more as you list) which may bee
sung backward &amp; forward, that is, one beginning at the beginning of euery part, and another
at the ending, and so sing it quight through, and the rules to make it be these, make how many
parts you list, making two of a kind (as two trebles, two tenors, two counters, and two bases)
but this caueat you must haue, that at the beginning of the song al the parts must begin toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
full, and that you must not set any pricke in all the song (for though in singing the part
forward it wil go wel, yet when the other commeth backward it wil make a disturbance in the
musicke because the singer wil be in a doubt to which note the pricke belongeth. For if hee
should hould it out with the note which it followeth it would make an odde number, or then
he must hold it in that tune wherin the following note is, making it of that time as if it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that note, which would be a great absurdtirie to set a prieke before the note, of which it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the time: hauing so made your song, you must set one part at the end of the other of the
same kind (as treble after treble, base after base, &amp;c.) so that the end of the one be ioined to the
end of the other, so shall your musicke go right forward and backward, as thus for example.</p>

Foure parts in one in the vnison.</p>
               <p>Nowe hauing discoursed vnto you the composition of three,<note place="margin">Rules to be obserued in dittying.</note> foure, fiue and sixe
partes with these fewe waies of Canons and catches:</p>
               <p>It followeth to shew you how to dispose your musicke according to the nature of the words
which you are therein to expresse, as whatsoeuer matter it be which you haue in hand, such a
kind of musicke must you frame to it. You must therefore if you haue a graue matter, applie a
graue kinde of musicke to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if a merrie subiect you must make your musicke also merrie. For
it will be a great absurditie to vse a sad harmonie to a merrie matter, or a merrie harmonie to
a sad lamentable or tragicall dittie. You must then when you would expresse any word signify<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
hardnesse, crueltie, bitternesse, and other such like, make the harmonie like vnto it, that is,
somwhat harsh and hard but yet so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it offend not. Likewise, when any of your words shal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
complaint, dolor, repentance, sighs, teares, and such like, let your harmonie be sad and
doleful, so that if you would haue your musicke signifie hardnes, cruelty or other such affects,
you must cause the partes proceede in their motions without the halfe note, that is, you must
cause them proceed by whole notes, sharpe thirdes, sharpe sixes and such like (when I speake
of sharpe or flat thirdes, and sixes, you must vnderstand that they ought to bee so to the base)
you may also vse Cadences bound with the fourth or seuenth, which being in long notes will
exasperat the harmonie: but when you woulde exprrsse a lamentable passion, then must you
vse motions proceeding by halfe notes. Flat thirdes and flat sixes, which of their nature are
sweet, speciallie being taken in the true tune and naturall aire with discretion and iudgement.
but those cordes so taken as I haue saide before are not the sole and onely cause of expressing
those passions, but also the motions which the parts make in singinng do greatly helpe, which
motions are either naturall or accidental. The naturall motions are those which are naturallie
made betwixt the keyes without the mixture of any accidentall signe or corde, be it either flat
or sharpe, and these motions be more masculine causing in the song more virilitie then those
accidentall cordes which are marked with these signes. <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>. ♭. which be in deede accidentall,
and make the song as it were more effeminate &amp; languishing then the other motions which
make the song rude and sounding: so that those naturall motions may serue to expresse those
effectes of crueltie, tyrannie, bitternesse and such others, and those accidentall motions
may fitlie expresse the passions of griefe, weeping, sighes, sorrowes, sobbes, and such
like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:12119:94"/>
Also, if the subiect be light, you must cause your musicke go in motions, which carrie with
them a celeritie or quicknesse of time, as minimes, crotchets and quauers: if it be lamentable,
the note must goe in slow and heauie motions, as semibreues, breues and such like, and of all
this you shall finde examples euerie where in the workes of the good musicians. Moreouer,
you must haue a care that when your matter signifieth ascending, high heauen, and such like,
you make your musicke ascend: and by the contrarie where your dittie speaketh of descending
lowenes, depth, hell, and others such, you must make your musicke descend, for as it will be
thought a great absurditie to talke of heauen and point downwarde to the earth: so will it be
counted great incongruitie if a musician vpon the wordes hee ascended into heauen shoulde
cause his musicke descend, or by the contrarie vpon the descension should cause his musicke
to ascend. We must also haue a care so to applie the notes to the wordes, as in singing there
be no barbarisme committed: that is, that we cause no sillable which is by nature short be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by manie notes or one long note, nor no long sillable bee expressed with a shorte
note, but in this fault do the practitioners erre more grosselie, then in any other, for you shall
find few songes wherein the penult sillables of these words, <hi>Dominus, Angelus, filius, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,
gloria,</hi> and such like are not expressed with a long note, yea many times with a whole
dossen of notes, and though one should speak of fortie he should not say much amisse, which
is a grosse barbarisme, &amp; yet might be easelie amended. We must also take heed of seperating
any part of a word from another by a rest, as som dunces haue not slackt to do, yea one whose
name is <hi>Iohannes Dunstaple</hi> (an ancient English author) hath not onlie deuided the sentence,
but in the verie middle of a word hath made two long rests thus, in a song of foure parts vpon
these words, <hi>Nesciens virgo mater virum.</hi>

               <p>For these be his owne notes and wordes, which is one of the greatest absurdities which I
haue seene committed in the dittying of musicke, but to shewe you in a worde the vse of the
rests in the dittie, you may set a crotchet or minime rest aboue a coma or colon, but a longer
rest then that of a minime you may not make till the sentence bee perfect, and then at a full
point you may set what number of rests you will. Also when you would expresse sighes, you
may vse the crotchet or minime rest at the most, but a longer then a minime rest you may not
vse, because it will rather seeme a breth taking then a sigh, an example whereof you may see
in a very good song of <hi>Stephano venturi</hi> to fiue voices vpon this dittie <hi>quell'aura che spirando
a Paura mia?</hi> for comming to the worde <hi>sospiri</hi> (that is sighes) he giueth it such a natural grace
by breaking a minime into a crotchet rest and a crotchet, that the excellency of his iudgment
in expressing and gracing his dittie doth therein manifestlie appeare. Lastlie, you must not
make a close (especiallie a full close) till the full sence of the words be perfect: so that keeping
these rules you shall haue a perfect agreement, and as it were a harmonicall concent betwixt
the matter and the musicke, and likewise you shall bee perfectly vnderstoode of the auditor
what you sing, which is one of the highest degrees of praise which a musicion in dittying can
attaine vnto or wish for. Many other pettie obseruations there be which of force must be left
out in this place, and remitted to the discretion and good iudgement of the skilful composer.</p>

                  <p>Now (sir) seeing you haue so largely discoursed of framing a fit musicke to the nature

                  <p>Although by that which <hi>I</hi> haue alreadie shewed you, you might with studie collect
the nature of all kindes of musicke, yet to ease you of that paine, I will satisfie your request
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:12119:94"/>
though not at full, yet with so many kinds as <hi>I</hi> can call to memorie: for it wil be a hard matter
vpon the suddaine to remember them al, and therfore (to go to the matter roundly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
circumstances) I say that all musicke for voices (for onlie of that kinde haue we hetherto
spoken) is made either for a dittie or without a dittie, if it bee with a dittie, it is either graue or
light, the graue ditties they haue stil kept in one kind, so that whatsoeuer musicke bee made
vpon it, is comprehended vnder the name of a Motet: a Motet is properlie a song made for
the church, either vpon some hymne or Antheme, or such like, and that name I take to haue
beene giuen to that kinde of musicke in opposition to the other which they called <hi>Canto fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
and we do commonlie call plainsong, for as nothing is more opposit to standing and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
then motion, so did they giue the Motet that name of mouing, because it is in a manner
quight contrarie to the other, which after some sort, and in respect of the other standeth still.
This kind of al others which are made on a ditty, requireth most art, and moueth and causeth
most strange effects in the hearer, being aptlie framed for the dittie and well expressed by the
singer, for it will draw the auditor (and speciallie the skilfull auditor) into a deuout and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
kind of consideration of him for whose praise it was made. But I see not what passions or
motions it can stirre vp, being sung as most men doe commonlie sing it: that is, leauing out
the dittie and singing onely the bare note, as it were a musicke made onelie for instruments,
which will in deed shew the nature of the musicke, but neuer carrie the spirit and (as it were)
that liuelie soule which the dittie giueth, but of this enough. And to returne to the expressing
of the ditty, the matter is now come to that state that though a song be neuer so wel made &amp;
neuer so aptlie applied to the words, yet shal you hardlie find singers to expresse it as it ought
to be, for most of our church men, (so they can crie louder in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quier then their fellowes) care
for no more, whereas by the contrarie, they ought to studie howe to vowell and sing cleane,
expressing their wordes with deuotion and passion, whereby to draw the hearer as it were in
chaines of gold by the eares to the consideration of holie things. But this for the most part,
you shall find amongst them, that let them continue neuer so long in the church, yea though
it were twentie yeares, they will neuer studie to sing better then they did the first day of their
preferment to that place, so that it should seeme that hauing obtained the liuing which they
sought for, they haue little or no care at all either of their owne credit, or well discharging of
that dutie whereby they haue their maintenance. But to returne to our Motets, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in this kind, you must cause your harmonie to carrie a maiestie taking discordes and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
so often as you canne, but let it be in long notes, for the nature of it will not beare short
notes and quicke motions, which denotate a kind of wantonnes.</p>
                  <p>This musicke (a lamentable case) being the chiefest both for art and vtilitie, is notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
little esteemed, and in small request with the greatest number of those who most highly
seeme to fauor art, which is the cause that the composers of musick who otherwise would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the depth of their skill, in this kinde are compelled for lacke of <hi>moecenates</hi> to put on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humor, and follow that kind wherunto they haue neither beene brought vp, nor yet (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
so much as they can learne by seeing other mens works in an vnknown tounge) doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie
vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of it, such be the newfangled opinions of our countrey men, who
will highlie esteeme whatsoeuer commeth from beyond the seas, and speciallie from Italie,
be it neuer so simple, contemning that which is done at home though it be neuer so excellent.
Nor yet is that fault of esteeming so highlie the light musicke particular to vs in England, but
generall through the world, which is the cause that the musitions in all countries and chiefely
in Italy, haue imploied most of their studies in it: whereupon a learned man of our time wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vpon <hi>Cicero</hi> his dreame of <hi>Scipio</hi> saith, that the musicians of this age, in steed of drawing
the minds of men to the consideration of heauen and heauenlie thinges, doe by the contrarie
set wide open the gates of hell, causing such as delight in the excercise of their art tumble
headlong into perdition.</p>
                  <p>This much for Motets, vnder which I comprehend all graue and sober musicke, the light

hath not beene followed to the full,<note place="margin">A Madrigal</note> but the best kind of it is termed <hi>Madrigal,</hi> a word for the
etymologie of which I can giue no reason, yet vse sheweth that it is a kinde of musicke made
vpon songs and sonnets, such as <hi>Petrarcha</hi> and many Poets of our time haue excelled in This
kind of musicke weare not so much disalowable if the Poets who compose the ditties would
abstaine from some obscenities, which all honest eares abhor, and sometime from blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to such as this, <hi>ch'altro di te iddio non voglio</hi> which no man (at least who hath any hope
of saluation) can sing without trembling. As for the musick it is next vnto the Motet, the most
artificiall and to men of vnderstanding most delightfull. If therefore you will compose in this
kind you must possesse your selfe with an amorus humor (for in no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position shal you proue
admirable except you put on, and possesse your selfe wholy with that vaine wherein you com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose)
so that you must in your mnsicke be wauering like the wind, sometime wanton, somtime
drooping, sometime graue and staide, otherwhile effeminat, you may maintaine points and
reuert them, vse triplaes and shew the verie vttermost or your varietie, and the more varietie
you shew the better shal you please. In this kind our age excelleth, so that if you would imitate
any, I would appoint you these for guides: <hi>Alfonso ferrabosco</hi> for deepe skill, <hi>Luca Maren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
for good ayre and fine inuention, <hi>Horatto Vecchi, Stephano Venturi, Ruggiero Giouanelli,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn Croce,</hi> with diuers others who are verie good, but not so generallie good as these. The
seconde degree of grauetie in this light musicke is giuen to Canzonets that is little shorte
songs (wherin little arte can be shewed being made in straines,<note place="margin">Canzonets</note> the beginnng of which is some
point lightlie touched, and euerie straine repeated except the middle) which is in compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the musick a counterfet of the <hi>Madrigal.</hi> Of the nature of these are the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> or
<hi>Canzone a la Napolitana,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Neapolita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> different from them in nothing sauing in name, so that whosoeuer
knoweth the nature of the one must needs kuow the other also, and if you thinke them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of your paines to compose them, you haue a patterne of them in <hi>Luco Marenzo</hi> and <hi>Iohn
Feretti,</hi> who as it should seeme hath imploied most of all his study that way. The last degree
of grauetie (if they haue any at all is giuen to the <hi>villanelle</hi> or countrie songs which are made
only for the ditties sake,<note place="margin">Villenelle.</note> for so they be aptly set to expresse the nature of the ditty, the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
(though he were neuer so excellent) will not sticke to take many perfect cordes of one kind
together, for in this kind they thinke it no fault (as being a kind of keeping <hi>decorum)</hi> to make
a clownish musicke to a clownish matter, &amp; though many times the dittie be fine enough yet
because it carrieth that name <hi>villanella</hi> they take those disallowances as being good enough
for plow and cart There is also another kind more light then this,<note place="margin">Ballette.</note> which they tearme <hi>Ballete</hi>
or daunces, and are songs, which being song to a dittie may likewise be daunced: these and all
other kinds of light musicke sauing the <hi>Madrigal</hi> are by a generall name called ayres. There
be also an other kind of <hi>Ballets,</hi> commonlie called <hi>falas,</hi> the first set of that kind which I haue
seene was made by <hi>Gastaldi,</hi> if others haue laboured in the same field, I know not but a slight
kind of musick it is, &amp; as I take it deuised to be daunced to voices. The slightest kind of musick
(if they deserue the name of musicke) are the <hi>vinate</hi> or drincking songes,<note place="margin">Vinate</note> for as I said before,
there is no kinde of vanitie whereunto they haue not applied some musicke or other, as they
haue framde this to be sung in their drinking, but that vice being so rare among the Italians,
&amp; Spaniards: I rather thinke that musicke to haue bin deuised by or for the Germains (who in
swarmes do flocke to the Vniuersitie of Italie) rather then for the Italians themselues.<note place="margin">Iustinianes.</note> There is
likewise a kind of songs) which I had almost forgotten) called <hi>Iustinianas,</hi> and are al written in
the <hi>Bergamasca</hi> language a wanton and rude kinde of musicke it is, and like enough to carrie
the name of some notable Curtisan of the Citie of <hi>Bergama,</hi> for no man will denie that <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niana</hi>
is the name of a woman. There be also many other kindes of songes which the Italians
make as <hi>Pasterellas</hi> and <hi>Passamesos</hi> with a dittie and such like,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pastorelle passamezos</hi> with ditties Fantasies.</note> which it would be both tedious
and superfluons to delate vnto you in words, therfore I will leaue to speake any more of them,
and begin to declare vnto you those kinds which they make without ditties. The most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:12119:95"/>
and chiefest kind of musicke which is made without a dittie is the fantasie, that is, when
a musician taketh a point at his pleasure, and wresteth and turneth it as he list, making either
much or little of it according as shall seeme best in his own conceit. In this may more art be
showne then in any other musicke, because the composer is tide to nothing but that he may
adde, deminish, and alter at his pleasure. And this kind will beare any allowances whatsoeuer
tolerable in other musick, except changing the ayre &amp; leauing the key, which in fantasie may
neuer bee suffered. Other thinges you may vse at your pleasure, as bindings with discordes,
quicke motions, slow motions, proportions, and what you list. Likewise, this kind of musick
is with them who practise instruments of parts in greatest vse, but for voices it is but sildome
vsed. The next in grauery and goodnes vnto this is called a pauane, a kind of staide musicke,
ordained for graue dauncing,<note place="margin">Pauens.</note> and most commonlie made of three straines, whereof euerie
straine is plaid or sung twice, a straine they make to containe 8. 12. or 16. semibreues as they
list, yet fewer then eight I haue not seene in any pauan. In this you may not so much insist in
following the point as in a fantasie: but it shal be inough to touch it once and so away to some
close. Also in this you must cast your musicke by foure, so that if you keepe that rule it is no
matter howe many foures you put in your straine, for it will fall out well enough in the ende,
the arte of dauncing being come to that perfection that euerie reasonable dauncer wil make
measure of no measure, so that it is no great matter of what number you make your strayne.
After euery pauan we vsually set a galliard (that is, a kind of musicke made out of the other)
causing it go by a measure,<note place="margin">Galliards.</note> which the learned cal <hi>trochaieam rationem,</hi> consisting of a long and
short stroke successiuelie, for as the foote <hi>trochaeus</hi> consisteth of one sillable of two times, and
another of one time, so is the first of these two strokes double to the latter: the first beeing in
time of a semibrefe, and the latter of a minime. This is a lighter and more stirring kinde of
dauncing then the pauane consisting of the same number of straines, and looke howe manie
foures of semibreues, you put in the straine of your pauan, so many times sixe minimes must
you put in the straine of your galliard. The Italians make their galliardes (which they tearme
<hi>saltarelli)</hi> plaine, and frame ditties to them, which in their <hi>mascaradoes</hi> they sing and daunce,
and many times without any instruments at all, but in steed of instrumentes they haue Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans
disguised in mens apparell,<note place="margin">Almanes.</note> who sing and daunce to their owne songes. The <hi>Alman</hi> is a
more heauie daunce then this (fitlie representing the nature of the people, whose name it
carieth) so that no extraordinarie motions are vsed in dauncing of it. It is made of strains, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two, sometimes three, and euerie straine is made by foure, but you must marke that the
foure of the pauan measure is in <hi>dupla</hi> proportion to the foure of the <hi>Alman</hi> measure, so that
as the vsuall Pauane conteineth in a straine the time of sixteene semibreues, so the vsuall <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>
containeth the time of eight, and most commonlie in short notes. Like vnto this is the
French <hi>bransle</hi> (which they cal <hi>bransle simple)</hi> which goeth somwhat rounder in time the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this,<note place="margin">Bransles.</note>
otherwise the measure is all one. The <hi>bransle de poictou</hi> or <hi>bransle double</hi> is more quick in time,
(as being in a rounde Tripla) but the straine is longer, containing most vsually twelue whole
strokes.<note place="margin">Voltes cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes.</note> Like vnto this (but more light) be the <hi>voltes</hi> and <hi>courantes</hi> which being both of a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
ar notwithstanding daunced after sundrie fashions,<note place="margin">Countrey daunces.</note> the <hi>volte</hi> rising and leaping, the <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante</hi>
trauising and running, in which measure also our countrey daunce is made, though it
be daunced after another forme then any of the former. All these be made in straines, either
two or three as shall seeme best to the maker, but the <hi>courant</hi> hath twice so much in a straine,
as the English country daunce. There bee also many other kindes of daunces (as <hi>hornepypes
Iygges</hi> and infinite more) which I cannot nominate vnto you, but knowing these the rest can
not but be vnderstood,<note place="margin">Diuers men diuersly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes of musicke.</note> as being one with some of these which <hi>I</hi> haue alreadie told you. And
as there be diuers kinds of musicke, so will some mens humors be more enclined to one kind
then to another. As some wilbe good descanters, and excell in descant, and yet wil be but bad
composers, others will be good composers and but bad descanters extempore vpon a plaine
song, some will excel in composition of Motets, and being set or inioyned to make a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigal.</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:12119:96"/>
wil be very far from the nature of it, likewise some will be so possessed with the <hi>Madri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
humor, as no man may be compared with them in that kind, and yet being enioyned to
compose a motet or some sad and heauy musicke, wil be far from the excellecie which they
had in their owne vaine. Lastlie, some will be so excellent in points of voluntary vpon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
as one would thinke it vnpossible for him not to be a good composer, and yet being
inioynd to make a song wil do it so simplie as one would thinke a scholler of one yeares prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
might easely compose a better. And I dare boldly affirme, that looke which is hee who
thinketh himselfe the best descanter of all his neighbors, enioyne him to make but a scottish
lygge, he will grossely erre in the true nature and qualitie of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue you briefelie those preceptes which <hi>I</hi> thinke necessarie and sufficient for you,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion of the dialogue.</note>

in the practise. Seeing therefore you lacke nothing of perfect musicians, but only vse to make
you prompt and quicke in your compositions, and that practise must only bee done in time,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HVS hast thou (gentle Reader) my booke after that simple sort, as I thought most conuenient for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
in which if they dislike the words (as bare of eloquence and lacking fine phrases to allure the minde of
the Reader) let them consider that <hi>ornari res ipsa negat contenta doceri,</hi> that the matter it selfe denieth to bee set
out with flourish, but is contented to bee deliuered after a plaine and common maner, and that my intent in
this booke hath beene to teach musicke, not eloquence, also that the scholler wil enter in the reading of it for
the matter not for the words. Moreouer there is no man of discretion but will thinke him foolish who in the precepts of an
arte wil looke for filed speech, rethorical sentences, that being of all matters which a man can intreate of, the most humble
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:12119:96"/>
and with most simplicitie and sinceritie to be handled, and to decke a lowlie matter with loftie and swelling, speech wil be
to put simplicitie in plumes of feathers and a Carter in cloth of golde. But if any man of skill (for by such I loue to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
contemning the iniuries of the ignorant, and making as little account of them as the moone doth of the barking of a
dog) shall thinke me either defectuous or faulty in the necessarie precepts, let him boldlie set downe in print such things as
I haue either left out or falsely set downe, which if it be done without railing or biting words against me, I wil not only take
for no disgrace, but by the contrarie esteeme of it as of a great good turne as one as willing to learne that which I know not,
as to instruct others of that which I know: for I am not of their mind who enuie the glorie of other men, but by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
giue them free course to run in the same field of praise which I haue done, not scorning to be taught, or make my profit
of their works, so it be without their praeiudice, thinking it praise enough for me, that I haue bin the first who in our tongue
haue put the practise of musick in this forme: And that I may say with Horace, <hi>Libera per vacuum posui vestigia princeps,</hi> that I
haue broken the Ice for others. And if any man shal cauil at my vsing of the authorities of other men, and thinke thereby to
discredit the booke, I am so far from thinking that any disparagement to me that I rather thinke it a greater credit. For if in
diuinity, Law, and other sciences it be not only tollerable but commendable to cite the authorities of doctors for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their opinions, why should it not bee likewise lawfull for me to doe that in mine Arte which they commonlie vse in
theirs, and confirme my opinion by the authorities of those who haue bin no lesse famous in musicke then either <hi>Paulus,
Vlpianus, Bartolus</hi> or <hi>Baldus,</hi> (who haue made so many asses ride on foote clothes) haue beene in law. As for the examples
they be all mine own, but such of them as be in controuerted matters, though I was counsailed to take them of others, yet
to auoid the wrangling of the enuious I made them my selfe, confirmed by the authorities of the best authors extant. And
where as some may obiect that in the first part there is nothing which hath not already beene handled by some others, if
they would indifferently iudge they might answere themselues with this saying of the comicall Poet, <hi>nihil dictum quod non
dictum prius,</hi> and in this matter though I had made it but a bare translation, yet could I not haue been iustly blamed, seeing
I haue set downe such matters as haue beene hetherto vnknowne to may, who otherwise are reasonable good musicians,
but such as know least wil be readiest to condemne. And though the first part of the booke be of that nature that it coulde
not haue beene set downe but with that which others haue doone before, yet shall you not finde in any one booke all those
things which there be handled, but I haue had such an especial care in collecting them that the most common things, which
euerie where are to be had be but slenderlie touched. Other things which are as necessary &amp; not so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon are more largely
handled, &amp; also plainly &amp; after so familiar a sort deliuered, as none (how ignorant soeuer) can iustly complaine of obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But some haue beene so foolish as to say that I haue emploied much trauell in vaine in seeking out the depth of those
moodes and other things which I haue explained, and haue not stucke to say that they be in no vse, and that I can write no
more then they know already. Surely what they know already I know not, but if they account the moodes, ligatures, pricks
of deuision and alteration, augmentation, diminution and proportious, thinges of no vse, they may as well account the
whole arte of musick of no vse, seeing that in the knowledge of them consisteth the whole or greatest part of the knowledge
of pricksong. And although it be true that the proportions haue not such vse in musicke in that forme as they be nowe vsed,
but that the practise may: be perfect without them, yet seeing they haue beene in common vse with the musicians of former
time, it is necessarie for vs to know them, if we meane to make any profit of their works. But those men who think they know
enough already, when (God knoweth) they can scarce sing their part with the wordes, be like vnto those who hauing once
superficiallie red the Tenors of <hi>Littleton</hi> or <hi>Iustinians institutes,</hi> thinke that they haue perfectlie learned the whole law, and
then being inioyned to discusse a case, do at length perceiue their own ignorance and beare the shame of their falsely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
opinions But to such kind of men do I not wright, for as a man hauing brought a horse to the water cannot compel
him to drink except he list, so may I write a booke to such a man but cannot compell him to reade it: But this difference is
betwixt the horse and the man, that the horse though hee drinke not will notwithstanding returne quietly with his keeper
to the stable, and not kicke at him for bringing him fourth: our man by the contrarie will not onelie not reade that which
might instruct him, but also wil backbite and maligne him, who hath for his and other mens benefit vndertaken great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
and endured much paine, more then for any priuat gaine or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie in particular redounding to himself. And though
in the first part I haue boldlie taken that which in particular I cannot challenge to be mine owne, yet in the second part I
haue abstained from it as much as is possible, for except the cords of descant, and that common rule of prohibited conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of perfect cordes, there is nothing in it which I haue seene set downe in writing by others. And if in the Canons I
shall seeme to haue too much affected breuity, you must knowe that I haue purposely left that part but slenderly handled,
both because the scholler may by his own studie become an accomplished musicion, hauing perfectly practised those fewe
rules which be there set down, as also because I do shortly looke for the publication in print, of those neuer enough praised
trauailes of master Waterhouse, whose flowing and most sweet springs in that kind may be sufficient to quench the thirst of
the most insaciate scholler whatsoeuer. But if mine opinion may be in any estimation with him, I would counsaile him that
when he doth publish his labours, he would set by euery seuerall way some words whereby the learner may perceaue it to
be a Canon, and how one of the parts is brought out of another (for many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I haue seene be so intricate as being
prickt in seuerall bookes one shall hardly perceaue it to be any Canon at al): so shal he by his labors both most benefit his
Countrey in shewing the inuention of such variety, and reape most commendations to himselfe in that he hath beene the
first who hath inuented it. And as for the last part of the booke there is nothing in it which is not mine owne, and in that
place I haue vsed so great facilitie as none (howe simple soeuer) but may at the first reading conceaue the true meaning of
the words, and this haue I so much affected, because that part wil be both most vsual and most profitable to the young prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticioners,
who (for the most part) know no more learning then to write their owne names. Thus hast thou the whole forme
of my booke, which if thou accept in that good meaning wherein it was written, I haue hit the marke which I shot at: if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
accept my good wil, who would haue don better if I could. But if thou thinke the whole arte not worthy the pains
of any good wit or learning, though I might answere as <hi>Alfonso</hi> king of <hi>Aragon</hi> did to one of his Courtiers (who saying that
the knowledge of sciences was not requisite in a noble man, the king gaue him onelie this answere <hi>questa é voce dun bus non

musicke as that he calleth it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
and profitable for the seeking out of that which is good and honest. Also in the first book of his lawes he saith that
<pb facs="tcp:12119:97"/>
musick cannot be intreated or taught without the knowledge of all other sciences, which if it be true, how far hath the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
of that time beene different from ours, which by the negligence of the prosessors is almost fallen into the nature of a
mechanicall arte, rather then reckoned in amongst other sciences. The next authoritie I may take from <hi>Aristophanes</hi> who
though he many times scoffe at other sciences, yet tearmeth he musick <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a perfect knowledge of al scien<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
&amp; disciplines. But the Authorites of <hi>Aristoxenus Ptolomaeus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Seuerinus Boethius,</hi> who haue painefully deliuered the arte
to vs, may be sufficient to cause the best wits think it worthy their trauel, specially of <hi>Boethius</hi> who being by birth noble and
most excellent well versed in Diuinity, Philosophy, Law, Mathematicks Poetry, and matters of estate, did notwithstanding
write more of musick then of al the other mathematical sciences, so that it may be iustly said, that if it had not beene for him
the knowledge of musicke had not yet come into our Westerne part of the world. The Greeke tongue lying as it were dead
vnder the <hi>barbarisme</hi> of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Hunnes,</hi> and musicke buried in the howels of the Greeke works of <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> and <hi>Arir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stexenus,</hi>
the one of which as yet hath neuer come to light, but lies in written copies in some Bibliothekes of Italy, the other
hath beene set out in print, but the copies are euery where so scant and hard to come by, that many doubt if he haue beene
set out or no. And these few authorities wil serue to diswade the discreet from the afore named opinion, (because few dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete
men wil hold it) as for others many will be so selfe willed in their opinions, that though a man should bring all
the arguments and authorities in the world against it, yet should he not perswade them to leaue it. But if
any man shall thinke me prolix and tedious in this place, I must for that point craue pardon, &amp; wil
here make an end, wishing vnto all men that discretion as to measure so to other
men as they would bee measured themselues.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had ended my booke, and showen it (to be peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
to some of better skill in letters then my selfe, I was by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
requested, to giue some contentment to the learned, both by
setting down a reason why I had disagreed from the opinions
of others, as also to explaine something, which in the booke it
selfe might seeme obscure. I haue therefore thought it best to
set downe in Annotations, such things as in the text could not
so commodiouslie be handled, for interrupting of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
course of the matter, that both the young beginner shoulde
not be ouerladed with those things, which at the firste woulde
be to hard for him to conceiue: and also that they who were
more skilful, might haue a reason for my proceedings. I would
therefore counsel the young scholler in Musicke, not to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
himselfe in the reading of these notes, til he haue perfectly
learned the booke it selfe, or at least the first part thereof: for
without the knowledge of the booke, by reading of them, hee
shal runne into such confusion, as hee shall not know where to begin or where to leaue. But thou
(learned Reader) if thou find any thing which shal not be to thy liking, in friendship aduertise me
that I may either mend it, or scrape it out. And so I ende, protesting that <hi>Errare possum haereticus es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 2. vers. 26. The scale of Musicke)</hi> I haue omitted the definition and diuision of musicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the greatest part of those, for whose sake the booke was taken in hand, and who chieflie are
to vse it: be either altogither vnlearned, or then haue not so farre proceeded in learning, as to vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stand
the reason of a definition: and also because amongst so many who haue written of musicke, I
knew not whom to follow in the definition. And therefore I haue left it to the discretion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to take which he list of all these which I shal set downe. The most auncient of which is by <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
set out in his <hi>Theages</hi> thus, Musicke (saith he) <hi>is a knowledge</hi> (for so I interpret the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
which in that place he vseth) <hi>whereby we may rule a company of singers, or singers in companies</hi> (or
<hi>quire,</hi> for so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifieth.) But in his <hi>Banquet</hi> he giueth this definition. <hi>Musick,</hi> saith
he, <hi>is a science of loue matters occupied in harmonie and rythmos. Boetius</hi> distinguisheth and theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or speculatiue musicke he defineth, in the first chapter of the fift booke of his musicke, <hi>Facultas
differentias acutorum &amp; grauium sonorum sensu as ratione perpendens.</hi> A facultie considering the dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference
of high and lowe soundes by sence and reason. <hi>Augustine</hi> defineth practicall musicke
(which is that which we haue now in hand) <hi>Recto medu landi scientia,</hi> A science of well dooing by
time, tune, or number, for in al these three is <hi>modulan di peitia</hi> occupied. <hi>Franchinus gaufurius</hi> thus
<hi>Musica est proportionabilium sonorum concinnis interuallis disiunctorum dispositio sensu ac ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
consonantiam monstrans.</hi> A disposition of proportionable soundes deuided by apt distances, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
by sence and reason, the agreement in sound. Those who haue byn since his time, haue doon
it thus, <hi>Rite &amp; bene canendi scientia,</hi> A Science of duly and wel singing, a science of singing wel in
tune and number <hi>Ars bene canendi,</hi> an Art of wel singing. Now I saie, let euery man follow what
definition he list. As for the diuision, Musicke is either <hi>speculatiue</hi> or <hi>practicall. Speculatiue is that
kinde of musicke</hi> which by Mathematical helpes, seeketh out the causes, properties, and natures of
soundes by themselues, and compared with others proceeding no further, but content with the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:12119:103"/>
contemplation of the Art. <hi>Practical</hi> is that which teacheth al that may be knowne in songs, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the vnderstanding of other mens, or making of ones owne, and is of three kindes: <hi>Diatoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,
chromaticum,</hi> and <hi>Enharmonicum. Diatonicum,</hi> is that which is now in vse, &amp; riseth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the scale by a whole, not a whole note and a lesse halfe note (a whole note is that which
the Latines call <hi>integer tonus,</hi> and is that distance which is betwixt any two notes, except <hi>mi</hi> &amp; <hi>fa.</hi>
For betwixt <hi>mi</hi> and <hi>fa</hi> is not a full halfe note, but is lesse then halfe a note by a <hi>comma:</hi> and therfore
called the lesse halfe note) in this maner. <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Chromaticum,</hi> is that which riseth by <hi>se
mitonium minus</hi> (or the lesse halfe note)
the greater halfe note, and three halfe notes thus:
(the greater halfe note is that distance which is betwixt <hi>fa</hi> and <hi>mi,<gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
in <hi>b fa ♮ mi.) Enharmonicum,</hi> is that which riseth by <hi>diesis, diesis,
(diesis</hi> is the halfe of the lesse halfe note) and <hi>ditonus.</hi> But in our
musicke, I can giue no example of it, because we haue no halfe of
a lesse <hi>semitonium,</hi> but those who would shew it, set downe this example. <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>enharmonicum,</hi> and marke the <hi>diesis</hi> thus X as it were the halfe of the
<hi>apotome</hi> or greater halfe note, which is marked thus <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>. This signe of the
more halfe note, we now adaies confound with our <hi>b</hi> square, or signe of <hi>mi</hi> in <hi>b fa ♮ mi,</hi> and with good reason: for when <hi>mi</hi> is sung in <hi>b fa ♮ mi,</hi> it is in that habitude to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamire,</hi>
as the double <hi>diesis</hi> maketh <hi>Ffaut</hi> sharpe to <hi>Elami,</hi> for in both places the distance is a whole
note. But of this enough, and by this which is already set downe, it may euidentlie appeare, that
this kind of musick which is vsual now a daies, is not fully and in euery respect the ancient <hi>Diato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum.</hi>
For if you begin any foure notes, singing <hi>vt re mi fa,</hi> you shal not finde either a flat in <hi>elami,</hi>
or a sharpe in <hi>Ffaut:</hi> so that it must needes follow, that it is neither iust <hi>diatonicum,</hi> nor right <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticum.</hi>
Likewise by that which is saide, it appeareth, this point which our Organists vse
<gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> is not right <hi>Chromatica,</hi> but a bastard point patched vp, of halfe <hi>chroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,</hi>
and halfe <hi>diatonick,</hi> Lastlie it appeareth by that which is said, that
those Virginals which our vnlearned musytians cal <hi>Chromatica</hi> (and some
also <hi>Grammatica)</hi> be not right <hi>chromatica,</hi> but halfe <hi>enharmonica:</hi> &amp; that
al the <hi>chromatica,</hi> may be expressed vppon our common virginals, except
<gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> for if you would thinke that the sharpe in <hi>g sol re ut</hi> would serue that turne, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
you shal find that it is more then halfe a quarter of a note too low. But lett
this suffice for the kinds of musicke: now to the parts Practical. Musicke is duided
into two parts, the first may be called Elementarie or rudimental, teaching to know
the quality and quantity of notes, and euery thing else belonging to songes, of what
maner or kind soeuer. The second may be called <hi>Syntactical, Poetical,</hi> or <hi>effectiue;</hi> treatinge of
soundes, concordes, and discords, and generally of euery thing seruing for the formal and apte set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together of parts or soundes, for producing of harmonie either vpon a ground, or voluntarie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. ad. ver. 27. Which we call the Gam)</hi> That which we cal the scale of musicke, or the <hi>Gam,</hi>
others cal the Scale of <hi>Guido:</hi> for <hi>Guido Aretinus,</hi> a Monke of the order of S. <hi>Benet,</hi> or <hi>Benedict,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the yeare of our Lord 960. changed the Greeke scale (which consisted onely of 15. keyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at <hi>are,</hi> and ending at <hi>alamire)</hi> thinking it a thing too tedious, to saye such long wordes, as
<hi>Proslambanomenos, hypatehypaton,</hi> and such like: turned them into <hi>Are, b mi, c fa ut,</hi> &amp;c. and to the
intent his inuention might the longer remaine and the more easily be learned of children, hee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and applied his Scale to the hand: setting vppon euery ioint a seuerall keye, beginning at the
thumbes ende, and descending on the inside: then orderly through the lowest iointes of euery fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ascending on the little finger, and then vpon the tops of the rest, stil going about, setting his last
key <hi>ela</hi> vpon the vpper iointe of the middle finger on the outside. But to the ende that euerie one
might know from whence he had the Art, he set this Greeke letter Γ <hi>gamma,</hi> to the beginning of his
Scale, seruing for a <hi>diapason</hi> to his seuenth letter <hi>g.</hi> And whereas before him the whole Scale consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
offoure <hi>Tetrachorda</hi> or fourthes, so disposed as the highest note of the lower, was the lowest of
the next, except that of <hi>mese,</hi> as we shal know more largely hereafter, he added a fift <hi>Tetrachordon,</hi>
including in the Scale (but not with such art and reason as the Greekes did) seauen hexachorda or
deductions of his sixe notes, causing that which before contained but fifteene notes, contain twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and so fill vp both the reach of most voices, and the iointes of the hande. Some after him (or
he himselfe) altered his Scale in forme of Organ pipes, as you see set downe in the beginning of the
Booke. But the Greeke Scale was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12119:103"/>
Systema harmonicum quindecim chordarum in genete diatonico.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>For vnderstanding of which, there be three things to be considered: the names, the numbers, and
the distances. As for the names, you must note that they be all Nounes adiectiues, the substantiue
of which is <hi>chorda,</hi> or a string, <hi>Proslabanomene,</hi> signifiesl a string assumed or taken in, the reasonne
whereof we shal straight know.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12119:104"/>
Al the scale was diuided into foure <hi>Tetrashordes</hi> or fourths, the lowest of which foure was called
<hi>Tetrachordon hypaton,</hi> the fourth of principals. The second <hi>tetrachordon meson,</hi> the fourth of middle
or meanes. The third <hi>tetrachordon diezeugmenon,</hi> the fourth of strings disioyned or disiunct. The
fourth and last <hi>tetrachordon hyperbolaeon,</hi> the fourth of stringes exceeding: the lowest string <hi>Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambanomene</hi>
is called assumed, because it is not accounted for one of any <hi>tetrachorde,</hi> but was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in to be a <hi>Diapason</hi> to the <hi>mese</hi> or middle string. The <hi>tetrachorde</hi> of principals or <hi>hypaton,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
in the distance of one note aboue the assumed string, containing foure strings or notes, the
last of which is <hi>Hypatemeson:</hi> the <hi>tetrachorde</hi> of <hi>meson</hi> or meanes, beginneth where the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(so that one string is both the end of the former, and the beginning of the next) and containeth
likewise foure, the last whereof is <hi>mese.</hi> But the third <hi>tetrachorde,</hi> was of two maner of dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
for either it was in the natural kind of singing, and then was it called <hi>tetrachordon diezeugmenon,</hi>
because the middle string or <hi>mese,</hi> was separated from the lowest stringe of that <hi>tetrachorde,</hi> by a
whole note, and was not accounted for any of the foure belonging to it, as you may see in the scale,
or then in the flat kind of singing: in which case, it was called <hi>tetrachordon synezeugmenon,</hi> or <hi>syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi>
because the <hi>mese</hi> was the lowest note of that <hi>tetrachorde,</hi> all being named thus <hi>mese. Trite
synemmenon,</hi> or <hi>synezeugmenon, paranete synezeugmenon,</hi> and <hi>nete synezeugmenon.</hi> But least these
strange names, seeme fitter to coniure a spirite, then to expresse the Art, I haue thought good to
giue the names in English.</p>

            <p>So much for the names. The numbers set on the left side, declare the habitude (which we call pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion)
of one sound to another, as for example: the number set at the lowest note <hi>Proslambano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,</hi>
is <hi>sesqui octaue,</hi> to that which is set before the next: and <hi>sesquitertia</hi> to that which is set at <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanos
hypaton,</hi> &amp; so by consideration of these numbers, may be gathered the distance of the sound
of the one from the other: as <hi>sesqui octaue</hi> produceth one whole note. Then betwixt <hi>Proslambano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,</hi>
and <hi>hypatehypaton,</hi> is the distance of one whole note. Likewise <hi>sesquitertia,</hi> produceth a
fourth: therefore <hi>Proslambanomene</hi> and <hi>Lychanos hypaton</hi> are a fourth, and so of others. But least it
might seeme tedious, to diuide so many numbers, and seeke out the common deuisors for so many
fractions, both the distance is set downe betwixt euerie two notes, and the consonants are drawne
on the right side of the Scale. Thus much for the explanation of the table, but what vse it had, or
how they did sing is vncertaine: onely it appeareth by the names, that they tearmed the keyes of
their scale, after the stringes of some instrument, which I doubt not is the harpe. And though the
Frier <hi>Zaccone</hi> out of <hi>Franchinus</hi> affirme, that the Greekes didde sing by certaine letters, signifying
both the time that the note is to be holden in length, and also the heigth and lownesse of the same:
yet because I finde no such matter in <hi>Franchinus</hi> his <hi>Harmonia instrumentorum</hi> (for his <hi>theorica</hi>
nor <hi>Practica</hi> I haue not seene, nor vnderstand not his arguments) I knowe not what to saie to it.
Yet thus much <hi>I</hi> will saie, that such characters as <hi>Boetius</hi> setteth downe, to signifie the stringes, do
not signifie any time: for it is a great controuersie amongst the learned, if the auncient musytions
had any diuersitie of notes, but onely the signe of the chord being set ouer the word, the quantitie
or length was knowne, by that of the syllable which it serued to expresse. But to returne to <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi>
inuention, it hath hitherto been so vsuall as the olde is gone quite out of mens memorie. And
as for the <hi>Gam,</hi> many haue vpon it deuised such fantastical imaginations, as it were ridiculous to
write, as (forsooth) <hi>Are</hi> is siluer, <hi>B mi</hi> quicksiluer, &amp;c. for it were too long to set downe all. But
it should seeme, that he who wrote it, was either an Alcumiste, or an Alcumistes friend. Before an
old treatise of musicke written in vellim aboue an hundred yeares ago, called <hi>Regulae Franchonis cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

by the note, in b fa <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g> mi, hauing the halfe note either aboue or belowe it, &amp; it may plainly be seen, that those three
properties haue not byn deuised for prickt song; for you shal find no long inclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded in so smal bounds as to touche no b.
And therefore these plainsongs which were so contained, were called naturall, because euery key of their six notes stood
inuariable the one to the other, howsoeuer the notes were named. As from d sol re, to e la mi, was alwaies a vvhole
note, whether one did sing sol la, or re mi, and so forth of others. If the b. had the semitonium vnder it, then was it noted b. &amp; vvas
termed b. <hi>molle,</hi> or soft; if aboue it, then was it noted thus ♮ and termed b. <hi>quaratum</hi> or b. <hi>quarre.</hi> In an olde treatise called <hi>Tractatus
quatuor principalium,</hi> I find these rules and verses, <hi>Omne vt incipiens in c. cantatur per naturam. in</hi> F. <hi>per b. molle, in g. per</hi> ♮ <hi>quadratum.</hi>
that is, Euery vt beginning in C. is sung by properchant in F. by b. <hi>molle</hi> or flat, in g. by the square ♮ or sharpe, the verses be these

Which if they were no truer in substance then they be fine in words and right in quantitie of syllables, were not much worth. As for
the three themselues, their names beare manifest witnes, that musicke hath come to vs from the French. For if we had had it from
any other, I see no reason why we might not aswel haue said the square b. as b. <hi>quarre</hi> or <hi>carre,</hi> the signification beeing alone. In the
treatise of the foure principals I found a table, containing all the notes in the scale; and by what propertie of singing euery one is
sung, which I thought good to communicate vnto thee in English.</p>

But for the vnderstanding of it, I must shew you what is meant by mutation or change. Mutation
is the leauing of one name of a note and taking another in the same sound, and is done (sayeth the
Author of <hi>quatuor principalia)</hi> either by reason of propertie, or by reason of the voice. By reason of
the property, as when you change the sol in <hi>g sol re ut,</hi> in ut, by the ♮ and in re by the ♭. &amp; such like,
by reason of the voice when the name is changed, for the ascension or descensions sake: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
in <hi>c fa ut,</hi> if you take the note fa, you may rise to the third, and fall to the fourth, in the due
order of the six notes, if the property let not. But if you would ascend to the fourth, then of force
must you change your fa, into vt, if you will not sing improperlie, because no man can ascende a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
la, nor descend vnder vt properlie: for if he descend, he must call vt, fa. Now in those keyes
wherein there is but one note, there is no change, where two, there is double change, where three
is <hi>sextupla:</hi> but al this must be vnderstood where those three or two notes be all in one sounde, for
if they be not of one sound, they fall not vnder this rule, for they be directed by signes set by them.
But all mutation ending in <hi>vt re mi,</hi> is called ascending, because they may ascend further then des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
and all change ending in <hi>fa sol la,</hi> is called descending, because they may descend further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ascend, and thereof came this verse: <hi>vt re mi scandunt, descendunt fa quoque sol la.</hi> But though, as
I said, these three properties be found in plainsong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in pricktsong they be but two: that is, either
sharp or flat, for where nature is, there no ♭. is touched. But if you would knowe whereby any note
singeth (that is whether it sing by properchant ♮ <hi>quarre,</hi> or <hi>b. molle,</hi> name the note and so come
downeward to vt: example, you woulde knowe wherby sol in <hi>g sol re ut</hi> singeth, come down thus,
<hi>sol fa mi re vt,</hi> so you find vt in <hi>c fa ut,</hi> which is the propertie whereby the sol in <hi>g sol re ut</hi> singeth,
and so by others.</p>

               <hi>Page 9. verse 18. By the forme of the note)</hi> There were in old time foure maners of pricking, one al
blacke which they tearmed blacke full, another which we vse now which they called black void,
the third all red, which they called red ful, the fourth red as ours is blacke, which they called redde
void: al which you may perceiue thus: <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap>
But if a white note (which they called
black voide (happened amongste
blacke full, it was diminished
of halfe the value, so that a minime was but a crotchet, and a samibriefe a minime, &amp;c. If a redde
full note were found in blacke pricking, it was diminished of a fourth part, so that a semibriefe was
but three crotchettes and a Redde minime was but a Crotchette: and thus you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
that they vsed their red pricking in al respects as we vse our blacke noweadaies. But that
order of pricking is gone out of vse now, so that wee vse the blacke voides, as they vsed their black
fulles, and the blacke fulles as they vsed the redde fulles. The redde is gone almost quite out of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
so that none vse it, and fewe knowe what it meaneth. Nor doe we pricke anye blacke notes
amongst white, except a semibriefe thus: <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> in which case, the semibriefe so blacke
is a minime and a pricke (though some would haue it sung in tripla maner, and
stand for 2<hi rend="sub">3</hi> of a semibriefe) and the black minime a Crotchet, as indeede it is. If
more blacke semibriefes or briefes bee to gither; then is there some proportion,
&amp; most commonly either <hi>tripla</hi> or <hi>hemiolia,</hi> which is nothing but a rounde
common <hi>tripla</hi> or <hi>sesquialtera.</hi> As for the number of the formes of notes, there were within these
two hundred yeares but foure, knowne or vsed of the Musytions: those were the Longe, Briefe,
Semibriefe, and Minime. The Minime they esteemed the least or shortest note singable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
indiuisible. Their long was in three maners: that is, either simple, double, or triple: a simple
Long was a square forme, hauing a taile on the right side hanging downe or ascending: a double
Long was so formed as some at this daie frame their Larges, that is, as it were compact of 2. longs:
the triple was bigger in quantitie than the double. Of their value we shal speake hereafter. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mibriefe
was at the first framed like a triangle thus <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
               </gap> as it were the halfe of a briefe diuided by a

                  <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
               </gap> but that figure not being comly nor easie to make, it grew afterward to the figure
of a rombe or loseng thus <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
               </gap> which forme it still retaineth.</p>
            <p>The minime was formed as it is now, but the taile of it they euer made ascending, and called it
<hi>Signum minimitatis</hi> in their <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Latine. The inuention of the minime they ascribe to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
priest (or who he was I know not) in <hi>Nauarre,</hi> or what contrie else it was which they tearmed
<hi>Nauernia,</hi> but the first who vsed it, was one <hi>Philippus de vitriaco,</hi> whose <hi>motetes</hi> for some time were
of al others best esteemed and most vsed in the Church. Who inuented the Crotchet, Quauer, and
Semiquauer is vncertaine. Some attribute the inuention of the Crotchet to the aforenamed <hi>Philip,</hi>
but it is not to be founde in his workes, and before the saide <hi>Philippe,</hi> the smallest note vsed was a
semibriefe, which the Authors of that time made of two sortes more or lesse: for one <hi>Francho</hi> diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the briefe, either in three equal partes (terming them <hi>semibriefes)</hi> or in two vnequal parts, the
greater whereof was called the more <hi>semibriefe</hi> (and was in value equal to the vnperfect briefe) the
other was called the lesse <hi>semibriefe,</hi> as being but halfe of the other aforesaid.
This <hi>Francho</hi> is the most ancient of al those whose workes of practical musicke haue come to my

               <hi>Pag. ead. verse ead. and the mood)</hi> By the name of <hi>Mood</hi> were signified many thinges in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
First those which the learned call <hi>moodes,</hi> which afterward were tearmed by the name of
<hi>tunes.</hi> Secondly a certaine forme of disposition of the Church plainsongs in <hi>longes</hi> and <hi>Breues</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
If a plainsong consisted al of Longes, it was called the first mood: if of a Long &amp; a Briefe
successiuely, it was called the second mood, &amp;c. Thirdly, for one of the degrees of musick, as when
we saie mood, is the dimension of Larges and Longes. And lastly, for al the degrees of Musicke, in
which sence it is commonlie (though falsly) taught to all the young Schollers in Musicke of our
time: for those signes which we vse, do not signifie any moode at all, but stretche no further then
time, so that more properly they might cal them time perfect of the more prolation, &amp;c. then <hi>mood</hi>
perfect of the more prolation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page ead. verse 22. The restes)</hi> Restes are of two kindes, that is: either to be told, or not to bee
tolde, those which are not to be told be alwaies sette before the song (for what purpose wee shall
know hereafter) those which are to be told for two causes cheefly were inuented. First, to giue som
leasure to the singers to take breath. The second, that the pointes might follow in Fuge one vpon
another, at the more ease, and to shew the singer how farre he might let the other goe before him
before he began to follow. Some restes also (as the minime and crotchet restes) were deuised, to
auoid the harshnesse of some discord, or the following of two perfect concords together.</p>
            <p>But it is to be noted, that the long rest was not alwaies of one forme: for when the long contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
three Briefes, then did the Long rest reach ouer three spaces, but when the Long was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
then the Long rest reached but ouer two spaces as they now vse them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag ead. vers. 25. Ligatures)</hi> Ligatures were deuised for the Ditties sake, so that how manye
notes serued for one syllable, so many notes were tied togither. Afterwards they were vsed in songs
hauing no dittie, but only for breuitie of writing: but nowadaies our songes consisting of so small
notes, few Ligatures be therein vsed: for <hi>minimes,</hi> and figures in time shorter than <hi>minimes</hi> cannot
be tied or enter in ligature. But that defect might be supplyed by dashing the signe of the degree
either with one stroke, or two, and so cause the Ligable figures serue to any smal quantitie of time
we lift. But because in the booke <hi>I</hi> haue spoken nothing of black or halfe black ligatures, I thoght
it not amisse, to set downe such as I haue found vsed by other Authors, and collected by Frier <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eone,</hi>

it superfluous to set downe any more, though infinite more might be found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 12. verse 6. Pricks)</hi> A pricke is a kinde of Ligature, so that if you would tie a semibrief
and a minime together, you may set a pricke after the semibriefe, and so you shal binde them. But
it is to be vnderstood, that it must be done in notes standing both in one key, else wil not the prick
augment the value of the note set before it, But if you would tie a semibriefe and a minime, or two
minimes together, which stand not both in one key, then must you vse the forme of some note li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
(for as I tolde you before, the minime and smaller figures then it bee not ligable) and marke
the signe of degree, with what diminution is fittest for your purpose, example. There bee two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes,
the one standing in <hi>Alamire,</hi> the other in <hi>elams:</hi> if you must needs haue them sung for one
syllable, or be tied together, then may you set them downe thus <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> as though they wer
semibriefes, but dashing the signe of the time with a stroake of diminution to make
them minimes. But if you thinke that would not be perceiued, then may you sette
downe numbers before them thus 2<hi rend="sub">1</hi> which would haue the same effect: but if that
pleased you no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other then might you set them in tied briefes with this 𝇍 or this 4<hi rend="sub">1</hi>
signe before them, which were all one matter with the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page ead. verse 8. A pricke of augmentation.)</hi> Some tearme it a pricke of addition, some also a
pricke of perfection, not much amisse: but that which now is called of our musicians a prick of per
section, is altogither superfluous and of no vse in musicke: for after a semibriefe in the more prola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they set a pricke, though another semibriefe follow it: but though the pricke were away, the
semibriefe of it selfe is perfect. The Author of the Treatise <hi>De quatuor principalibus,</hi> saieth thus.
<q>Take it for certaine, that the point or pricke is set in pricksong for two causes, that is, either for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section
or diuisions sake, although some haue falsly put the point for other causes, that is, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
and alterations sake, which is an absurdity to speake. But the pricke following a note,
will make it perfect, though of the owne nature it be vnperfect. Also the point is putte to deuide,
when by it the perfections <hi>(so hee tearmeth the number of three)</hi> be distinguished, and for any other
cause the point in musicke is not set downe.</q>
So that by these his wordes it euidentlie appeareth,
that in those daies (that is about twoe hundred yeares agoe) musicke was not so farre degenerate
from theoricall reasons as it is now. But those who came after, not only made foure kinds of pricks,
but also added the fist, thus. There bee say they in all fiue kindes of pricks, a pricke of addition, a
pricke of augmentation, a pricke of perfection, a pricke of deuision, and a pricke of alteration. A
pricke of augmentation they define, that which being sette after a note, maketh it halfe as muche
longer as it was before: the pricke of Addition they define, that which being set after a sembriefe
in the more prolation, if a minime follow, it causeth the semibriefe to be three white minimes. A
pricke of perfection they define, that which being set after a semibriefe in the more prolation, if an
other semibriefe follow, it causeth the first to be perfect. The pricke of deuision and alteration they
define, as they be in my booke. But if we consider rightly both the pricke of Addition, of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation,
and that of alteration, are conteined vnder that of perfection: for in the lesse prolation
when a semibriefe is two minimes, if it haue a pricke and be three, then must it bee perfect: and in
the more prolation, when two minimes come betwixt two semibriefes, or in time perfect, when
two semibriefes come betwixt two briefes which be perfect, the last of the two minimes is marked
with a pricke, and so is altered to the time of two minimes: and the laste of the twoe semibriefes is
likewise marked with a pricke, and is sung in the time of two semibriefes, which is onely done for
perfections sake, that the ternary number may be obserued: yet in such cases of alteration, som cal
that a point of diuision. For if you diuide the last semibriefe in time perfect from the briefe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either must you make it two semibriefes, or then perfection decaies: so that the point of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
may either be tearmed a point of perfection, or of diuision. But others whoe woulde seeme
very expert in musicke, haue set downe the points or pricks thus: this pricke (say they) dooth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
𝇋 𝆸. Now this pricke standing in this place 𝇈. 𝆸 doeth imperfect. Nowe the pricke stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in this place 𝇈 𝆷<hi rend="sup">.</hi> takes away the third part, and another pricke which standeth
vnder the note takes away the one halfe, as heere 𝆷<hi rend="sub">.</hi> and like in all notes. But to refute this
mans opinion (for what or who he is I know not) I need no more then his owne words, for (saith
he) if the pricke stand thus 𝇈. 𝆸 it imperfecteth, if thus 𝇈 𝆷<hi rend="sup">.</hi> it taketh away the third part of the
value. Nowe I praye him, what difference he maketh betwixt taking away the third
part of the value and imperfection? If he say (as he must needes say) that taking awaye the thirde
part of the value is to make vnperfect, then I say he hath done amisse, to make one point of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and another of taking away the third part of a notes value.</p>
            <p>Againe, allimperfection is made either by a note reste or cullor, but no imperfection is made by
a pricke, therefore our Monke (or whatsoeuer he were) hath erred, in making a point of imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And lastly, all diminution is signified, either by the dashing of the signe of the degree, or by
proportionate numbers, or by a number sette to the signe, or else by asscription of the Canon: but
none of these is a pricke, therefore no diminution (for taking away halfe of the note is diminution)
<pb facs="tcp:12119:107"/>
is signified by a pricke, and therefore none of his rules be true sauing the first, which is, that a prick
following a blacke briefe perfecteth it.</p>

               <hi>Pag. ead. vers. 16. those who)</hi> that is, <hi>Franchinus Ganforus, Peter Aron, Glareanus,</hi> and at a word
all who euer wrote of the Art of Musicke. And though they all agree in the number and forme of
degrees, yet shall you hardly finde two of them tell one tale for the signes to know them. For time
and prolation there is no controuersie, the difficultie resteth in the moodes. But to the ende that
you may the more easilie vnderstand their nature, I haue collected such rules as were requisite for
that purpose, and yet could not so well be handled in the booke. The mood therefore was signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
two maner of waies, one by numerall figures, another by pauses or restes. That way by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
I haue handled in my booke, it resteth to set downe that way of shewing the mood by pauses.
When they would signifie the great mood perfect, they did set downe three long restes together.
If the lesse mood were likewise perfect, then did euery one of those long restes take vp three spaces
thus <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> but if the great mood were perfect, and the lesse mood vnperfect, then did they like
wise set downe three long Restes, but vnperfect in this maner, and though this way
bee agreeable both to experience and reason, yet hath <hi>Franchinus</hi> 
               <gap reason="music">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Ganforus</hi> sette
downe the signe of the great mood perfect thus, <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> of the great moode vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
he setteth no sign, except one would say that this is it <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap>
for when he sets downe that mood, there is such a dashe before it, touching all the fiue
lines. But one may iustlye doubt if that bee the signe of the mood, or some stroke set at
the beginning of the lines. But that signe which he maketh of the great moode perfect, that
doth <hi>Peter Aron</hi> set for the great mood imperfect, if the lesse mood be perfect But (saith he) This
is not of necessity, but according as the composition shall fal to be, the lesse mood perfect not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ioyned with the great mood imperfect. So that when both moodes be imperfect, then is the
signe thus <gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap> And thus much for the great mood. The lesse moode is often considered and the
great left out, in which case if the smal mood be perfect it is signified thus <gap reason="music">

            <p>But by the way you must note, that in all Moodes (or rather signes) of the more prolation, he setteth
a minime for a whole stroke, and proueth it by examples out of the masse of <hi>Palestin,</hi> called <hi>l'home
armè.</hi> There is also another way of setting downe the degrees, which because I had not seen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by any Musition, I was determined to haue passed in silence. But because some of my friends
affirmed to me, that they had seen them so set down, I thought it best to shew the meaning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The auncient Musytians, who grounded all their practise vpon Speculation, did commonlie sette
downe a particular signe for euery degree of musycke in the song: so that they hauing no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
then three, that is, the two moods &amp; time (prolation not being yet inuented) set down three
signes for them, so that if the great moode were perfect, it was signified by a whole circle, which
is a perfect figure: if it were imperfect, it was marked with a halfe circle, Therefore, wheresoeuer
these signes 𝇇3 were set before any songe, there was the greate moode perfect signified by the
circle. The small mood perfect signified by the first figure of three, and time perfect signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the last figure of three. If the song were marked thus 𝇋33, then was the great mood vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and the smal mood and time perfect. But if the first figure were a figure of two thus 𝇋23, then
were both moods vnperfect and time perfect: but if it were thus 𝇋22, then were all vnperfect.
<pb facs="tcp:12119:108"/>
But if in al the song there were no Large, then did they set downe the signes of such notes as were
in the song: so that if the circle or semicircle were set before one onelie cifer, as 𝇈2 then did it
signifie the lesse mood, and by that reason that circle now last sette downe with the binarie
cipher following it, signified the lesse mood perfect, and time vnperfect. If thus 𝇊3 then was the
lesse mood vnperfect and time perfect. If thus 𝇋2. then was both the lesse mood and time vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and so of others. But since the prolation was inuented, they haue set a pointe in the circle or
halfe circle, to shew the more prolation, which notwithstanding altereth nothing in the mood nor
time. But because (as <hi>Peter Aron</hi> saith) these are little vsed now at this present, I will speake no
more of it, for this wil suffice for the vnderstanding of any song which shal be so markt: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

the first three, and the latter sixe, and that comparison and as it were respect of the one vnto the
other, is that <hi>ratio</hi> &amp; <hi>habitudo</hi> which wee spake of. Now these things which are compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

comprehendeth the lesse more then once, and besides some one part of it, as 9 to 4, is <hi>dupla sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarta,</hi>
because it containeth it twise. And moreouer, one fourth part of it. Likewise 7 is to 2. <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla
sesqui altera,</hi> that is <hi>multiplex,</hi> because it containeth 2 of ten, that is thrice: and <hi>superparticular,</hi>
because it hath also a halfe of two: that is one, and so of others: for of this kind there be as manye
formes as of the simple kindes <hi>multiplex</hi> and <hi>superparticular. Multiplex superpartiens,</hi> is easily
knowne by the name, example 14 to 5. is <hi>multiplex superpartiens. Multiplex,</hi> because it contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
5 twise, and <hi>superpartiens,</hi> because it hath foure sift parts more, and so 14 to 5 is <hi>dupla superqua
dispartiens quint as,</hi> for of this kind there be so many formes as of <hi>multiplex</hi> and <hi>superpartiens.</hi> Thus
you see that two termes compared togither, containe <hi>ratio, habitudo respecte,</hi> or howe else you liste
to terme it. But if the termes be more then two, and betwixt them one respect or more, then doe
the Greekes by the same word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the Latines call it <hi>Proportio,</hi> and define
<pb facs="tcp:12119:108"/>
it thus, <hi>Proportio est rationum similitudo.</hi> And <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the fift booke of his Morals. <hi>ad Nicomachum,</hi>
defineth it <hi>Rationum aequalitas,</hi> as for example. Let there be three numbers, whereof the first hath double
respect to the second, &amp; the second double respect to the third thus, 12, 6, 3. these or any such like make
proportion or <hi>Analogie.</hi> The Arithmeticians set downe in their bookes many kinds of proportions, but
we wil touch but those three which are so common euerye where in the workes of those chiefe Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and be these, <hi>Geometrical, Arithmetical,</hi> and <hi>Harmonical. Geometricall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
(which properly is proportion) is that which two or more aequal <hi>habitudes</hi> do make, as I shewed
you euen now, and is either <hi>coniunct</hi> or <hi>disiunct. Coniunct</hi> proportion, is when the middle tearme is twice
taken thus, as 16 to 8, so are 8 to 4, and 4 to 2, and 2 to 1, for here is euery where double habitude, <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct</hi>
proportion, is when the middle termes bee but once taken thus, as 16 to 8, so 6 to 3. Arithmeticall
proportion, is when between twoe or more termes is the same, not habitude but difference, as it is in the
natural disposition of numbers thus, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: for here euery tearme passeth other, by one only, or thus,
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, where euery number passeth other, by two, or any such like. But <hi>Harmonical</hi> proportion
is that, which neither is made of aequal <hi>habitudes,</hi> nor of the like differences: but when the greatest of three
termes is so to the least as the differences of the greatest and middle termes, is to the difference of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
and least example. Here be three numbers 6 4 3. whereof the first twoe are in <hi>sesquialtera</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude,
and the latter two are in <hi>sesquitertia:</hi> you see here is neither like habitude, nor the same differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for foure is more then three by one, and six is more then four by two: but take the difference betwixt
six and foure, which is two, and the difference of 4 and 3. which is 1, and compare the differences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you shal find two to 1, as 6 is to 3, that is <hi>dupla</hi> habitude. And this is called <hi>harmonical</hi> proportion,
because it containeth the habitudes of the Consonantes amongest themselues: as, Let there bee three
lines taken for as many stringes or Organ-pipes, let the first be six foot long, the second foure, the thirde
three: that of sixe wil be a <hi>diapason</hi> or eight to that of three, and that of four wil be a <hi>diapente</hi> or fift aboue
that of sixe, thus:</p>
            <p>
               <figure/>
Thus you see what proportion is, and
that proportion is not properlie taken
in that sence wherein it is vsed in the
booke: yet was I constrained to vse that
word for lacke of a better. One whose
booke came lately from the presse, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Pathwaie to Musicke,</hi> setting
downe the proportions, calleth them a
great proportion of inequality, &amp; a lesse
proportion of inequalitie: and a little
after treating of <hi>dupla,</hi> he setteth down
words which hee hath translated out of
<hi>Lossius</hi> his Musicke, but it seemeth hee
hath not vnderstood too well, for (saith
he) <hi>dupla</hi> is that which taketh from all
notes and rests the halfe value, &amp;c. and
giueth this example:

<gap reason="music">

               </gap> example, or else
he hath not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
or a crotchet
is. But if I might, I would aske him of what length he maketh euery note of the plainsong? I knowe hee
will answer of a semibriefe timeh. Then if your plainsong be of a semibriefe time, how will two minimes
being diminished, make vp the time of a whole semibriefe? A minime in <hi>dupla</hi> proportion beeing but a
<pb facs="tcp:12119:109"/>
Crotchet. O but (saith he) the plainsong note is likewise diminished, and so the diminished minims wil
make vp the time of a diminished semibriefe. But then how wil one barre of your partition make vppe a
full stroke? seeing in the lesse prolation a minime is neuer taken for a whole stroke. Againe, no diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is euer knowne, but where the signes of diminution be set by the notes, and except you sette the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in both partes, diminution wil not be in both parts. But to conclude, he who set downe that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
either knew not what <hi>dupla</hi> was, or then vnderstood not what he himselfe said, which appeareth in
many other places of his booke: as for example, in the tenth page (leauing out the leafe of the title) <hi>A
perfect sound</hi> (saith he) <hi>containeth a distance of two perfect soundes.</hi> What would he say by this? in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
he would say <hi>A perfect second containeth a distance of two perfect soundes.</hi> Yet I know not what he
meaneth by <hi>a perfect sound:</hi> for any sound is perfect not compared to another, and though it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to another, yet is the sound perfect, though it be not a perfect consonant to the other. But our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
who shewes such <hi>Pathwaies to Musicke,</hi> would say this, <hi>A perfect second conteineth a whole note</hi> (or as
the Latines tearme it <hi>integer tonus) as from vt tore, is a whole note, &amp;c.</hi> In the beginning of the next page,
he saith, <hi>An vnperfect second a sound and a halfe:</hi> but I pray you good M. <hi>Guide of the Pathway,</hi> howe can
you make that a sound (for so you interpret the word <hi>tonus)</hi> and a halfe, which is not full a halfe sound or
halfe a <hi>tonus?</hi> But if you had vnderstood what you saide, you would haue said thus: <hi>An vnperfect seconde
conteineth but a lesse halfe note, as is euer betwixt mi and fa.</hi> Also defining what <hi>diatessaron,</hi> or a fourth is,
he saith, <hi>a fourth is the distance of the voice by a fourth.</hi> And likewise, <hi>a fift the distance of the voice by a fift.</hi>
Notable definitions: as in the play, the page asking his maister what a <hi>Poet</hi> was, he, after a great pause &amp;
long studie, answered that it was a Poet. Likewise, giuing the definition of a note, he saith <hi>it is a signe she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
the lowdnesse or stilnesse of the voice,</hi> but these be light faultes to those which follow after. For the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures
are set downe false, and comming to speake of the Moodes, or degrees of musicke, he maketh no
mention at all of the <hi>lesse mood.</hi> And defining time he saith, <hi>it is a formall quantity of semibriefes measuring
them by three or by two:</hi> and prolation he calleth <hi>a formall quantity of minimes and semibriefes,</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
time perfect of the lesse prolation, he setteth it downe thus.
<gap reason="music">
                  <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
               </gap>

the example still importing the contrary to that which was said in the definition. But this is the Worlde.
Euery one will take vpon him to write, and teach others, none hauing more need of teaching then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And as for him of whom we haue spoken so much, one part of his booke he stole out of <hi>Beurhusius,</hi>
another out of <hi>Lossius,</hi> peruerting the sence of <hi>Lossius</hi> his wordes, and giuing examples flatte to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

which is in the time vnperfect of the lesse prolation <hi>dupla,</hi> or that it is in <hi>dupla</hi> proportion, except they
would say, that any two to one is <hi>dupla:</hi> which none (at least who is in his right wits) will affirme. For
when proportion is, then must the things compared be of one kind: as one aker to two akers is in <hi>subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla</hi>
proportion, &amp;c. So when you see <hi>dupla</hi> set downe, you must sing euery note so faste againe as it was
before. <hi>Glareanus</hi> giueth this example of <hi>dupla</hi> out of <hi>Franchinus,</hi> which because it hath some difficulty,
I thought good to set downe and explaine in this place.

The signe at the beginning sheweth time perfect, so that euery briefe not hauing a semibriefe after it is
three semibriefes, and so being diminished of halfe their value in <hi>dupla</hi> proportion, are but three minimes
a peece: those briefes which in <hi>dupla</hi> haue a semibrife following them, are sung but in time of one semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briefe,
the signe of imperfect time comming in after the proportion destroyeth it, but these numbers 4<hi rend="sub">2</hi>
being the notes of <hi>dupla</hi> habitude, following within foure notes, make vp the proportion againe: but
in the latter <hi>dupla,</hi> you must marke that the diminished briefe is lesse by a whole minime then it was in the
former, because the first followed time perfect, and the halfe of a briefe in time perfect, is three minimes,
the latter followed time imperfect, and the halfe of a briefe in time vnperfect, is a semibriefe or twoe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes.
Likewise you must note, that when <hi>dupla</hi> or any, other proportion is in all the partes alike, then

kindes as there be maners of pricking, sometimes al in blacke notes, sometimes all in white notes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mingled, sometimes in briefes, sometimes al in semibriefes, and yet all one measure. But one thing
I mislike (though it be in common vse with vs all) that is, when wee call that <hi>tripla</hi> wherein al the voices
goe together in one time with the stroke of <hi>sesquialtera</hi> time, or three minimes for a stroke, for that is no
<hi>tripla,</hi> but as it were a <hi>sesquialtera</hi> compared to a <hi>sesquialtera:</hi> and whereas wee commonly make <hi>tripla</hi>
with three minimes for a stroke, we confound it with <hi>sesquialtera.</hi> Lastly, true <hi>tripla</hi> maketh three Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briefes
or their value in other notes to the time of one semibriefe, whereof <hi>Glareanus</hi> giueth this example
out of <hi>Coclaeus.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>tripla</hi> is double as swift in stroke as our common <hi>tripla</hi> of three minims, which though I haue vsed
and stil doe vse, yet am not I able to defend it by reason: so that if any man would change before mee, I
would likewise willingly change, but of my selfe I am loth to breake a receiued custome. But one may
aske me, if our common <hi>tripla</hi> be not a proportion, what it is? I will answere out of <hi>Glareanus,</hi> that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be a kind of perfection flourished by Art, and different from the auncient and first kind of order,
because in it, both imperfection and alteration haue place. And by this, which in <hi>dupla</hi> and <hi>tripla</hi> is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
may all other things concerning proportions of <hi>multiplicity</hi> be easily vnderstoode, therfore one word
of <hi>sesqui altera,</hi> and then an ende of this first part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 31. verse 9. Sesquialtera) Sesquialtera,</hi> is a musical proportion, wherin three notes are sung in the
time of two of the same kinde, or rather thus. <hi>Sesquialtera,</hi> is a kinde of musicall diminution, wherein 3.
semibriefes or their value in other notes are sung for two strokes. But you may obiect and say, If that be
true <hi>sesquialtera,</hi> what difference do you make betwixt it and the more prolation? Only this, that in the
more prolation, a perfect semibriefe maketh vppe a whole stroke and likewise the value of a semibriefe:
but in <hi>sesquialtera,</hi> the value of a semibriefe and a halfe doe but make one stroke, and a semibriefe of it
selfe neuer maketh a stroke. And by this it appeareth, that our common <hi>tripla</hi> of three minimes is false,
which is confounded both with the more prolation and <hi>sesquialtera.</hi> Therefore take that for a sure and
infallible rule which I haue set down in my book, that <hi>in all musical proportions the vpper number signifieth
the semibriefe, and the lower the stroke,</hi> so that if the proportion be noted thus 3<hi rend="sub">2</hi> three semibriefes or the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of three semibriefes must go to two strokes, but if thus 2<hi rend="sub">3</hi> then must tvvoe semibriefes or their value
make three whole strokes. And let this suffice for the pro portions. As for <hi>Sesquitertia, sesquiquarta</hi> and
such like, it were folly to make many wordes of them, seeing they be altogether out of vse, and it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
almost impossible to make sweet musicke in that kind. Yet is <hi>sesquitertia</hi> one of the hardest proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which can be vsed, and carieth much more difficulty then <hi>sesquiquarta,</hi> because it is easier to diuide a
semibriefe into foure aequal parts, then into three: nor haue I euer seene an example of true <hi>sesquitertia</hi>
sauing one, which <hi>Lossius</hi> giueth for an example, and pricketh it in Longs, making them but three stroks
a peece, and the briefes one and a halfe: in semibriefes it is very hard, and almost impossible to vse it, but
according to our manner of singing, if one part sing <hi>sesquialtera</hi> in Crotchets, and another sing Quauers
in the lesse prolation, whereof eight go to a stroke, then would we say that that were eight to sixe, which
is <hi>sesquitertia.</hi>

who knew not how to employ my time, and therefore I wil conclude with one worde, that proportions

and <hi>superpartients</hi> carry great difficultie, and haue crept into musick I know not how, but it shold
seeme, that it was by meanes of the <hi>Descantors,</hi> who striuing to sing harder waies vpon a plainsong then
their fellowes, brought in that which neither could please the eares of other men, nor could by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
be defended by reason. Here was I determined to haue made an ende, but some more curious then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
compelled me to speake some words more, and to giue a reason why, after the proportions <hi>I</hi> haue
saide nothing of the <hi>inductions.</hi> And therefore to be briefe, I say that all which they can say of these <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
is nothing but meere foolishnesse, <hi>&amp; commenta otiosorum hominum qui nihil aliud agunt nisi ut iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niant
quomodo in otio negotiosi videantur.</hi> Yet I maruel, that a thinge which neither is of any vse, nor yet
can be prooued by any reason, should so much be stood vpon by them, who take vpon them to teach the
youth nowadaies. But yet to refute it I need no other argument then this, that not any one of them who
teach it, deliuereth it as another doth. But to be plaine, those <hi>inductions</hi> be no other thinge (as I saide in
my booke, <hi>pag. 92. ver. 7)</hi> but that number which any greater notes broken in smaller do make, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
(though their opinions be false) <hi>sesquialtera</hi> or pricke semibriefe is the induction to their <hi>tripla,</hi>
for sing your <hi>sesquialtera</hi> in minimes, and you shall find three of them to a stroke. Likewise, breake ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your <hi>tripla</hi> of three minimes or your pricke semibriefe into crotchets, and so shall the prick semibrief
bee the induction to <hi>sextupla</hi> as they say, but this is so false as what is falsest: for in whatsoeuer notes you
sing <hi>sesquialtera,</hi> it is alwaies <hi>sesquialtera,</hi> because the value of a semibriefe and a halfe doth alwaies make
a full stroke. Breake true <hi>tripla</hi> in minimes it will make their <hi>sextupla,</hi> make it in crotchets, it will make
their <hi>duodecupla,</hi> and this is it which they call their inductions, which it shal be enough for the scholler to
vnderstand when he heareth them named: for no musician (if he can but breake a note) can misse the true
vse of them. It resteth now to giue a reason why I haue placed that table of proportions in my book, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it belongeth no more to musicke, then any other part of Arithmeticke doth (Arithmeticke you must
not take here in that sence as it is commonly for the Art of calculation, but as it is taken by <hi>Euclide, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comachus,
Boetius</hi> and others) but the reason why I set it there, was to helpe the vnderstanding of manye
young practicioners, who (though they see a song marked with numbers, as thus for example) yet doe
they not know what proportion that is. And therefore if they doe but look vpon 3 the numbers, &amp; marke
the concourse of the lines in closing them, they shall there plainly finde set downe, what relation one of
those numbers hath to another.</p>

which may be properly tearmed <hi>syntactical, poeticall, or effectiue:</hi> and thoughe I dare not affirme
that this part was in vse with the musicians of the learned age of <hi>Ptolomaus,</hi> or yet of that of <hi>Boetius:</hi> yet
may I with some reason say, that it is more auncient then pricksong, and only by reason of the name which
is <hi>contrapunto</hi> an Italian word deuised since the <hi>Gothes</hi> did ouerrun <hi>Italy,</hi> and changed the Latine tounge
into that barbarisme which they now vse. As for the word it selfe, it was at that time fit enough to expres
the thing signified, because no diuersity of notes being vsed, the musicians in stead of notes did set downe
their musicke in plaine prickes or pointes: but afterwards that custome being altered by the diuersity of
formes of notes, yet the name is retained amongst them in the former signification, though amongst vs it
be restrained from the generality, to signifie that species or kind, which of all others is the most simple &amp;
plaine, and in stead of it we haue vsurped the name of <hi>descant.</hi> Also by continuance of time, that name
is also degenerated into another signification, and for it we vse the word <hi>setting</hi> or <hi>composing.</hi> But to leaue
<hi>setting</hi> and <hi>composing,</hi> and come to the matter which now we are to intreat of, the word <hi>descant</hi> signifieth
in our toung, the forme of setting together of sundry voices or concords for producing of harmony: and a
musician if he heare a song sung and mislike it, he will saie the <hi>Descant</hi> is naught. But in this signification
it is seldome vsed, and the most common signification which it hath, is the singing <hi>ex tempore</hi> vpon a plain
song: in which sence there is none (who hath tasted the first elements of musicke) but vnderstandeth it.
When descant did begin, by whom and where it was inuented is vncertaine, for it is a great controuersie
amongst the learned if it were knowne to the antiquitie, or no. And diuers do bring arguments to proue,
and others to disproue the antiquity of it: and for disprouing of it, they say that in all the workes of them,
who haue written of musicke before <hi>Franchinus,</hi> there is no mention of any more parts then one, and that
if any did sing to the harpe (which was their most vsuall instrument) they sung the same which they plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But those who would affirme that the auncients knew it, saie: That if they did not know it, to what
ende serued all those long and tedious discourses and disputations of the consonantes wherein the moste
part of their workes are consumed? But whether they knew it or not, this I wil say, that they had it not in
halfe that variety wherein we now haue it, though we read of much more strange effects of their musick
then of ours.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:12119:111"/>
the sence will be perfect. As for the Consonants or concordes, I doe not thinke that anye of those which
wee call vnperfect cords, were either in vse or acknowledged for Consonants, in the time of those whoe
professed musicke before <hi>Guido Aretinus,</hi> or of <hi>Guido</hi> himselfe. <hi>Boethius</hi> setting downe the harmonicall
proportions and the Consonants which arise of them, talketh of <hi>quadrupla, tripla, dupla, sesquialtera,</hi> and
<hi>sesquitertia,</hi> which make <hi>disdiapason, diapente cum diapason, diapason, diapente,</hi> and <hi>diatessaron,</hi> or as we say,
a <hi>fifteenth,</hi> a <hi>twelfe,</hi> an <hi>eight,</hi> a <hi>fift,</hi> &amp; a <hi>fourth.</hi> But why they should make <hi>diatessaron</hi> a Consonant, seeing it
mightily offendeth the eare, I see no reason, except they woulde make that Geometricall rule of <hi>paralell</hi>
lines true in consonants of musicke: <hi>Quae sunt vni &amp; eidem parallelae, sunt etiam inter se parallelae,</hi> &amp; so make
those fouds which to one and the selfesame are consonants, to be likewise consonantes amongste them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
But if any man would aske me a reason why some of those consonants which we vse are called per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect,
and othersome vnperfect, I can giue him no reason, except that our age hath tearmed those Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes
perfect, which haue beene in continuall vse since musicke began: the others they tearme vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
because they leaue in the minde of the skilfull hearer, a desire of comming to a perfect chord. And it
is a ridiculous reason which some haue giuen, that these be vnperfect cordes, because you may not begin
nor ende vpon them. But if one should aske why you may not begin nor end vpon them, I see no reason
which might be giuen except this, that they be vnperfect chords: so that in mine opinion, it is a better rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son
to say you may not begin nor end vpon them, because they be vnperfect chords, then to say that they
be vnperfect, because you may not begin nor end vpon them. And if the custome of musicians should suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer
it to come in practise, to begin and end vpon them, should they then becom perfect chords? No verily.
For <hi>I</hi> can shew many songes composed by excellent menne (as <hi>Orlando de lassus,</hi> M. <hi>White,</hi> and others)
which begin vpon the sixt: and as for the thirde, it was neuer counted any fault, either to begin or end vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: and yet will not any man say, that the third is a perfect chord. But if mine opinion might passe for a
reason, I would say that al sounds contained in habitude of multiplicity, or superparticularity, were of the
olde musicians esteemed consonantes, which was the cause that they made the <hi>diatessaron</hi> a Consonant,
although it were harsh in the eare: The <hi>tonus</hi> or whole note is indeed comprehended vnder superparticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
habitude, that is <hi>sesquioctaua,</hi> but it they counted the beginning of consonance, and not a consonant it
selfe. The <hi>sesquitonus, ditonus, semitonium cum diapente,</hi> and <hi>tonus cum diapente,</hi> (that is our flat and sharp
thirdes and sixes) they did not esteeme consonants, because they were not in habitude of multiplicity or
superparticularity, but vnder superpartients: the first and second between <hi>sesquitertia</hi> &amp; <hi>sesquiquarta,</hi> the
third and fourth betweene sesquialtera and dupla. But of this matter enough in this place, if anye desire
more of it, let him read the third booke of <hi>Iacobus Faber stapulersis</hi> his musicke. The second part of <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino</hi>
his harmonicall institutions, and <hi>Franchinus</hi> his <hi>Harmonia instrumentorum.</hi> As for singing vppon a
plainsong, it hath byn in times past in England (as euery man knoweth) and is at this day in other places,
the greatest part of the vsuall musicke which in any churches is sung. Which indeed causeth me to maruel
how men acquainted with musicke, can delight to heare such confusion as of force must bee amongste so
many singing <hi>extempore.</hi> But some haue stood in an opinion which to me seemeth not very probable, that
is, that men accustomed to descanting will sing together vpon a plainsong, without singing eyther false
chords or forbidden descant one to another, which til I see I will euer think vnpossible. For though they
should all be moste excellent men, and euery one of their lessons by it selfe neuer so well framed for the
ground, yet is it vnpossible for them to be true one to another, except one man shoulde cause all the reste
sing the same which he sung before them: and so indeed (if he haue studied the Canon before hand) they
shall agree without errors, else shall they neuer do it. It is also to be vnderstood, that when they did sing
vpon their plainsongs, he who sung the ground would sing it a sixt vnder the true pitche, and sometimes
would breake some notes in diuision, which they did for the more formall comming to their closes: but
euery close (by the close in this place, you must vnderstand the note which serued for the last syllable of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
verse in their hymnes,) he must sing in that tune as it standeth, or then in the eight below: &amp; this kind
of singing was called in Italy <hi>Falso bordone,</hi> and in England a Faburden, whereof here is an example, first
the plainsong, and then the Faburden.</p>

And though this be prickt a third aboue the plainsong, yet was it alwaies sung vnder the plainsong. Other
things handled in this part of the booke, are of themselues easily to be vnderstood. Therefore I will cease
to speake any more of them, and proceed to the explantion of other things as yet vntouched.

                  <hi>Page 147. verse 17. The eight tunes)</hi> The tunes (which are also called <hi>modi musici)</hi> the practioners
do define, to be <hi>a rule whereby the melodie of euery song is directed.</hi> Now these tunes arise out of the tunes of
the eight, according to the diuersity of setting the fift and fourth together, for the fourth may be set in the
eight, either aboue the fift, which is the harmonicall diuision or mediation (as they tearme it) of the eight,
or vnder the fift, which is the Arithmeticall mediation: and seeing there be seauen kindes of eights, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that there be 14. seuerall tunes, euery eight making two. But of these fourteene (saith <hi>Glareanus)</hi>
the musicians of our age acknowledge but eight though they vse thirteen, some of which are in more vse,
and some lesse vsual then others. And these eight which they acknowledge, they neither distinguish tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
nor set downe perfectly, but prescribe vnto them certaine rules which are neither generall, nor to the
purpose, but such as they be, the effect of them is this. Some tunes (say they) are of the odde number, as
the first, third, fift and seuenth: others of the euen number: as the second, fourth, sixt and eight: the odde
they call <hi>Autentas,</hi> the euen <hi>Plagales.</hi> To the <hi>autentas</hi> they giue more liberty of ascending then to the
<hi>Plagale,</hi> which haue more liberty of descending then they, according to this verse,
<q>Vult descendere par, sed scandere vult modus impar</q>
Also for the better helping of the schollers memory, they haue deuised these verses following.
<q>
                     <l>Impare de numero tonus est autentas, in altum</l>
                     <l>Cuius neuma salit sede apropria diapason</l>
                     <l>Pertingens, à qua descendere vix datur illi;</l>
                     <l>Vult pare de numero tonus esse plagalis in ima</l>
                     <l>Ab regione sua descendens addiatesron,</l>
                     <l>Cui datur ad quint am, raróq, ascendere sextam.</l>
                  </q>
Now these tunes consisting of the kinds of <hi>diapason</hi> or eights, it followeth to know which tunes ech kind
of diapason doth make. It is therefore to be vnderstood, that one eight hauing but one diapente or fift, it
followeth, that one diapente must be common to two tunes, the lowest key of which diapente ought to
be the finall key of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. It is also to be noted, that euery <hi>autenta</hi> may go a whole eight aboue the final
key, and that the <hi>Plagale</hi> may go but a fift aboue it, but it may goe a fourth vnder it, as in the verses nowe
set downe is manifest. So then the first tune is from <hi>dsolre</hi> to <hi>dlasolre,</hi> his fift being from <hi>dsolre</hi> to <hi>Alamire.</hi>
The second tune is from Alamire to Are, the fift being the same which was before, the lowest key of which
is common finall to both. In like maner, the third tune is from <hi>elami</hi> to <hi>elami,</hi> and the fourth from <hi>b fa ♭
mi</hi> to ♮ <hi>mi,</hi> the diapente from elami to <hi>b fa ♭ mi,</hi> being common to both. Now for the discerning of these
tunes one from another, they make three waies, the beginning, middle, and ende: and for the beginning
say they, euery song which about the beginning riseth a fift aboue the finall key, is of an autenticall tune:
if it rise not vnto the fifth it is a plagall. And for the middle, euery song (say they) which in the middle
hath an eight aboue the final keye, is of an autenticall tune: if not it is a plagal. And as for the ende,
they giue this rule, that euery song (which is not transposed) ending in <hi>G sol re vt,</hi> with the sharpe
in <hi>b fa b mi,</hi> is of the seuenth or eighth tune in f fa vt of the fifth or sixth tune, in <hi>elami</hi> of the thirde
or fourth tune, in <hi>dsolre</hi> is of the firste or second tune. And thus muche for the eight tunes, as they
be commonly taught. But <hi>Glareanus</hi> broke the yce for others to follow him into a further speculation &amp;
perfect knowledge of these tunes or <hi>modi,</hi> and for the means to discern one from another of them, he saith
thus. The tunes or <hi>modi musici</hi> (which the Greeke writers cal <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, sometimes also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
are distinguished no otherwise then the kinds of the diapason or eight from which they arise, are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
and other kindes of eightes are distinguished no otherwise then according to the place
of the halfe notes or <hi>semitonia</hi> conteined in them, as all the kindes of other consonants are distinguished.
For in the <hi>diatessaron</hi> there be foure sounds, and three distances (that is two whole notes &amp; one lesse halfe
note) therefore there be three places where the halfe note may stand. For either it is in the middle place,
hauing a whole note vnder it, and another aboue it, and so produceth the first kind of diatessaron, as from
Are to dsolre, or then it standeth in the lowest place, hauing both the whole notes aboue it, producing the
second kind of diatessaron, as from ♮ mi to elami, or then is in the highest place, hauing both the whole
notes vnder it, in which case it produceth the third and last kind of diatessaron, as from c faut to effaut,
so that how many distances any consonant hath, so many kindes of that consonant there must be, bicause
the halfe note may stand in any of the places: and therefore diapente hauing fiue soundes and foure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
(that is three whole notes and a halfe note) there must be foure kindes of diapente: the first from
dsolre to Alamire, the second from <hi>elami</hi> to <hi>bfabmi,</hi> the third from <hi>F faut</hi> to <hi>c solfaut,</hi> the fourth and laste,
from <hi>g solreut</hi> to <hi>dlasolre.</hi> If you proceed to make any more, the fift wil be the same with the first, hauing
the halfe note in the second place from below. Now the diapason conteining both the diapente &amp; diates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saron,
as consisting of the coniunction of them together, it must follow that there be as many kinds of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pason
as of both the other, which is seuen. Therefore it is manifeste that our practicioners haue erred in
making eight tunes, separating the nature of the eight from that of the firste, seeing they haue both one
kinde of diapason, though diuided after another maner in the last then in the first. But if they wil separate
the eight from the first, because in the eight the fourth is lowest, which in the first was highest: then of
force must they diuide all the other sortes of the diapason, likewise after two maners, by which meanes,
there will arise fourteene kindes of formes, tunes, or <hi>modi,</hi> And to begin at the first kind of diapason (that
<pb facs="tcp:12119:112"/>
is from <hi>are</hi> to <hi>alamire)</hi> if you diuide it Arithmeticaly, that is, if you set the fourth lowest, &amp; the fift highest,
then shall you haue the compasse of our second mood or tune, thogh it be the first with <hi>Boethius,</hi> &amp; those
who wrote before him, and is called by them <hi>Hypodorius:</hi> also if you diuide the same kind of <hi>diapason</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monically,
that is, set the fift lowest, and the fourth highest, you shal haue the compasse of that tune which
the ancients had for their ninth, and was called <hi>aeolius,</hi> though the latter age woulde not acknowledge it
for one of the number of theirs. Thus you see that the first kind of the <hi>diapason</hi> produceth twoe tunes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to two forms, of mediation or diuision. But if you diuide the second kind of <hi>diap.</hi> Arithmetically,
you shal haue that tune which the latter age tearmed the fourth, and in the old time was the second cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>hypophrygius:</hi> but if you diuide the same harmonically, setting the fift lowest, you shall haue a tune or
mood which of the ancients was iustly reiected: for if you ioine ♮ <hi>mi</hi> to <hi>F faut,</hi> you shal not make a ful fift
Also if you ioine F <hi>faut</hi> to <hi>b fa ♭ mi,</hi> you shall haue a <hi>tritonus,</hi> which is more by a great halfe note the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a fourth. And because this diuision is false in the diatonicall kind of musicke (in which you may not make
a sharpe in <hi>F faut)</hi> this tune which was called <hi>hyperaeolius</hi> arising of it was reiected. If you diuide the third
kind of <hi>diap.</hi> from <hi>Cfaut</hi> to <hi>csolfaut</hi> Arithmetically, you shal haue the compasse and essential bounds of the
sixt tune, which the ancients named <hi>hypolydius:</hi> if you diuide it harmonically, you shal haue the ancient <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
or <hi>Iastius,</hi> for both those names signifie one thing. If you diuide the fourth kind of <hi>diap.</hi> from D. to d
Arithmetically, it wil produce our eight tune, which is the ancient <hi>hyperiastius</hi> or <hi>hypomixolydius:</hi> if har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monically,
it is our first tune and the ancient <hi>dorius,</hi> so famous and recommended in the writinges of the
Philosophers. If the fift kind of <hi>diap.</hi> from <hi>Elami</hi> to <hi>elami,</hi> bee diuided arithmeticallie, it maketh a tune
which our age wil acknowledge for none of theirs, though it be our tenth indeed, and the ancient <hi>hypoae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olius,</hi>
but if it be harmonically diuided, it maketh our third tune, and the olde <hi>phrygius.</hi> But if the sixt kind
of the <hi>diap.</hi> be diuided arithmetically, it will produce a reiected mood, because from Ffaut to b fa ♭ mi, is a
<hi>tritonus,</hi> which distance is not receiued in the diatonical kind, and as for the flat in b fa ♮ b mi, it was not
admitted in diatonicall musicke, no more then the sharpe in F faut, which is a moste certain argument
that this musicke which we now vse, is not the true <hi>diatonicum,</hi> nor any <hi>species</hi> of it. But againe to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
of the eights. If the sixt kind be diuided harmonicallye, it is our fift tune and the auncient <hi>lydius.</hi>
Lastly, if you diuide the seuenth kind of diap. (which is from G to <hi>g)</hi> arithmetically, it wil make the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>hypoionicus or hypoiastius</hi> (for both those are one) but if you diuide it harmonically, it wil make our sea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenth
tune, and the ancient <hi>mixolydius.</hi> Thus you see that euery kind of diap. produceth two seueral tunes
or moods, except the second &amp; sixt kinds, which make but one a peece, so that now there must be twelue
and not only eight. Now for the vse of them (specially in tenors and plainsongs, wherein their nature is
best perceiued) it is to be vnderstood, that they be vsed either simply by themselues, or ioyned with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and by themfelues sometimes they fill all their compasse, somtimes they do not fill it, and somtime
they exceed it. And in the odde or autenticall tunes, the church musicke doth often goe a whole note vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the finall or lowest key, and that most commonly in the first and seuenth tunes: in the third it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
sometimes two whole notes vnder the finall key, and in the fift bnt a halfe note. But by the contrary in pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gall
tunes, they take a note aboue the highest key of the fift (which is the highest of the plagal) as in the
sixt and eight, in the second and fourth, they take bnt halfe a note, though sildome in the second, &amp; more
commonly in the fourth. But if any song do exceed the compasse of a tune, then bee there two tunes ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together, which may be thus: the first and second, the third and fourth, &amp;c. an autentical still beeing
ioyned with a plagal, but two plagals or two autenticals ioyned togither, is a thing against nature. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to be vnderstood that those examples which I haue in my booke set downe for the eight tunes, bee not
the true and essentiall formes of the eight tunes or vsuall moodes, but the formes of giuing the tunes to
their psalmes in the Churches, which the churchmen (falsly) beleeue to be the <hi>modi</hi> or tunes, but if we con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sider
them rightly, they be all of some vnperfect mood, none of them filling the true compas of any mood
And thus much for the twelue tunes, which if any man desire to know more at large, let him read the 2 &amp;
third bookes of <hi>Glareanus</hi> his <hi>dodecachordon,</hi> the fourth booke of <hi>Zaccone</hi> his practise of musicke, and the
fourth part of <hi>Zarlino</hi> his harmonicall institutions, where hee may satisfie his desire at full, for with the
helpe of this which here is set downe, he may vnderstand easily all which is there handled, though some
haue causelesse complained of obscuritie. Seeing therefore further discourse wil be superfluous, I wil heere
make an ende.</p>
