            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all sorrowes that doo befal the people of God, ther are none so greevous as intestine troubles, which Satan rayseth among themselves. With these, above others, we have been often afflicted, the Lord so chastening our synns, humbling us, and exercising our faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: whiles many among us, at sundry times, have turned aside from the way of truth, and holy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which God gave unto them. And not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to stray themselves alone; they have sought by al means to draw others after them: if they folow not, they make warr against them. What chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges &amp; provocations we have had by others, the world hath seen hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by works published: what now is further come upon us, they may see in part, though not as we have felt. Our adverse brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (although them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have not answered the things formerly published against their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent errours, yet) have not ceased to urge us with boastful speeches, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate letters, and publik treatises, to come into this feild: and whiles wee were otherwise imployed, they have much insulted against us; and now, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we should be quiet, they take our private letters &amp; print them: so restless is errour in it self, so troublesom unto others. And wheras <hi>Ch. Lawn</hi> and others, first declined to these our Opposites faction, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fel from evil to worse, and have set out a lewd pamphlet, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the truth and of sundry mens persons: <hi>Mr Clyfton</hi> (who hath printed my letter with M. Iohnsons answer,) intitleth his treatise, <hi>An Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement concerning Ch. Lawns book:</hi> but taking occasion by Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles therin printed, the most that he advertiseth, is against me. It was my desire and purpose to have left controversies, &amp; haue exercised my self in more quiet and comfortable meditations: but it pleaseth not God as yet, to grant my request therin. My prayer therfore is, that his gracious spirit may guide me in this conflict for his truth, and gyrd me with strength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this battel. A few things I wil here breifly note, touching our present controversie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The power of Christ which he left with his Church, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually assayled by Satan and his instruments. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">3. Ioh. 9.10.</note>began the love of preeminence, in the Apostles time: Bishops have prosequuted the same, in all ages sithence: but the high Preist of Rome did get the victorie, and wears the triple crown. Two pillars there are, which do most under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop the towr of Antichrist: 1. a proportion drawn from the goverment in Israel, 2. and a pretended privilege from Peters keyes. Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the</hi> 3. from Deut. 17.8.12. bolstreth his canon law, <note n="†" place="margin">C. aper ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerabilem. Extrav. qui sunt sil. le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git.</note> for exercising his jurisdiction over all causes &amp; persons, proportionable to the high court and Synedrion of Israel. <hi>Pighius</hi>
               <note n="“" place="margin">Hierarc. l. 4. c. 3. &amp; l. 2. c. 3.</note> writing for his Lords hierarchie, and <hi>Dorman</hi> (our countryman) his disciple, labouring <note n="*" place="margin">T. Dorm. Proof of certayn ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by M. Iewel. fol. 7.</note> to prove the same, plead from the Iewes state, how God provided to take away schismes that
<pb facs="tcp:19514:3"/>
might arise, by appointing a place and Iudge to flee unto in all such doubts, Deut 17. and would have vs think that God hath provided as wel for his church now, which hath no less need then they. And because they had the same God, the same Christ, the same faith, the same covenant &amp;c, that we, &amp; the lavv conteyned <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> a shadow of the good things to come, they think their proofs impregnable, concluding from the high Preists court in Israel, to their high Prelates consistorie in Christendom. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other popish writers (as this treatise after <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 15.16 &amp;c.</note> manifesteth,) allege the like arguments. Our opposites now, doo plead against us, from the very same grounds: <note n="“" place="margin">Treat. on Mat. 18, 17. Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pag. 32—35. &amp;c.</note> wresting a proportion from the Princes of Israel to the Ministers of the gospel, &amp; telling us we may not be strangers from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Israel, whereof see after in this treatise pag. 13.14. &amp;c. neyther of them observing, how the Angel foretold that Christ should destroy the Citie and the Sanctuarie of the Iewes, Dan. 9, 26. and so abolish Moses po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, &amp; bring an other into his house, wherin he should be found as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as Moses, Heb. 3, 2, 5, 6. And he hath forbidden his ministers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcise princelike authoritie, or dominion over his heritage; Mat. 20, 25, 26 1. Pet. 5, 1.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Papists seek shifts &amp; distinctions, to turn away the reasons that disprove their errours. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> being pressed, with judgments used heretofore in the Churches, would ease himself thus. <note n="“" place="margin">Bell. de Concil. et eccles. l. 1. c. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Ther is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iudgement</hi> (sayth he) <hi>publik and private. Publik, is that which is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by a publik judge with authoritie, so as others are bound to rest in that judgement. Private, is the sentence which every one chooseth as true, but it bindeth no man. Publick judgment in the cause of faith, is never given to the people, but private judgement somtimes is given them &amp;c.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner these our opposites, who themselves heretofore reasoned wel for the churches judging of synners from 1. Cor. 5.4 — 12. doo now seek to solute their own arguments, with the same distinction. <hi>Ther is also</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr Iohns. treat. on Mat. 18.17. p. 21.</note> (say they) <hi>a publik judgement and a private, &amp;c. The publik iudgment co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord and from his ministers, for him and the church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, whose publik officers they are. The private iudgement is to every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, touching their discerning, assenting or dissenting to or from the things spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c, as every one is perswaded. Jf this their iudgement agree with the publik, it is already signified by the officers, and so is the same with the publik. Jf some disagree, it is the dissent of such particular persons iudgement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the publik, of what sexe or conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> soever they be, that so are diversly minded, &amp; is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as there shalbe cause.</hi> Alleging for this private judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>1 Cor. 6.2.3. Act. 26.10. with 22.20. &amp; 21.25. with 15.6.22. &amp; 16.4. with 1. Cor. 5.12.13. 1. Cor. 10.15. &amp; 11.13.</hi> Now although these men quote scriptures, which the Cardinal dooth not: yet are the places but
<pb facs="tcp:19514:3"/>
for a shew; they yeild no sound proof of the question. For none of them doo manifest, that in the Churches judging of synners, Paul intended the Elders onely should have a <hi>publik judgment,</hi> and al the people beside, but a <hi>private:</hi> nay the contrary dooth appear, by the whole argument of that chapter: to omitt things which may be pressed against their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, from Act. 15.22.25.28. and other places. As, when he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth <hi>sorowing,</hi> 1. Cor. 5.2. he meant not that the Elders sorow should be <hi>publik,</hi> and the peoples <hi>private.</hi> When he willeth that the wicked man, by the power of Christ should be delivered to Satan, and cast out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among them, verse 4.5.13. he did not purpose that the Elders should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver and cast him out <hi>publikly,</hi> &amp; the people <hi>privately</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither for that busines. When he would have them purge out the old leven, that they might keep the passover with unleavened bread; verse 7.8, he meant not that the Ministers should purge the leven, and keep the feast <hi>publikly,</hi> &amp; the church <hi>privately</hi>: neyther did the type of the Passover in Israel, teach them such a thing. No nor the judging of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors in Israel: for when the Magistrates gave sentence of death, and the people stoned wicked persons at the gates of the cities: the rulers fact was not then <hi>publik,</hi> and the peoples <hi>private;</hi> the scripture teacheth us not thus to distinguish, nor reason it self: but that the execution was a part of the publik judgement. The Apostle writeth in 1. Cor. 5. to all the Church, blaming their neglect of the Censure, even as in 1. Cor. 11. he writeth to al, reproving their abuse in the Lords supper. Wherfore, if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil, they may misapply this distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all church actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as to Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, prayers, election of officers, and the like, making them <hi>publik</hi> in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and <hi>private</hi> in the church or people: and so, as the Papists doo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in other cases, give all lay men but <hi>a private spirit</hi> (as <note n="*" place="margin">Kellisons Survey, 1. book. 3. chapt.</note> they use to speak,) and the ministers onely a <hi>publik.</hi> We find not that Christian people are more excluded from being publik members of the body, and actors with their ministers in the Kingdom of Christ, then they are in the Preisthood and prophesie. And we know no reason, why the Pastor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if he consent not with the Church in casting out such an incestuous person, may not be sayd to have a <hi>private judgment,</hi> as wel as an other man. But by such popish distinctions, the clergie were severed from the laitie, and so the people by degrees, turned out of al. And what now doo these our Opposits allow the people, if they see their Elders to corrupt judgment, &amp; therfore doo dissent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; they make it but <hi>the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of particular persons judgment from the publik, of what sexe or condition soever they be,</hi> (the Christian Magistrate, when he is a member of the Church, not excepted, touching ecclesiastical proceedings,) and <hi>it is to be regarded</hi> (they say) <hi>as there shalbe cause:</hi> they mean, I trow, as the Elders themselves shall see cause. And so if a church have 3. or 4. officers, and they corrupted with heresie or other vice, the whole congregation of people, <hi>of what condition soever</hi> any persons be, can pass no <hi>publik</hi> ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
<pb facs="tcp:19514:4"/>
judgment upon them, by this doctrine: as for their <hi>private</hi> judgement or censure, the Elders themselves wil regard it as there shalbe cause. If this be not a Prelacie which the Elders would usurp, I know not what is. But of these things, see after in this Treatise, pag. 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Come wee to reproches &amp; disgracings of the truth and way of God; and wee shall see among the Papists, how they disdeyn that the people should medle in matters of religion and judging of controversies. They complayn of them for their ignorance, unrulynes, disobedience unto go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: they say <note n="*" place="margin">Dorman, Proof of articles, denyed by Mr Iewel. fol. 11.</note> the <hi>Protestants reason as Chore Dathan and Aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram did, Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 16. when they rebelled against Moses &amp; Aaron the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God; saying that there needeth here in the Church no head to govern it, because Christ is alwayes with it. And did not those wicked men</hi> (sayth the Papist) <hi>in their rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against Moses &amp; Aro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vse the same reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their face, let it suffice you that al the multitude is holy, &amp; they have God present with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And why then take you upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your selves, the rule over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Lord? As who would say, having no need of any other ruler, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them &amp;c.</hi> The very same reproches doo our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites now, cast upon us, advancing the Elders, disgracing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note n="†" place="margin">See after in this treatise, p. 37.39.</note> by intimating their <hi>simplicity</hi> &amp; <hi>errour</hi>; charging us as oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of government; and abusing against vs the example of <hi>Corah Datha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Abiram,</hi> (as we have often heard with greif,) telling us, we goe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their grounds, and the like. For which we wish they may find repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and mercy with the Lord, least he turn the evil upon their own heads, as Moses then did upon the Levites. For unto them <note n="“" place="margin">Num. 16.9.10.</note> 
               <hi>it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a smal thing that the God of Israel had separated them from the multitude of Israel, to take them neer unto himself, to doo the service of the Tabernacle, &amp; to stand before the Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to minister vnto them, but they sought the office of the Preist also</hi>: so these our opposers are not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with their office, to be <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1.1.</note> separated unto the gospel of God, to stand and minister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and unto the Congregation, but wil needs be the Congregation it self, and take more authoritie then is given them from <note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 3.27.</note> heaven: wherof see after in this book, pag. 17.21.22.23. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What enmitie and persecution the Papists have raysed against the withstanders of their heresies, I need not speak: al nations have felt of their cruelty. Neyther would I here mention our opposite brethrens hard measure to us, but that themselves have printed, and seek to defend it, &amp; cease not stil to prosecute their purposes against us. Although them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have lately professed, practised, &amp; publikly mainteyned the truthes, which now they oppugn and persecute: and bringing innovation into the Church, would needs obtrude their errours upon our consciences, eyther in judgment or in practise, or in both. Yea breaking the peace which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had devised, agreed unto and confirmed; because their brethren would not agree to the undoing of themselves and their families, for the
<pb facs="tcp:19514:4"/>
satisfying of their wills, as is after manifested in this treatise, pag. 123, &amp;c. If the Lord should reward them according to their works herein towards us, their account wil be heavy: but my prayer shalbe against their evils.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wheras many Treatises have been written in defense of the truthes we mainteyn: these our Opposers answer them not; neyther yet are they silent, nor wil give rest unto others, but urge aad provoke more writing stil. For the Churches power now in controversie, our <hi>Apologie</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 62.63.</note> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nine reasons: these have answered onely one of them, which is the sixt, drawn from Mat. 18.17. all the other they let stand. And yet what cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours have we heard, because their exceptions against that one, are not by us refuted! So in our other articles of differences, the scriptures and reasons set down in our Apologie and other books, they pass by without answer. If they can make any colourable exception, they spare it not: otherwise, for want of argument, they fall to asking of questions, seeking if they can to insnare us. Of which things the reader may see after in this book, pag. 45, &amp;c. &amp; 51. &amp;c. &amp; 59, &amp;c. &amp; 23, &amp;c. The reasons pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon adversaries, <hi>Mr Some, Mr Giffard, Mr Bernard</hi> and others, touching the baptisme and church of Rome, &amp; other like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, these men now take up against us. The answers published by Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Mr Robinson, they pass by, as if they knew them not: yea their own former answers and writings, they take not away; and yet (which is most strange,) they ceass not to press us with the same things. I might wel have stayed my pen upon these considerations, at least until our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers had given themselves further answer, and manifested what of their former profession they wil stil abide by: but their importunacie wil not suffer me to be silent. Wherfore, (humbly craving the Lords asistance,) for the defense of the faith once given to the Saincts, &amp; for my brethrens good (if it may be,) who are thus fallen into errour and evil, I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this answer to their ADVERTISEMENT, (so farr as it concerneth me,) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring by the word of God, to reduce them agayn into the right way. Their straying from it, is a reproch to the world, a scandal to the weak, dangerous to their own souls, and to me most dolorous, and my soul shall weep in secret for them, remembring our former amitie &amp; concord in the truth. And I shal yet labour for their good, both by prayer unto God, and by the utmost of my poor indevours o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therweise, so long and so farr as I may.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S they that styrr up warrs and strife, <note n="“" place="margin">Iudg, 11.13. &amp;c.</note> impute the cause unto others, which lyeth on them selves: so these our opposers, which wil needs bid us battel, yet begin it as occasioned by us thereunto. They object <hi>1.</hi> our private letters, and <hi>2.</hi> printed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as reasons moving them to print against us. But how vveighty motives these are on their part; let the discreet reader judge, by these our answers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I wrote no such letters to any, til they had printed their first book, and so possessed the world with the strife. 2. Mine were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, to freinds &amp; brethren; theirs publick, even to enemies also. 3. They did it of their own proper wil and motion; I was provoked sundry wayes, by letters from abroad, and freinds at home. For example, one writeth to me thus: <hi>Because it is doubted by some, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whither [Mr Jo.] his practise with you, be answerable to his writing: but also whither in his writing ther be not a discoherence, he being so intricate that many cannot apprehend his meaning: my earnest desire is, and the desire of many others among us, that you would afford us this favour, to signify to us by your letter, the certaynty</hi> &amp;c. Another writeth to my freind thus, <hi>we not knowing wel to send a letter unto M. A. thought good to write unto you to intreat him to write unto us concerning the differences that be amongst you &amp;c. Those that come over of M. J. his side, say they hold no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Eldership, then M. A. hath written against M. Smyth: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say to the contrary; we doo therfore intreat M. A. to certifie us of the truth</hi> &amp;c. Vpon these and the like motives there and here by some that went over to their freinds, I have written as I was necessarily occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned privately, of the differences between us; making account my letters would come to our opposites hand, as is fallen out: for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I am not sory, save so farr as hereby they occasion their own evils to be further manifested, which I had rather (if so it pleased God)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19514:6"/>
they were hid and buryed by repentance. 4. Themselves have doon the like, and even this Advertiser wel knowes, who wrote to a freind in Engl. perswading against us that saying of the Apostle, <hi>Receiv him not to house neyther bid him God speed: 2. Joh. 10.</hi> which letter (if we would have sought occasion as they have,) we might ere this have printed, with the answer. By this al may see, how partial these men are, which advertise the world of our writing <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly</hi>; when themselves (if it be a fault) are guilty of the same.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching the printed Articles, so often spoken of in their Advertisement; as we had no hand in, or knowledge of the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of them: so must we now shew the reason, of <hi>giving them out,</hi> as we did, being even against our wills forced therunto, by the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of these our Opposers.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First, for the Scornful that printed those articles, they <note n="†" place="margin">Lawnes book. pag. 78. 82.</note> bear the world in hand, as if the Congregation wherof I am, and my self had sued others at the law, for the meeting howse: wheras the contrary was publikly agreed in our Church, that we would rather bear the wrong, than trouble the Magistrate with our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: neyther have we ever commenced such a suit. 2. But wheras two of our brethren and a widow, were cheif owners of the building, they sought first in private freindly manner to come to agreement with their opposite brethren, but could not; then they desired to put it to the arbitrement of indifferent citizens, but the other party refused: wherupon our brethren signifyed to vs, that they must seek help of the Magistrate, for the estate of some of them was such as they could not bear the loss and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage. And asked us, if the churches right were caled in question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for our adversaries plea was the church the church,) what should be answered before the magistrate? We, with signification as before, that we would rather suffer wrong, then sue at law; yet could not hinder them of seeking for their particular right: &amp; if in so doing the churches right were called in question, that then some certayn appointed, should answer for the same. 3. Those our brethren (before they went to the Iudges,) intreated the help of the Burgemasters, the cheif of the City: who laboured by perswasion with our Opposites, to put the matter to the arbitrement of good men chosen by both sides, but they stil peremptorily refused. 4. When it was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudges, they also at first both perswaded unto, and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19514:6"/>
two indifferent men to hear the case: but when our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers came before them, they refused to stand to their arbitrement. The Iudges the second time appointed them, with a mulct or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those that refused their arbitrement: but our adverse par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, persisted in their refusal as before: and urged sentence of the Magistrates, and pleaded that <hi>they which build on another mans ground, are by law to loose their building</hi>; which plea they made, because the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the ground was made in the name of one man onely, (now among them,) whose name was used but in trust, for any other might have had the same as wel as hee, as was proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magistrate by sufficient witness. Now unto these Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appointed, did our brethren willingly referr the cause, and to them (inquiring of the differences) were those Articles exhibited: which it seemeth those Libellers, or their Scribe, by some means that wee know not of, procured a copy of, and so printed them. What cause now have these our opposers, to find such fault with our giving out those articles, which we were constreyned by them selves to doo, unless we should have suffred the truth to have bene troden down? They rather have cause to acknowledge their own stiff &amp; refractary cariage, who would not yeild to any good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel given them, by our brethren, by Arbiters, or by Magistrates; til law forced them therunto: and so have occasioned many wayes, our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon adversaries to rejoyce.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>we have not</hi> (sayth the <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 17.</note> Advertisement) <hi>as we ought, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and justified the causes for which we separated; which were annexed at the end of the Treatise on Mat. 18.17. but have gone about also to possess the world with other matters.</hi> So <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 31.</note> after they urge agayn this point, <hi>that we leav the Treatise unanswered, which was purposely written upon that occasion and argument.</hi> I answer. <hi>1.</hi> We handled and justified the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for which we separated, by word of mouth in much disputing, before we left them: and this for them was as we ought, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, according to the Apostles practise, <hi>Act. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.8.9.</hi> And now we are by their importunacie, caled to handle and justifie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world in writing: which whither we doo as we ought, the sequel shal shew, to the judicious reader. 2. It is not we, but they which have gone about to possess the world with other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for the things we charge them with, themselves in effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; and as wel as they can doo defend them. But their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19514:7"/>
declaration against us in the Treat. on <hi>Mat. 18.</hi> is defective; and the 7. points they article <note n="†" place="margin">Advertis. p. 27. &amp;c.</note> now against us, are superfluous; and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously wrested against us, as our answers to them shal manifest. The controversie in deed began upon the exposition of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> but so as we have heard in times past Anabaptists begin controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie upon <hi>Mat. 28.19.</hi> who have reasoned both from that and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scriptures, against the baptising of infants: so these opposites from <hi>Mat 18.17.</hi> and al other scriptures that we could bring, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned against the power of the people in judging syn &amp; synners. We formerly <note n="*" place="margin">Apol, p. 65.</note> professing the Church there to be Elders and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple joyntly: they now striving that it is not so, but the Elders one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we knew it must be eyther the name or the power of the church, that they would have. And we never thought them so vayn, as to make such a styrr for a name or title: we held therfore to the <hi>power</hi> which Christ hath given to his church for judging of them that are within, <hi>1. Cor. 5.4.12.13.</hi> Of this when we pressed them, they first gave this answer, that the Elders had <hi>the rightful power</hi> to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate though without and against the consent of all the people, but not <hi>the able power</hi>: even as David had rightful power to put Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab to death, but was not able, because others were too hard for him: <hi>2. Sam. 3.39.</hi> To which we answered; in matters of this life, which are external, men may be hindred by outward force: but in the spiritual administration of the Church not so: Gods word (by which they administer) is not in bonds, <hi>2 Tim. 2.9.</hi> But if one man onely have the power from Christ, he may use it, <note n="†" place="margin">Ier. 1.9.10</note> against all the world. So upon better consideration, a week after, they affirmed the Elders to have both <hi>rightful power,</hi> and <hi>able power,</hi> to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, though without and against the consent of all the people. And thus was ful power put in the Elders hands: &amp; of the people they sayd, their power and right was as in Israel, and in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive churches. But being asked what that was? answer was made, it was to be inquired. So the poor people are left to seek their right wher they can find it: the Elders have ynough, they have found that they sought for.</p>
               <p>As Paul to disswade the Corinthians from their errour in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the resurrection, shewed them the dangerous consequences of the same, as <note n="‘†" place="margin">1 Cor. 15 13, 14. &amp;c.</note> that <hi>if ther be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen, then the Apostles preaching was vayn, then the Churches fayth was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19514:7"/>
vayn,</hi> &amp;c. so I held it my duty to shew the people the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the former error, which though at first it may seem smal, yet is it as a strong fort in the mouth of a country, which if the enemy win, the whole land is soon lost. For if all the power of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in and casting out, were given to the Elders: then our Church which was first gathered and constituted, did receiv in and cast out members without Elders, was not planted by the power of Christ; neyther had they authoritie to set up Elders if they could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn vpon desert depose them, and if they had not power to judge their brethren, much less could they judge their Elders. And here came in the gathering of the church by vertue of popish baptisme, and of receiving the ministery from Rome, as wel as the baptisme, and the like, which our opposites were and must necessarily be driven unto, for defense of their errour. And as for the first ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of this church, they sayd an error in the doing, overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the action: for Isaak erred in blessing Iaakob in sted of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau, yet the action did stand. To which we answered, that it was doon by a person who had power from God to give the blessing, and the action was also confirmed by the evidence of Gods spirit afterward: but this people (upon our opposites doctrine) had no authority from God, to doo as they did, neyther could they shew any confirmation of the work by God, if our former grounds fayl us.</p>
               <p>The sentence given in the end by the Elders that leaned to the Pastors error, was, not that discourse they speak of at the end of the Treatise on Mat. 18. (for that was privately penned afterward by the Pastor himself,) but a breif and yet large approbation of the things which the Pastor had shewed, to be <hi>the truth</hi>; and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that <hi>by the grace of God they would so practise.</hi> Vpon which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giving, we on the contrary approved our former profession published, and shewed sundry reasons (which hereafter shalbe set down) why we could not yeild to their new vowed <hi>practise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because they alwayes sought to extenuate the controversie, as if it were but a strife about words, or about the meaning of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> We purposely prevented it, signifying expressly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted, that we would bear with them in their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> so as they would yeild the point in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, (which was about the Churches power,) from other scriptures,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19514:8"/>
shewing it also by an other case, that if we had to deal upon <hi>John. 1.</hi> with an Arian that denyes the godhead of Christ, if he would plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely yeild to the truth of that doctrine, though he thought it not proved by Iohn. 1, (where yet it is evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,) we would bear with him therin. And this we still offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feighnedly to these our opposite brethren, let them yet directly and plainly renounce the error it self touching the power of the church now ingrossed into the Elders hands, and the other errours that necessarily flow from the same: and we wil bear with their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> though we think of it otherweise that doo they.</p>
               <p>Moreover seing we offred much more, (which concerneth not onely <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> but al other scriptures,) that <hi>we would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our difference of judgement, have continued together, if our former practise might have been reteyned</hi>; and themselves in their Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 73.</note> can not deny this: how doo they then bear the world in hand, that the breach among us vvas for the understanding of <hi>Math. 18.17?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching their Treatise on <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> the causes why I have not answered it are. <hi>1.</hi> When others heretofore (as namely Mr. Smyth) wrote against the truth w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they formerly professed: we al thought best not to answer, til the second and third time we were excedingly provoked: for we considered how the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon adversary would rejoyce at our intestine troubles. The same I minded here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and these men should (if they were not partial) have doon the like. 2. I had experience, in former dealing vvith M. Smyth, of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayednes, that vvould not stand to the things vvhich himself had vvritten: I mind the like in these Opposites, vvho are not setled for the constitution of their Church and Ministerie, upon any ground that I knovv of, unless it be popish succession. Their former vvritings about the Church and ministery, and their present estate, wil not stand togither. Seing those books are unanswered by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they should answer them (if they can) themselves; and shew us by Gods word what is allowable, vvhat disallovvable in them. Till they doo this, vvho vvould vvillingly deal vvith them? 3. Ther are 9. reasons in that our <note n="“" place="margin">pag. 62.63.</note> Apologie to confirm the povver of the Church novv in question: the foresaid Treatise dealeth but against one of them, leaving the rest there, and vvhatsoever is vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19514:8"/>
of that argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in other our books, unansvvered: what reason have they to cal so upon others to write, when so much is already written? If they yeild us the cause, upon the other reasons, we wil not strive about the meaning of one scripture, as before vve shevved.</p>

               <p n="44">44.

Provided alwayes, that if any dissention shal happen between the ministers and seniors, or the more part of them, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the congregation, or the more part of it: and that the sayd ministers and seniors in such controversie, being desired therto, wil not assemble the congregation; that then the congregation may of it self come togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and consult and determine as concerning the sayd controversie or controversies, and the sayd assembly to be a lawful congregation, and that which they, or the more part of them so assembling, shal judge or decree, the same to be a lawful decree and ordinance, of sufficient force to bind the whole congregation, and every member of the same.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Item in case some doo depart [out of the sayd congregation] that yet not withstanding, those which stil remayn, (if they be the greater part) to be a lawful congregation: and that which they or the more part of them shal decree, to be a lawful decree, of force to bind the whole body, ministers, seniors, deacons, and every other member or members therof without exception.</p>

               <p n="54">54. Ther be 3. degrees of ecclesiastical discipline: first, that the offender acknowlege his fault, and shew himself penitent before the ministers and seniors.

The 3. that if he remayn stil obstinate before the whole congregation, after a time to him by the whole congregation limitted to repent in, he then shalbe openly denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced excommunicate: which excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seing it is the uttermost pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of ecclesiastical power, shal not therfore be executed until the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be heard by the whole Church, or such as it shal specially appoint ther unto.</p>
               <p n="62">62. If al the ministers and seniors [which have authority to hear and determine &amp;c.] be suspected, or found parties, or if any appeal be made from them: that then such appeal be made to the body of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ministers, seniors, and parties excepted: and that the body of the congregation may appoint so many of the congregation to hear &amp; determine the sayd matter or matters, as it shal seem good to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p n="65">65. That the Ministers and Seniors, and every of them, be subiect to ecclesiastical discipline, and correction, as other private members of the Church be.</p>
               <p n="67">67. If any controversie be upon the doubtful meaning of any word or words in the discipline; that first it be referred to the ministers &amp; seniors.

               <p>These and the like things were agreed of by that church, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the exorbitant power which the ministers then chalenged: wherby the reader may see, <hi>1.</hi> what the learned and most conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable of the church of England held heretofore: which if they had continued in, would have freed them of al antichristian prelacie, the bane of so many churches. 2.

               <head>Of the Letter by <hi>M. Iohnson</hi> answered and published, and by <hi>H. Ainsworth</hi> now defended. Wherin the Articles of difference between both parties, are set down and discussed.</head>
               <p>THree things are to be treated of. 1. The points wherin they are gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their former profession. 2. The points wherin they now charge us to differ from our former profession. 3. The conditions of peace, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</p>
               <p>For an entrance into this controversie, M. Iohnson gives 5. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations. <note n="*" place="margin">Advertis. p. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>First, that wee left them upon two particular matters, (concerning the Churches government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the exposition of Mat. 18, 17.) &amp; doo not directly keep to them as we ought, nor answer the things printed.</hi> I answer: this their beginning is ambiguous and fraudulent. The <hi>churches government,</hi> is somtime taken largely; sometime strictly: sometime it is spoken of Christ, <hi>upon whose shoulders the</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Isa. 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>government is</hi>; and hereof ther was no controversie. Sometime it is spoken of the ministerial <note n="“" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17. 1. Cor. 12.28.</note> ruling and governing the church by Elders: neyther of this doe we make any question; but hold (as <note n="‘†" place="margin">Confes. art. 19.</note> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that Christ governeth his church outvvardly by their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. Sometime men use it generally for the whole outward po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, power, and (as many cal it) discipline of the Church: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this in part our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversie was. But I wil manifest the frawd. We in our published writings, distinguish the <hi>government,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi>: acknowledging <note n="*" place="margin">Confess. art. 17.19.26.</note> 
                  <hi>government</hi> to be by the officers; but <note n="“" place="margin">Conf. art. 22.23.24. Apol. p 46.47.60.62.</note> 
                  <hi>power</hi> in the whole body of the Church. And for this point of <hi>power,</hi> are 9. reasons set down, wherof one is drawn from Christs speech, <hi>Mat. 18.17. tel the Church.</hi> Apol. pag. 62.63.</p>
               <p>Between these two is the matter so conveyed, as while we plead for the churches right and power, we are sayd to oppugn gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and when we yeild the Elders to govern, they therby would inclose the whole power in their hands; as in the furder handling of these things shal appear. But if a church have one minister one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is to teach and govern them by the word of God: yet is not any one man a Church, neyther hath the power of a Church. Yea
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19514:10"/>
this distinction is in one particular, by themselves acknowledged, in the same book: <note n="†" place="margin">Advertis. p. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>it is</hi> (they say) <hi>undenyable, that to give voices in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is not a part of government, or a duty peculiar to the governours of the church, but an interest, power, right and libertie, that the saincts and people out of office have.</hi> Very wel sayd; wherupon we inferr also, that to give voices in <note n="‘†" place="margin">Act. 15.7.12.22.23.25 1. Cor. 5.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 13.</note> deciding of controversies, and judging of synners, is not a part of government, but a power and right that the saincts out of office have. The Elders are to teach direct and govern the church in election of officers; they are to doo the like in judging &amp; excommunicating wicked persons, and in all other publik affairs. Of the exposition of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> and why their Treatise was not particularly answered, I have spoken before: &amp; the special things therin, are in this treatise repeted, and so shalbe here answered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their second observation I like wel, &amp; yeild unto; that men may change and redress, according to Gods word, things that are amyss: but withal, I would have them, 1. plainly to acknowledge wherin they erred, and what they stablish for truth; and 2. to take away by Gods word, the reasons wherupon they builded before. Which wither these our opposers have doon as they ought; I leav it for the discreet reader to judge by their writings, compared with those which were published heretofore to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third, for <hi>the churches goverment by the officers,</hi> is that which we alwayes have and stil do yeild to, as even now I shewed. As for our former practise altered, and as he sayth, by me acknowledged: towching the order and manner of the practise in one particular, I grant it; but for the <hi>power of the Church,</hi> wherof we treat, I deny it. There never was such a practise in my dayes, as wherby the <hi>Elders</hi> should be esteemed the <hi>Church,</hi> and to have the povver of the same.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The 4. observation is that <hi>our exceptions are such as the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists would object in much like manner.</hi> Yet dooth he not shew this so to be: and I know, for their successive Ministerie, they are neerer the Anabaptists than wee: &amp; both for it and other points, they build upon the very grounds of poperie, as after shalbe manifested. But what doe vve <hi>except</hi>? is it not from our former Articles, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie confirmed by scriptures, from vvhich these are departed: in penning also vvherof these that thus vvrite, had a principal hand? So they doo hereby not onely joyn vvith our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon <note n="“" place="margin">D. Some. M. Giss. M.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19514:11"/>
ovvn former vvritings and cause, vvherin more strength of truth hath appeared then ever they shalbe able to pul dovvn, hovvsoever they may assayl it.</p>
               <p>The 5. observation is a mist cast before the readers eyes, a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of 7. things vvherin they vvould make men beleev, vve are gone from that vve held heretofore. The errour vvherof I vvil shevv hereafter vvhen (as order requireth,) I have examined the ansvvers that they make for themselves, to these our Articles, vvhich novv next folovv.</p>
               <div n="1" type="point">
                  <head>The first point of difference: in the Letter.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Wheras we had learned and professed, that <note n="*" place="margin">Confess. art. 24. Apol. p. 62.63.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ hath given the power to receiv in or to cut off any member, to the whole body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither of every Congregation, and not to any one, or moe members sequestred from the whole:</hi> now wee have been lately taught, that the Church which Christ sendeth to, for the redress of synns Mat. 18.17. is not to be understood of the whole body of the Congregation, but of the Church of Elders. And it being granted of al, that with the Church is the power, the Elders being the Church, have the power, and so not the whol body of the congregation togither.</p>
                  <p>And in the copie vvhich Lavvne printed.</p>
                  <p>The 24. Article [of the Confession of our faith,] (confirmed in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, pag. 60.62.63.) professeth that the povver to receiv in, or to cut off any member, is given to the whole body togither of every Christian Congregation, Mat. 18.17. &amp;c. These have pleaded for the Eldership to be the Church, Mat. 18. and to have both rightful power and able power to excommunicate, though without &amp; against the consent of the body of the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>The scriptures to confirm our former doctrine and practise, are in our Confession, Psal. 122.3. Act. 2.47. Rom. 16.2. Mat. 18.17. 1. Cor. 5.4. 2. Cor. 2.6.7.8. Levit. 20.4.5. &amp; 24. 14. Num. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.3. Deut. 13.9.</p>
                  <p>The reasons in our Apologie are nine, the first referring to proofs of former positions, the other 8, confirmed by sundry arguments doctrines &amp; practises gathered from the Prophetical and Apostolical scriptures.</p>
                  <p>For ansvver hereunto, their <hi>Advertisement</hi> telleth vs many things. First of their <hi>Treatise</hi> published on <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> touching vvhich, I also have spoken before. Neyther is this point of the <hi>Churches power</hi> therin plainly handled, but closely caried: neyther is ther any thing at al sayd, to take avvay the other 8. reasons, in our Apologie. Let the reader compare the writings, and judge. There be also
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19514:11"/>
things formerly written both by others and by them selves, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this of <hi>Mat. 18.</hi> and things lately published against M. Bernard about it: to these they give no answer at al, yet cal they upon us to write more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly they carp at this phrase, <hi>the Church of Elders</hi>; and would have it the <hi>Congregation</hi> or <hi>Assemble of Elders</hi>: saying that so men might <hi>sooner perceiv the vanitie of our error.</hi> And that I my self elswhere shew the word is sometime used for an <hi>Assemblie of Elders.</hi> I answer; 1. If they wil rase the word <hi>Church,</hi> out of the Bible, as unfit, they may doo so in <hi>Mat. 18.</hi> and in this controversie: or els they must give us leav, to keep wonted known words, which help men to discern the truth of matters. 2. Neyther shew they any one scripture for the phrase they would have, the <hi>Congregation of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>: neyther did I ever shew or could see the word <hi>Church</hi> so to mean in al the new Testament: but in the old (which now is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,) I have observed it in some few places. 3. But be it <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congregation,</hi> I wil not much contend: yet I know their eyes wil da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel that look hereby to <hi>discern</hi> in our doctrine eyther <hi>vanity</hi> or <hi>error.</hi> Albeit I confess these our opposites, have the Papists on their side; for so Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bellarmine <note n="†" place="margin">De Verbo Dei, lib. 3. c. 5.</note> expoundeth this <hi>Tel the Church,</hi> that is the <hi>Prelate,</hi> or the <hi>Congregation of Prelates</hi>; &amp; <note n="*" place="margin">De autor. eccles. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thirdly, they observe that the scriptures of the old testament are quoted for our 24. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, as <hi>directly carying us for this matter to the Church of Jsrael; which now we would not be brought unto. &amp;c.</hi> I answer; the first is true, for the scriptures cited doo shew that the people were interessed in those publike actions with their magistrates: and therfore there is no reason that now there ministers should claym the whole power to themselves. The latter is untrue; for we did <hi>consider and decide the matter between us,</hi> by the scriptures of the old Testament, compared with the new, and so are stil ready to doo. But alwayes with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the differences between the state of the church then &amp; now; which are many, as the Apostles doo teach us. <hi>Heb. 8. &amp; 9. &amp; 10. chapters.

                  <p n="4">4. Their last observation hath two branches: the 1. <hi>that the power of receiving in &amp; cutting off in Jsrael, was to be performed according to order; and not to weaken but to stablish thhe Elders authoritie.</hi> This we

willingly gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: neither ever doubted of. But we observ withal, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt which they couch under this name <hi>Elders</hi>: which usually in the old Testament, is given to <hi>Magistrates</hi>

I answer, by <hi>politie,</hi> they mean not, I hope, the inward faith which Israel had: but the outward order of administring in that Church: otherweise they reason neyther properly nor to the question in hand.

                  <p n="5">5. They referr us in the beginning of their Treatise on Mat. 18.17. to a place in Mat. 5.22.23. &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>I answer; Christ might farr better be understood then, then our opposites may now: his words are cleare, but not to the purpose that they cite them. Christ there speaketh not of men judging on earth, but of Gods judging in heaven. For men had not power to condemn to <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5.22.</note>

God would doo: neyther was every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that caled his brother <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka,</hi> to be brought to the <hi>Synedrion</hi> at Ierusalem, the lesser courts in the cities, could hear and end such matters. The Iew Doctors say, <note n="†" place="margin">Talmud Bab. tract.

                     <hi>whosoever killeth shalbe culpable of judgment,</hi> that is, he should <note n="‘*" place="margin">Exod. 21.12.</note> dye by Gods law: and further then outvvard actual murder they went not.

                     <hi>unadvised anger,</hi> should be punished with death by God; and as it did increase and shevv it self in evil speeches, so should their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be increased in hel: which he setteth down by allusion to the sundry civil judgments in Israel. And so he procedeth to teach men the true keeping of the law, by love and reconciliation; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they should be cast into <note n="a" place="margin">verse 25.</note> 
                     <hi>the prison</hi> of hel: how ever such synns were not punishable by men. But in <hi>Mat. 18.</hi> Christ speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of judgments <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 18.17.18.</note>

                     <hi>the Church,</hi> that is, (as Paul <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.4.5.12.</note> sheweth) the ecclesiastical assembly gathered in Christs name. Wherfore the <hi>church</hi> in Mat. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>17. is not the <hi>Synedrion</hi> in Mat. 5.22. as these would have it. Or if it be, then is it meant of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and not of the church ministers, unto whom these would now draw it. For, were <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 4.20.</note> the Ministers and preachers of the law in the synagogues; judges in the synedrion? <hi>Sheliach Isibbur, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ecclesiae, the messenger of the Congregation,</hi> was he the cheif of the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrion, as the <hi>Pastor</hi> (vvho they say is <hi>Angelus ecclesiae</hi>) is now cheif in the Eldership?

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication according to the law of God, &amp; the people should accordingly put it in execution, by avoiding the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate persons til they repent.</hi> I answer; this comparison is faulty many wayes. First, it speaketh onely of <hi>a rightful power,</hi> wheras the thing they should answer to, is both <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and able power,</hi> as themselves once distinguished: or let them say, whether the Church that Christ sendeth to for redress of syn, hath not <hi>able power</hi> to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. <hi>2.</hi> Secondly it matcheth the power of the Ministers in spiritual things, with the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in civil things: which what is it, but to make the one Lords spiritual, as the other are Lords temporal; according to the Popish hierarchie? 3. Thirdly it misseth in the proportion of the Preists judging leprosie; for Gods law in Lev. 13.2. is, that the suspected person should <hi>be brought to Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Preist or to one of his sons the Preists</hi>; and the <note n="*" place="margin">verse 3.6. &amp;c.</note>Preist should look, and pronounce him unclean, or clean, as he discerned it. The proportion hereto now, is one Bishop or Minister, rather than a Church of Ministers: for if one Preist might judge then, why may not one Minister judge now? Doe not the Papists, which <note n="†" place="margin">Bellarm. de Rom. Pont. l. 5. c. 8.</note>allege this very example, and apply it to one Preist: make a fitter proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then they that deny this power unto one, and yet apply it unto many? 4. Fourthly, thus farr I grant this proportion, that as every Preist then might according to the law, declare what was leprosie: so every Minister now, may and ought by the law to declare what is syn and heresie; and this though it be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19514:15"/>
without and against the consent of the Church &amp; of all the world. <hi>Ezek. 3.17,—21.2. Tim. 4..1.2. Tit. 1.9.</hi> But as then, not the preist onely, but the <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 5.2.</note> children of Israel, put every leper out of the host: so now, not the minister onely, but the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, the church, are to <note n="‘*" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.12.13.</note> put the wicked out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among them, as the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>5.</hi> Fiftly, if the Elders the Magistrates, might (as these men say) give sentence of death against a man, though <hi>without and against the peoples consent</hi>; &amp; then it was for the people <hi>to perform the execution</hi>: then that people, I say, were in great subjection and servitude to their Elders, that must execute that man, to whose death they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented not: and to shape the Ministers power now accordingly, is to make them Lords, and the Church their subjects and servants: yea the Pope himself never had men in greater slaverie. I know, when Gods law condemned a man, if it were shewed by all or any one of the Iudges, or Preists, or Prophets, yea or Israelites; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should in order have executed him: but oft times the heads of the people <note n="a" place="margin">Mich. 3.11.</note> judged for rewards, the Princes <note n="b" place="margin">Zeph. 3.3 4. Isa. 1.23.</note> as Lions, the Iudges as Wolves devoured them, the Preists polluted the sanctuarie, and wrested the law. And then the people of the land, <note n="c" place="margin">Levit. 20.2.4.</note> whose duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it was to look to open wickednes, were neyther to folow <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 23.2.7.</note> the many nor mighty in evil. And that the Iudges had power to put any man to death, whom the people judged innocent, I find not, but would see it proved. I find how in Naboths case (though it were a wicked fact,) ther was <note n="e" place="margin">1 King. 21.12·13.</note> a solemn fast and assemblie of the people with the governours: how in Ieremies case, he was accused <note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 26.11.12.16.</note> to the Princes and people, made his defense to princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was acquitted by princes and people. When <note n="g" place="margin">1. Sam. 14.39.44.45.</note> King Saul sware that Ionathan should dye; the people sware the contrary, &amp; saved him from death: when the high preists &amp; scribes would have kylled Christ, they feared the people, <hi>Luk. 20.19. &amp; 22.2.</hi> and the people as wel as the rulers, were caled before Pilate about Christs death, <hi>Luk. 23.13.</hi> and by their voices prevayled, <hi>Mat. 27.20.22.25.26. Luk 23.23.</hi> So that to prove the Ministers sole power now, for to cut off a man from the Church, by the Magistrates power then to cut off a man from Israel, neyther is the proportion just, if it were so, neyther yet is it manifested that so it was in Israel. 6. Sixtly, the proportion which they here make, is so misshapen; that I marvel wise men would ever bring it forth to the view of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19514:15"/>
world. For they make the <hi>avoiding of the excommunicated person</hi> by the people, to be <hi>the executing of the sentence of excommunication</hi>; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this censure is properly executed by him that in the name of Christ and with consent of the Church, <hi>delivereth the wicked man to Satan,</hi> as the Apostle willeth, <hi>1. Cor. 5.</hi> which being doon, the man is certaynly excommunicated, whither the people avoyd his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or not. And if they otherweise here understand the word <hi>execution</hi>; they doo but deceiv the reader with an aequivocation.</p>
                  <p>This their other example of <hi>the sentence of death,</hi> and the <hi>execution</hi> therof, wil plainly manifest. For Pilate <note n="‘†’" place="margin">Luk. 23.24.</note> 
                     <hi>gave sentence</hi> of death upon Christ; the <note n="‘*’" place="margin">Ioh. 19.23.34.</note> souldjers that kylled him with nayles and spear, they executed the sentence of death, as we commonly speak and understand. Then <note n="“" place="margin">vers. 38.— 43.</note> Ioseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, embaulmed him with myrrh, wound him in a sheet, and layd him in grave: shal we say that these two now were the <hi>executioners</hi> of Christ; because they caryed themselves towards him as towards a dead man? Or if any refreyned from touching a dead man that had been hanged, least by him they <note n="‘*" place="margin">Num. 19.11.</note>should be polluted: did they here by <hi>execute</hi> him? No more doo they properly <hi>execute the sentence of excommunication,</hi> which avoyd the company of one excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 7. But because al the weight of their wrested <hi>proportion</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Israel, is couched herein: let us look upon it a litle more. In their Treatise on Mat. 18. there <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 19.</note> they say: <hi>in Jsrael, such as would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Preists and Judges, were to dye by the hands of the people, Deut. 17.</hi> Agayn they say, <note n="*" place="margin">ibid. p. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>delivering to Satan,</hi> in <hi>1. Cor. 5.</hi> is in sted <hi>of death in Jsrael. Levit. 20.11.</hi> By this, one would think, that the <hi>people</hi> now should deliver a wicked man to Satan, when the Elders have judged him worthy: otherweise, how stands the <hi>proportion</hi>? But they mean nothing less: for a litle after, they <note n="“" place="margin">ibid. p. 26</note> tel vs, <hi>in the Churches excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, ther is the giving of a sentence judiciarie, which perteyneth to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authority; there is also in particular, a delivering to Satan, by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ &amp;c. which likewise implieth authority; &amp; that it is proportionably answerable to the taking away by death &amp;c, that it is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial use of the keyes given by Christ to the Apostles; that the force herof is such, as therby a man is not onely cast out of that particular Church wherof he was a member, but is cutt off &amp; excluded from all churches vpon earth: as on the contrary by baptisme, wee are entred into communion with al Churches of Christ in the world.</hi> By these things compared togither, we may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19514:16"/>
observ: 1. that the church elders may by their sole authoritie give <hi>judiciarie sentence,</hi> that a man shalbe excommunicated: answerable to the Magistrates in Israel, that gave sentence a man should be put to death. 2. That the Elders may also by authoritie in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>deliver a man to Satan</hi> by the power of Christ; which is <hi>proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly answerable to the taking away by death</hi>: which in Israel, themselves grant, was to be doon <hi>by the hands of the people.</hi> Thus doo the Elders now chalenge by proportion in the Church, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed both to Magistrates and people in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. But because they fear the <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 5.26.</note> people, they shape them this deceitful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that their <hi>avoyding the excommunicate person,</hi> is the executing (or <hi>putting in execution,</hi> as they ambiguously speak) of the sentence: answerable to the peoples stoning of a malefactor in Israel; how fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let al that have understanding judge. For whether the people avoid him or not, the man is judged and delivered to Satan, and so cut off from the church: as on the contrary, when one is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the minister, whether the people keep company with him or not, he is made a member of the church: and as a man behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Israel, was surely dead, whether the people refreyned from touching him or no. 2. Agayn they give no more to the people of that Church wherof he is a member, then to the people of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches, that are bound to avoid the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated person, as wel as they. 3. Yea they give hereby their people no more power, then the Pope dooth to his marked servants; for he also wil have the people <hi>avoyd</hi> such as he dooth <hi>exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate</hi>: and if this be the boasted right and libertie of the people, they had as much in the greatest bondage of poperie, as now when they are caried thus blindfold by <hi>propertions.</hi> But they tel the people, <note n="†" place="margin">Advert. pag. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>that if any can except against the Elders proceedings they shalbe heard.</hi> I answer, First before whom and unto whom, shal any man <hi>except against the Elders</hi>: is it not before and unto the Elders themselves? And is it meet that they should be judges in their own cases? In Israel when any complayned of wrong in the Synagogues or Cities, ther was an <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 17.8 9. 2. Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 19.8.10.</note>higher Court to control unruly Elders, and to help the oppressed. But now 2. or 3. Elders in a Church, bearing themselves upon their forged authoritie from Mat. 18.17.20. may be lawless; and who shal let them in their proceedings? Secondly, how should the people except, when by these mens doctrine, they are not bound
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19514:16"/>
to be present at the hearing and deciding of the controversie: wil it not be a just blame upon them, if they except against a matter, which they have not heard discussed? Thirdly, when the party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused shal except against the Elders proceedings, (as commonly he wil doo, for if he acknowledged himself to have synned, he should not need to be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated:) may the people now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to hear the case debated between the Elders and him? nay, they plead in their Treatise on Math. 18. saying, <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>But where hath the Lord appointed a rule of further proceeding, beyond that of the Elders &amp; governours, for hearing the brethrens causes, and judging between a man and his brother? &amp;c.</hi> And agayn, <hi>the Elders also are the Churches officers, &amp;c. so as when they have heard, examined, admonished, and iudged according to the word of God, it is to be estemed as doon by the Lord and the Church &amp;c.</hi> Thus let the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> except what he wil, the judgm<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is at an end, the <hi>Lo: hath doon it,</hi> the <hi>Church hath doon it,</hi> because the <hi>Elders</hi> have doon it: and it must be presupposed, that they have doon it <hi>according to the word of God,</hi> though the man except never so much: and though the scriptures foreshew of judges that were <note n="†" place="margin">Zeph. 3.3.</note>
                     <hi>wolves</hi> not sparing the flock, and latter dayes abundantly confirm the same. And thus when a Naboth is condemned by wicked Elders, if any except on his behalf, they wil <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Next folow their many questions; and other matters imputed unto us: wherein we observ how when arguments fayl them for their own cause, they seek to darken the truth, by casting clowds before the readers eyes. 1. First they ask, <hi>whither in Jsrael the Lord abridged the people of their right and libertie</hi> &amp;c. I answer, No: but these men that by wrested proportions, give the ministers of the church, the power that Magistrates, Preists and people had in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; doe abridge the people of their right, as before is manifested.</p>
                  <p>And for the further clearing of it, seing ther were diverse gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in Israel, as the <note n="‘*’" place="margin">Num. 18.</note> Preists and Levites in the Temple; the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19514:17"/>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 4.20</note>ministers in the synagogues; the <note n="‘†’" place="margin">Deut. 16 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> Elders or Magistrates at the gates of the cities, and these also divers and of unequal power, as before <note n="‘*’" place="margin">pag. 16.</note> is shewed: I ask of them agayn, whither now the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of every church, be proportionable in power and goverment, unto al those governours: and if not unto al, unto which of them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly they ask, <hi>whither the people have any more right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the churches goverment now, then the people of Jsrael had in those dayes.</hi> I answer, they should not seek to intangle by ambiguitie of terms. First, we give not to the people <hi>goverment,</hi> as before <note n="‘†’" place="margin">pag. 10.</note> I have shewed, but a right and power to <note n="‘*’" place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> observ and doo al the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Christ, touching his prophetical preistly and kingly office, by the Elders teaching guiding and governing of them in the Lord. 2. The goverm<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in Israel was diverse, by Magistrates in the gate, by Preists in the sanctuarie, by ministers in the syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. To the Magistracie, al Christians are to be subject <note n="“" place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 13.1.</note> now, as they were then: for it is an <note n="‘†’" place="margin">1. pet. 2.13.</note> humane ordinance, tending to civil peace, and concerneth al men whither within the church or without, indifferently. The external Preisthood of Israel, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in Christ and now abolished, Heb. 7. yet in Davids Kingdom, and Levies preisthood, ther was <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 33.21.22.</note> a figure also of the kingdom and preisthood that <note n="‘*’" place="margin">Rev. 1.6.</note> Christ bestoweth on the saincts. Who have as much more power and libertie in the Gospel now, than the Iewes had; as the heyr when he is of yeres, hath more then in his childhood; <hi>Gal 4.1.2.3.</hi> yet alwayes in order, and with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the ministerial goverment of their <note n="‘*’" place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> Leaders. And I ask of these agayn, whither the Christian Magistrates now, are not to have their voices with the ministers of the church wherof they are, in the admonishing &amp; censuring of synners ecclesiastically, and in other publik questions and controversies of religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly they ask, <hi>Whether the people of Jsrael were not Kings and Preists &amp;c. as wel as the Christian people are now, Exod. 19.5. Psal. 149.1. &amp;c. with 1. Pet. 2.9.10. Rev. 1.6.</hi> I answer, first as touching the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of their external kingdom and preisthood, it is evident, that the Israelites were not so the natural seed of David &amp; of Levi, as Christians now are the spiritual seed of them in Christ, <hi>Jer. 33, 22.</hi> Secondly, for communication with the spiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and preisthood of Christ by them shadowed, the Israelites were Kings and Preists as well as we, but with differences. For Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19514:17"/>
state and ours, are not simply opposed, yet doo they differ in manner &amp; degree. They were Kings and Preists as they were Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and partakers of the Anoynting, and that is, as they were under the nevv Testament. But they were <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 8.8.9. &amp;c.</note> not so under it as we are: neyther are we so under the old Testament as were they. They were heyres of the heavenly things, but as children, and so (as Paul <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 4.2, 3.</note>sayth) <hi>under tutors and governours,</hi> &amp; <hi>in servitude under the rudiments of the world,</hi> until the time appointed of the Father, that is until Christs comming. The scriptures which they quote, doo confirm this. For the promise in Exodus 19.5.6. is legal, <hi>if they kept</hi> Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; as in another place <note n="“" place="margin">Levit. 18.5.</note> 
                     <hi>if they</hi> did his statutes, they should <hi>live by them,</hi> which Paul <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.12.</note> sheweth to be a speech of the law, not of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Now that condition, Israel <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 8 9.</note> kept not, neyther <note n="c" place="margin">Rom 8.3</note> could: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the law, but Christ <hi>hath made us Kings and Preists, Rev. 1.5.6.</hi> and until Christ came, Israel was kept under the law, as under a <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 3.23 24.</note> scholemaster, &amp; had an external preisthood, which could give them no <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 7.11.19.</note> perfection, and therfore is abolished, and our state much bettered, as is shewed at large, <hi>Heb. 12.18, 19, 20.21, 22. &amp;c.</hi> as the prophets also foretold, <hi>Jsa. 61, 5, 6. Jer. 33, 15.—22. Mal. 3.3.4.</hi> &amp; of this estate under the gospel, is the 149. psalm a prophesie, (though in their mesure they then also fulfilled it,) and the place of Peter confirmeth it. Whereunto we may add the testimonie of the Iewes Rabbies touching their estate, vnder that scholemaster of the law. <note n="†" place="margin">Maimon. in Treat. of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the law; ch. 3.</note>
                     <hi>With three crownes</hi> (say they) <hi>was Jsrael crowned: with the the crown of the law, and the crown of the preisthood, and the crown of the kingdom. The crown of the preisthood was bestowed upon Aaron and his seed, Num. 25.13. The crown of the kingdom, was bestowed on David and his seed, Ps. 89.36. The crown of the law, loe it is appointed stablished and confirmed unto all Jsrael, as it is written, Moses co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded vs a law, the inheritance of the congregation of Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Rev. 5.9.10. &amp; 20, 6.</hi> And here I also ask of our opposers, whither the Ministers of the Gospel, be Kings and Preists now, by their office of ministery in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly they ask, <hi>whether the Churches power be not a ministerial
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19514:18"/>
power onely.</hi> I answer, the power it self is <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.4 5.</note> Christs; and so royal or kingly: but al that the Church dooth, is onely to administer that power, under Christ. And I ask of them agayn, whether they think the Elders have the whole power, which Christ hath given to his Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fiftly they ask, <hi>whether the Elders power be not ministerial, under the Lord, in and for the Church.</hi> &amp;c. I answer, an ambiguous questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be answered til it be cleared. First this word <hi>power</hi> is large, and they must shew how they limit it: for by comparing this question with the former, they seem to put al the Churches power into the ministers hand; which I deny. They have also misshapen the proportion of their power from the Magistrates of Israel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have heard; contrary to Christs commandement, <hi>Mat. 20, 25, 26. 1. Pet. 5.3.</hi> Secondly the vvord <hi>ministerial</hi> is also diversly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: in a special sense, the Officers onely are caled <note n="“" place="margin">1. Cor. 4.1.</note>

                  <p>Sixtly they ask, <hi>whither we in the Churches goverment, as the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists in the sacraments would not make them aliens from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth of Jsrael, &amp;c.</hi> I answer, this was in their fourth observation before, and <note n="‘*" place="margin">p. 14.15.</note>there is by me answered, I trust without <hi>absurdity,</hi> or <hi>ungodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, errors</hi> or <hi>evils,</hi> all which they here insinuate against us, for to fyll up their mesure.

                  <p>They say, <hi>some of us taught it to be the whole church, alleging to that end Num. 15.33. &amp; 27.2. and 35.12..</hi> I answer, first, we taught then no otherweise then as them selves taught heretofore with us. Secondly we alleged many other scriptures and reasons both <note n="*" place="margin">Ruth. 4.9.11. Ps. 149.6.—9. Ier. 26.11.12.16. Mat. 18.18.—20. &amp; 28.20.

For hereupon they thus argue, <hi>1 Jf this rule be found in the book of Numbers &amp;c. then it is not a new rule first given in Mat. 18.17.</hi> I answer, they wrong us, and would deceiv the reader: we alleged not those scriptures to prove the rule to be the same then and now; but to give light unto the question, by shewing what was the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples right then, under the law, and under the Magistrate: which may be more, but can not be less now under the gospel, where the church ministery, hath not <note n="†" place="margin">Math. 20.25.26. 1.

                  <p>Then they say, <hi>those scriptures speak of civil goverment, which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept about the Elders, but they suppose we wil not give to the people civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</hi> I answer, first them selves grant that the people have as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19514:19"/>
much right and power now as they had in Israel: but we deny, &amp; they can never prove that the ministers now have as much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the people, as had the Princes of Israel: so our reasoning is good, though theirs be naught. Secondly for <hi>civil authoritie</hi> as we never chalenged it: so neyther should it be objected to them, but that they wil have it to be no <hi>new rule.</hi> Then say we, it must be left to the Magistrate, and ministers may not intrude into their place. And seing they thus urge it, let them, if they please, clear them selves, whither they think not that the Elders of the church, may have civil authoritie also, as had the Elders in Israel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly they say, that by these and the like scriptures <hi>it is certayn, sinners in Jsrael were brought before the congregation of Elders.</hi> I answer, if they mean Elders onely, (as they must if they reason to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand,) I deny it: and ther is no weight in their proof. For, it is also certayn that Paul imposed hands on Timothee, <hi>2. Tim. 1.6.</hi> but elswhere it appeareth, others also imposed hands as wel as he. <hi>1. Tim. 4.14.</hi> So, the Apostles and Elders came togither about a controversie, <hi>Act. 15.6.</hi> but the <hi>whole Church</hi> came togither also, verse <hi>22.23.</hi> Titus was left <hi>to ordeyn Elders, Tit. 1.5.</hi> but was he to doo it, himself alone? The <hi>keyes</hi> were promised to Peter, <hi>Mat. 16.19.</hi> but were they meant to him onely? In <hi>Rev. 2.1.</hi> Iohn wrote <hi>to the Angel</hi> (or <hi>Messenger) of the church</hi>: but by <hi>Rev. 1.11. &amp; 2.7.</hi> it is plain the whole church was intended. So in Israel, the law sayth in a case of mariage, <hi>let her goe up to the gate to the Elders: Deut. 25.7.8.9.</hi> but the practise of this sheweth, that <hi>the people</hi> were also interested with the Elders, <hi>Ruth. 4.2.7.9.11. Jn Exod. 5.1. Moses and Aaron</hi> went to Pharaoh, but by <hi>Exod. 3.18.</hi> we may gather that the Elders of Israel went with them also. So in the place cited <hi>Num. 15.33. they brought him to Moses and to Aaron, and to al the Congregation</hi>; the people are here meant with the Magistrates, for God then sayd, <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>let al the congregation stone him</hi>; and <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>al the Congregation</hi> brought him without the host and stoned him. Now by M. Iohnsons own grant, they whom the Iudges condemned, did dye <note n="†’" place="margin">Treat. on Mat. 18. p. 19.</note> by the hands of the people: who is it then that cannot see, the <hi>Congregation</hi> here to mean both Elders and people? So in the other place, <hi>Num. 27.2.</hi> when they stood <hi>before Moses, and Eleazar the preist, and before the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and al the Congregation,</hi> this distribution of the persons, togither with the place, the <hi>dore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation</hi>; may shew
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19514:20"/>
that the Elders onely were not meant: besides in the same chapter, Iosua being there ordeyned over the <hi>Congregation</hi> &amp;c. it cannot with any colour be gathered, that the Elders onely were the <hi>congregation, Num. 27.16.17.19.20.</hi> &amp;c. Wherfore when one scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth the <hi>Elders, Jos. 20.4.</hi> and an other the <hi>Congregation Num 32.12. Jos. 20.6.</hi> we should not restreyn it to the lesser, but let the scripture have the largest sense, unless apparant reason doo urge a restreynt, which is not here, but the contrary. For if they were to dye <hi>by the hands of the people,</hi> conscience required the people, to hear their cause tryed also, seing the law charged every one, <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 23.7</note> 
                     <hi>thou shalt not slay the innocent and the righteous</hi>: and it was not safe for them to trust their Iudges, which so often and so many wayes corrupted judgment <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 1.23. 1. Sam. 8.3. Zeph. 3.3.</note>as al the prophets doo complayn. It is therfore an evil argument to say, in Israel by one scripture men were sent to the Elders, &amp; by an other to the Congregation, therfore it was the congregation of Elders, and not of the people also. For by such wrested reasons, one might prove that the Elders onely were bound to keep the passover, because in one place it is sayd, speak <hi>to all the Congregation</hi> of Israel, that every man take to him a Lamb, <hi>Exod. 12, 3.</hi> and in an other place it is sayd, Moses caled <hi>al the Elders</hi> of Israel, saying chuse out &amp; take for every of your howsholds a Lamb; <hi>Exod. 12, 21.</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was meant of the <hi>Congregation of Elders,</hi> and so the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not bound to this service. Agayn, it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 19, 3, 5. tel the children of Jsrael,</hi> if ye wil hear my voice and keep my covenant, ye shalbe my chief treasure &amp;c. afterwards it is sayd, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>caled</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 19.7.</note> 
                     <hi>for the Elders of the people,</hi> and proposed unto them al these things: shal we now conclude, therfore the covenant was made with the Elders onely? Who seeth not the weaknes of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: and that it is usual in scripture, to name but the principal of a company, and yet to include others with them? Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding between Israel and us, there were two mayn differences, the one, that Church ministers now, have not such ecclesiastical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie over the people, as is proportionable to the Magistrates auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie then: for this is forbidden, <hi>Mat. 20, 25.</hi> vvher Christ sayth, <hi>the rulers of the nations have domination over them, and they that are great exercise authoritie over them: but it shal not be so among you.</hi> And <hi>1. Pet. 5.2, 3. Feed the flock of God</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not as having domination over (his) heritage.</hi> The other is, that they vvere a national Church, &amp; the Magistrats
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19514:20"/>
in the gates of Ierusalem, the Preists in the Temple, being for the whole Realm; it could not be that al the people should be present at the dayly judgements of the Magistrates, or sacrifices of the <hi>Preists.</hi> And therfore it vvas not required so of them; as novv it is of us, vvho are but particular Churches, to be present at al publik administration of Christs kingdom and preisthood. Yea even in their most solemn assemblies, they could not doo, as vve ar bound to doo. For they did eat the passeover <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 22.10 11.12. &amp;c.</note> in their private hovvses, because al the thovvsands of Israel could not eat it in one room: but vve are bound to eat the passover now (I mean the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) in <note n="†" place="margin">1. Cor. 11 20. &amp;c.</note> the publik Church, and not otherwhere.</p>
                  <p>Wheras therfore they next except, <hi>that the people were 600. thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, and would we have them to think that they came togither to hear examine and judge the cases of syn &amp;c.</hi> I answer, no: neyther al the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For I have before shevved, there were divers officers, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral causes. And Boaz took but <note n="*" place="margin">Ruth. 4.2.</note> ten of the Elders of Bethlehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hear his cause. The Elders also did meet by themselves as ther was occasion: and so are <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 21.18</note> they to doo now. Secondly for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of so many thowsands in the wildernes, that could not come to hear and judge: they should mind how the same lyeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the execution. When God sayd of the blasphemer, <note n="*" place="margin">Levit. 14.14.</note> 
                     <hi>let all the Congregation stone him</hi>: wil they say six hundred thowsand men came together to doo it? yet themselves grant this vvas to be doon <hi>by the people.</hi> It vvas as easy for them to come to hear his cause tryed, as to come and stone him: and care of equity taught them to doo the first, as vvel as the last, as before is shevved.</p>
                  <p>Next they except against our expounding the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven, Mat. 18.1. &amp;c.</hi> to be the <hi>church under the gospel, since Christ</hi>: this they say <hi>is not sound,</hi> because <hi>the same phrase is spoken of the church of the Jewes, Mat. 22.2.</hi> &amp;c. I answer; this their reason is unsufficient, for I could so except against the exposition almost of any scripture, by shewing a diverse use and meaning of the words. When th'Apostle proveth Christs excellencie above the Angels, because <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 1.4.5</note> of his <hi>name, the Son</hi> of God: the Iewes might allege, that the Angels are also caled <note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 1.6. &amp; 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Sonns of God,</hi> yea holy <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 14.1.</note> men have the like title: but were this a sufficient answer? Wel, I wil not st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ive with them, about the phrase (although in some places they may see the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> opposed to the state of the Iewes church, as <hi>Mat. 11.11</hi>) but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19514:21"/>
as the prophets tel us of <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 65 17 &amp; 66.22. 2. Cor. 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>new heavens</hi> under the Gospel, so wil I distinguish and cal the Iewish church the <hi>old heaven,</hi> (as that which is <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 12.26.27.</note> shaken and removed,) and the Christian church the <hi>new heaven</hi>; of which the Gospel usually speaketh, as <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, Mat. 3.2. &amp; 4.17.</hi> Now vvhen the disciples asked Iesus, <note n="†’" place="margin">Mat. 18, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> ther might be reason of their demand touching the Christian church then to be planted: but to ask such a thing about the Ievvish church; I see litle reason. They knevv already the state of it, and vvho vvas cheif therin. Secondly Christs ansvver leadeth us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for ther being great expectation of that Kingdom, and an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous persuasion that it should be a glorious vvorldly state, Christ tells them the contrary, that it vvas for the <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 3, 4.</note> converted and humble sovvles to enter into: that many scandals and offenses should arise herein, both from <note n="؛*" place="margin">v. 7.</note> the vvorld, and from mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <note n="‘.’" place="margin">v. 8.</note> in them selves, and from <note n="*" place="margin">v. 15. &amp;c.</note> their brethren. Against al vvhich he armeth his disciples, and teacheth the orderly vvay to redress them. And that his rules should not be despised, he assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them that their censures executed on earth, shalbe ratified <note n="‘{inverted †}’" place="margin">v. 18.</note> in heaven: the ground vvherof is his <note n="*’" place="margin">v. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>name</hi> vvherin they should be gathered togither, and his presence in the mids of them.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19514:22"/>
this matter: namely that the whole church of men women &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be present at ecclesiastical judgments, as at al other publick administrations of the church, wher whatsoever is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is doon <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 6.4.</note> by <hi>prayer and the ministration of the word,</hi> that al may receiv instruction by the word there ministred, and as is written <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 13.11. &amp; 17.13.</note> al Israel may hear and fear and doo no more any such wickednes. But no other to have voices or suffrages in excommunications &amp;c. then they that have voices in election or deposition of officers. And they know wel, it was never our judgment or practise, that in Elections women or children should <hi>give their voices,</hi> the <note n="‘.’" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.34.</note> Apostle and nature it self requiring women to be <hi>silent</hi> in the church: they also themselves have thus professed and practised with us many yeres. Secondly they have seen Mr. Robinsons answer <note n="‘؛’" place="margin">Iustisic. p. 204.205.206.</note> to M. Bernard (cavilling likewise about <hi>women and children,</hi>) to the same effect. Yet wil they take no notice of his answer, or of ours; nor make any reply, but thus trouble the world, and us in special, to answer agayn and agayn whatsoever they please to demand. For after in pag. 43. of their book, they are twise up agayn with these questions of <hi>women and children,</hi> as if we had nought ells to doo, but to answer and answer their tautologies. Thirdly seing they thus deal, to make the truth seem odious, and to set the more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour upon their prelacie, imitating the papists and popish affected, they shal have the like things demanded of them, not by us, but by others.

                     <hi>to give voices in election is not a part of government, but a power right and libertie that the saincts and people out of office have and should use.</hi> Now those of the prelates faction which deny this power of the people, say thus unto them; <note n="*" place="margin">D.

                     <hi>By this reckning men women and children (for al the faithful be interested) shal have voices in election of their ministers; if any dissent, al must be dashed. Jt had been very requisite that our authour for the appointing of these Democratical elections the better unto vs, should with proof out of scripture for every particular have shewed whether wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or children of some reasonable discretion, should have voices in election of their Minister? whether he should be chosen by all, by the greater part, or by the better part? whether the wives voice should be accounted several, or but one with her husband, or whether she might dissent from her husband, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the son? &amp;c.</hi> They that compare these two writers, may see how they wrote by one spirit, and almost with one pen. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19514:22"/>
in this point of <hi>popular election</hi> they doo differ: wee leave it for our opposites to answer these demands to the Prelates; and then if need be, they shal hear further of us, touching <hi>popular exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <hi>the hands of al the people to stone</hi> a wicked man; and ask, whether <hi>women</hi> also and <hi>children</hi> must be present &amp; cast stones: he might have as good colour for his question as have these, if not better. For these say, <note n="†" place="margin">Treat. on Mat. 18. p. 19.</note>
                     <hi>in Jsrael, such as would not hearken to the Preists &amp; judges, were to dye by the hands of the people</hi>: and the proportion that they cast for the people now, is <note n="“" place="margin">Advertis. pag. 34.</note> that they shal <hi>put the sentence in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, by avoiding the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated persons.</hi> Now, I think, they wil have <hi>women</hi> yea and <hi>children</hi> also, to <hi>avoyd exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated persons</hi>; so then by proportion, <hi>women</hi> &amp; <hi>children</hi> in Israel must cast stones at malefactors. Yea this may be further urged against them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a pregnant <hi>note</hi> which they give in their <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 8.9.</note> Treatise on <hi>Mat. 18</hi> that that is such a church, as where <hi>women may speak &amp; are to be heard in their cases and pleas as wel as men,</hi> but, <hi>it is not permitted to women to speak in the Churches of the saincts, &amp;c.</hi> wher eyther they aequivocate with this word <hi>speak,</hi> using it in divers senses, (a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon <note n="†" place="margin">Aristot. in reprehens.

For if women are to do <hi>execution</hi> now, why not then also?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now wheras they intimate to the reader, as if we vvould have al men <hi>examine, rebuke, admonish</hi> in the presence of the Elders; they doo but labour the disgrace of the holy order in the church: wher the Minister as the mouth of the congregation, propoundeth exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth and carieth matters: and then the people if there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or default, may speak in due order, but if in matter or manner they transgress, they are to bear their rebuke. Al things in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick judgments of the church being caried holily, peaceably and by the government of the Elders, even as in elections of officers, in prophesie, or any other thing wherin men have libertie for to speak. And when the Ministers cary things well, we commonly find it as in Act. 15.12. that <hi>al the multitude keepeth silence</hi>: otherwise strife (and sometime disorder) dooth often arise, by the evil deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Elders. 6. It is also to be observed how these our opposites wil require by their proportion from Israel, children
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19514:23"/>
to stone their parents, wives their husbands, and servants their maysters, by avoiding their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion: yet wil they not have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be of that church which is to hear, examine &amp; judge of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses why their parents, &amp;c. should be stoned and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated; not bound to be present at the trial of their case? Did ever any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth in the world require such <hi>execution</hi> at the hands of wives children and servants; and yet teach them so little to honour and regard their parents, as not to think themselves bound to hear their case tried, but upon the Elders report, to stone their own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, husbands, maisters, which doo take it on their death that they are innocent?</p>
                  <p>Against <hi>1. Cor. 12.21.—26.</hi> which was by some alleged, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>1. that the Apostles purpose is not to speak of cases and pleas about syn, and of the manner of dealing therin: but of the diversity of gifts and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, given for the help and service of all, to the building up of the body of Christ.</hi> I answer; 1. the Apostle speaketh generally of the <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.6.</note> 
                     <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities of gifts, Ministeries, and operations</hi> in the church, as they are given to <hi>to</hi>

                     <hi>gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> or <hi>governments</hi>: and ther is no church action, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle purposeth not in that his dispute to comprehend: their first exception therfore is not true. 2. Neyther dooth it agree with it self: for if he speak (as they confess) of <hi>the diversity of gifts and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given for the help and service of all, to the building up of the body of Christ</hi>: then can he not but speak of <hi>cases and pleas about syn</hi>: seing they are to be judged by the <hi>gifts and functions</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1.

Ephe. 4.12. —16.</note> build up the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ.

Would we <hi>inferr,</hi> that the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of syn should be brought to infants newly baptised; because we say, not the Elders onely but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19514:23"/>
the church is to judge, as <note n="†" place="margin">Cor. 5.12</note> Paul teacheth? And would th'Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle also <hi>inferr</hi> (think they) that infants should <hi>rebuke</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, because he sayth, <note n="*" place="margin">1.

                     <hi>al Jsrael stoned him</hi>? we had not thought wise men would ever have made such inferences. And what vveight is in their reasoning from infants? that if other besides Elders may judge synners, then infants: if not infantes, then no other but Elders. Might not men thus elude al Pauls arguments? As when he sayth <note n="†" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.7.</note> 
                     <hi>the manifestation of the spirit is given to every one to profit withal</hi>; they to conclude, therfore the yongest children newly baptised can mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the spirit to the profit of others. <hi>We have bene</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly they except that this similitude, <hi>might likewise be applied to Jsrael</hi>: which we grant. Also we acknowledge that it may not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then or now <hi>pervert Gods ordinance about the Elders hearing &amp;c.</hi> They say, <hi>the governours are set in the Church for that use</hi>: I answer, not the governours onely: this is that which they should prove. They are to govern the Church in al actions, but not to doo them alone. Also they say, <hi>al members have not fit gifts for examining of persons, deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of questions &amp;c.</hi> I answer, that is true, for infants (as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,) have not. But that onely the Elders have fit gifts for such purposes, is untrue: the <note n="‘*" place="margin">Act. 25.22.—25.</note> scripture, and dayly experience tells us the contrary: yea some other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers may have fitter gifts then the Elders. And they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves that now are officers, had they not gifts fit to examine judge decide &amp;c. before they were chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into office: or did their election give them gifts, which had none fit before?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, they wil have <hi>this scripture direct against us; in that it sheweth how some have a more cheif place then others, as the head and eyes &amp; hands in the body.</hi> This is not against us at all, for we grant so much. But they say <hi>we litle regard it, who in cases of controversie wil look where the greatest number of people is, (though they may be of the most simple) and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19514:24"/>
wil have them to be the church, and to have the power &amp;c. as if the multitude should stil be folowed, and that ther were no difference of gifts, of office, or other respect at al to be had.</hi> I answer, 1. they keep their wont, in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us before the world: we look not in any case to the <hi>greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> eyther of <hi>people</hi> or Elders: but in al cases we look to Gods law and testimonie as we are <note n="†" place="margin">Isa. 8.20.</note> commanded; vvhich vvhen it is shevved by vvhom soever, al ought to yeild unto. We knovv neyther the <hi>multitude,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 23.2</note> neyther yet the <hi>mightie</hi> or Rabbies are <hi>stil to be folowed</hi>; there are <hi>differences of gifts and offices</hi> in the church, yet no mans <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>office</hi> (no not though he vvere <note n="؛;؛" place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>an Angel</hi> from heaven,) may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us from the vvritten vvord, by vvhich the Godly people tried e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Apostles doctrine, <note n="‘†’" place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> and vvere commended. Although therfore the Church hath that libertie vvhich al societies (that have none to exercise dominion or authoritie over them) have, namely that the greater number overswayeth the lesser, when al accord not: yet the faithful are not so to look unto or folow the greater number, as to decline from the least of Gods commandements. This we may see in the 12. tribes of Israel, where the greater nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, even ten of the tribes fel to false worship, and they caried away with them, not onely the tribute of <note n="a" place="margin">2 King. 3.4. Isa. 16.1. 2. Sam. 8.2.</note> two hundred thowsand lambs and ramms, which were due yerely from Moab to the Kings of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, &amp; were wrongfully chalenged and taken by the Kings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria: but caried away also the title of the Church, being usually even by al the Prophets <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 3.8. Ilos. 4.15. 1. King. 12.19. &amp; 15.9.16.17. &amp;c. 2 Chron. 10 16, 17. &amp;c.</note> named <hi>Jsrael,</hi> wheras Iudah and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min were Israel as wel as Ephraim and the rest, yea in deed they were the onely Israel of God, as the scripture <note n="c" place="margin">Ps. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>3.1. &amp; 125.5. Gal. 6.16. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 9.4.6.</note> counteth Israel. Yet did not the faithful respect this greater number, but left <note n="†" place="margin">2. Chron. 11.16.</note> them with their title, and usurpation, and went to the lesser part which was the better.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But is it not strange that these our opposites wil object these things to us; when in some things they doo the same, and in their new establisht hierarchie much worse? For in their popular electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of officers (which they stil allow, if it may continue,) must not the greater number of voices cary the thing? And yet there is no action of the church, that needeth more wisdom, government or circumspection then this. And therfore many precepts are left for the careful and holy performance of it, <hi>1. Tim. 3. &amp; 5. Tit. 1.</hi> And wil not the Papists now cast the reproches on their own faces, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19514:24"/>
they that would have <hi>the multitude stil folowed,</hi> as if there were <hi>no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of gifts &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And touching their hierarchie the Eldership they wil not I think deny, but the greater number of voices among them must prevayl. Now that being so, a Church having a Pastor, and a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that are learned, and 3. or 4. ruling Elders, which are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned as the other of the people, taken of trades men and the like: these 3. or 4. Rulers (whose power they have proportioned with the Princes of Israel,) shal by their number of voices cary matters, though it be against Pastor, Teacher, and 500 brethren. Yea these may excommunicate or depose the Pastor and Teacher, and cast out of the brethren: but none can excommunicate them, or depose them joyntly from their offices. The utmost that we can find these men to allow <note n="*" place="margin">In their Treat. on Mat. 18. p. 25.</note> the Church in these exigents, is when they have doon al they can, <hi>to separate</hi> from them: and this power any man hath in the church of Rome.

For by this manner of reasoning the Elders as the head, have al the wit, and the people as the hands and feet, have none at al. The Elders as the eyes, see al things: but the people see no more then the ears. For if the people have some understanding and insight into matters as wel as the Elders, why should they not be used also in consulting and determining publick things which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern al. Vnless the Elders now have such abundance of wisdom, as they can afford ynough to al, and need supply from none. But the scripture tells the contrary, saying, <hi>who is sufficient for these things? 2.

David <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 119.99.100.</note> by Gods precepts: &amp; what if the Elders be <hi>blind guides</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 15.14</note> Christ caleth some, &amp; <hi>without understanding,</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 56.11</note>as the prophet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? Then men must leav the blind Eldership, and goe to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent brethren, and they must consult and determine, yea without the Elders, if these men say true. Doe not these things manifest how they have wrested the similitude? 2. Secondly, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect against the Apostles meaning: who because of dissentions in the church of Corinth, sheweth <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 12</note> by that similitude of a body, that the chiefest members have need of the inferiour, and the head <note n="d" place="margin">verse 21.</note> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say to the feet I have no need of yow: but now the Elders can say to the people, we need not your help to judge and determine questions and controversies, this gift and duty is ours; neyther are yow bound to be present to hear and decide publick causes; but when we have judged, you shal <hi>execute</hi> our judgments. And if the people agayn should say to the Elders when they are about choise of officers, we need not your help, or counsel: you are not bound to be present when we doo this busynes; the feet have no more need of the eyes to goe, then the eyes have of the feet to see. Were not this to make <hi>a division in the body,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">verse 25.</note>which th'Apostle there condemneth. 3. Moreover, it is vayn to think that any officer or brother in the Church should so be one special member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as that he cannot be an other. The Prophets in Israel were <note n="*" place="margin">1. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 9.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Seers,</hi> and so in sted of <hi>eyes</hi> in the head: but when they <note n="“" place="margin">La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2.14.</note> looked out vayn things, then as the Lord saith, <hi>the Prophet that taught lies, was the tayl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jsa. 9.15.</hi> The Elders, by directing the church in the right way, are as <hi>eyes</hi> to the body; by administring the sacraments and censures, they are as <hi>hands</hi>; when they are sent on the Churches message, they are as <hi>feet</hi>; when they reprove synns, they are as the <hi>mouth,</hi> when they are reproved for their synns, they should be as <hi>ears</hi>; and so other Christians in their places and imployments. And as God hath bestowed his graces upon any, so is he to be regarded of al, without respect of person: neyther should the Elders be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like Achitophel <note n="“" place="margin">2.

the city. Was she in this action, a part of the foot, or of the hart and head in that body, may we think? 4. Finally, this their reasoning is one with the Iesuits, that exclude the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church affayrs. <hi>The Church</hi> (sayth <note n="d" place="margin">De sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in gen. l. 1. c. 25.</note> Bellarmine) <hi>bindeth and looseth, but by their Prelates, not by whomsoever: even as the body speaketh, but by the tongue, not by the hand.</hi> Thus dooth the Cardinal answer M.

And is not this agayn to divide the body, when the head must be present, and the showlders with the other parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may be absent? The Apostle writing to the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, how to doo when <note n="†" place="margin">1.

And if they answer, they are bound to assemble for to excommunicate him, but not to hear him by the word convinced in the trial of his cause; they may as wel teach the people they are bound to come to eat the bread and wine in the Lords supper, but not bound to hear the word teaching and preparing them here unto.

Wheras Christ there enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth to his disciples of all nations to the worlds end <hi>the observing of all things whatsoever he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded th'Apostles.</hi> And excommunication was one of those

things commanded, <hi>Mat. 18. 1. Cor. 5.</hi> Therfore to be observed by a Christian people though they want officers, unless these men can shew some prohibition. Christ requireth to observ <hi>al things</hi>; these men say, nay, not excommunication: it lyeth now, on them to shew wher Christ or his Apostles have excepted <hi>excommunication.</hi> But from that place, and by the very same reasons, doo the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists deny baptisme of Children, caling for scripture, example, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, &amp; ground to warrant it, as these doo now in this case.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, besides al things heretofore written, they have a ground in the article it self, which they neyther doo nor can take away; which is the power that the church alwayes hath <hi>to receiv in</hi> members: and therfore consequently to <hi>cast them out</hi> agayn if they deserv it. Which ground if they deny, they in effect deny that ther can be any church without Elders, contrary to the express scripture <hi>Act. 14.23. 1. Cor. 12.28. Tit. 1.5.</hi> Yea or that ther can be any visible Christians without Elders: for how can they be Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians without <note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 15.1.2.3.4.</note> union with Christ? And if men cannot be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his members and body, because ther wanteth Elders, how should they be united with him the head? 4. They have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a point of false doctrine by Mr Iohnson himsef, to teach <hi>that the Church of Christ hath not alwayes power to receive in and to cast out by the keyes of the kingdom.</hi> Answer to M. Iakob, pag. 159.160.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They secondly allege <hi>sundry examples</hi> &amp; <hi>grounds that it hath been doon by the Lord himself and by his officers,</hi> &amp;c. This we never doubted of, but a Church having officers may exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. Though yet the proof for the Elders wilbe excepted against by the Prelates and such like. For, th'examples of Abraham, of Paul, of Titus, of Timothee, and of the Preist judging a leper, make rather in show for one Bishop, then for a Church of Elders: and so are alleged by Papists, for the Prelacie. The other scriptures doo none of them shew the Elders power to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, but to watch, take heed, reprove, admonish &amp;c, al which the Prelates grant to their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Preists: whom yet they wil not suffer to excommunicate, with out the Bishop or his Official, as these wil not the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Eldership. The examples of excommunicating by the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Israel, I wil turn against them thus: If the Magistrates and people of Israel might not onely punish civilly with death, but also execute a spiritual censure of <hi>excommunication</hi> upon the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19514:28"/>
of evil doers, though they had wanted ministers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and synagogues: then a Christian magistrate and people may doo so now, though they want ministers ecclesiastical. And if the Church may excommunicate having a magistrate, it may also do it wanting one: seing the power of spiritual censure dependeth <note n="*" place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3, Thirdly they wil have us <hi>to consider how a people can chalenge the ministration of excommunication, more then of the sacraments &amp;c.</hi> This we have considered, and find that if the reason be good, the ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may not excommunicate, any more then minister the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: which whither they hold or no, let them tel us in their next. For they know wel, the Prelates object these things against the ruling Elders, as themselves doo now against the people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly they say, <note n="*" place="margin">In Treat. Mat. 18. p. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>they cannot find in scripture but when the church is caled the body of Christ, or compared to a body, howse, city or kingdom: it is spoken eyther of particular Churches having officers, or of the catholik church, in respect of Christ the head &amp;c.</hi> I answer, it appeareth then plainly, they have lost that which they had found; and let them take heed least for not <note n="†" place="margin">1.

Ther opinion is injurious not onely to Christians, but to Christ himself; whiles they wil not grant him being the corner stone, the head, the king; and the faithful, the living stones his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p n="5">5. Fiftly they say, <hi>our controversie was about a Church established with officers</hi>: &amp; <hi>things concerning people without officers, are left to further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> I answer, true it is, they sought alwayes to hide their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and to put off things which pressed them, to further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the Elders having gott the Churches power into their hands, they lysted not to scan the peoples right. But we were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily drawn to controvert this point two wayes: first because their errour did eat out the very constitution of the Church wherof they vvere, as shal after be manifested. Secondly because it vvas by themselves acknovvledged that vvhatsoever povver the people hav before; is not to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by their officers; this therfore vvas an argument that manifested the evil vvhich lurketh in their nevv doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And vvho can soundly discuss any question, if they look not to the foundation; as Christ sayd to the Pharisees, <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 19.8.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Finally, vvheras vve shevved hovv their doctrine <hi>overthroweth the constitution of their Church</hi>; as being vvithout povver from Christ, they say, <hi>First it were worth the knowing by whom the first man or two
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19514:29"/>
men of this church were received in, and by what power.</hi> I ansvver, it is true they say; and pray them therfore to shevv by vvhat povver their church began, if they vvould have men acknovvledge it for true, and planted by the povver of Christ Othervveise they must renounce their estate, and begin a nevv. As for ours, it is shevved in our published vvritings, vvhich if they can, let them disprove; as, in <hi>Treat. of the ministerie,</hi> against M. Hildersh. p. 73.74. Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, p. 44.45.46.47.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly they say, <hi>by our baptisme, as also by accord in the truth, we ar bound to communion in any thing lawful, as God giveth occasion and opportunity.</hi> I answer; 1. they here turn from the question: we speak of <hi>constitution</hi> of a particular church, they tel us of <hi>communion</hi> by <hi>baptism and accord in the truth</hi>; which extendeth to al churches in the world, and to Saincts that ar not gathered and constituted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any particular church. We speak of a <hi>church with power to receiv in and cast out, though it have no officers</hi>: they touch not this point, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they closely grant us the question, to the overthrow of their opinion. For if they yeild such power and practise, to be <hi>a lawful thing in the communion of al such as ar baptised, or doo accord in the truth</hi>; they refute themselves: if not, al men may see how they seek to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert from the matter in hand. 2. Secondly by <hi>their baptism,</hi> they mean not onely the true baptisme in Christs church, <hi>but the false</hi> baptisme in Antichrists, as the article expresseth, and after we ar to scan: which if it be according to the scriptures which they cite, the <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4.4.5. 1. Cor. 10.1.2. &amp; 12, 13.</note>
                     <hi>one baptisme,</hi> that <hi>by one spirit baptiseth al into one body</hi>; then are they returned into the <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunion</hi> and <hi>body</hi> of Antichrists synagogue, (if the church of Rome be it,) &amp; are <hi>bound</hi> to communicate even with Friers and Iesuites <hi>in any thing lawful as God giveth occasion,</hi> and that is, I suppose, to hear them when they preach nothing but the truth, or to pray with them, when they in spirit pray to God in Christ &amp;c. I would be loth to wrong them, their own <note n="*" place="margin">Treat. on Mat. 18. p. 26.</note> words lead me to this, if I gather amyss let them pardon me, &amp; shew their meaning plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for, <note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 3, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>he that dooth truth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the light.</hi> 3. Thirdly, without baptisme there may be a Church entred into covenant with God &amp; one with an other: as all Israel <note n="“" place="margin">Deut. 29.10,—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. They thirdly say, <hi>it is playn and undenyable that to chuse or give voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19514:30"/>
in election, is not a part of goverment &amp;c. but an interest power, right and libertie, that the Saincts out of office have and should use &amp;c.</hi> I answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First this is <hi>playn and undenyable,</hi> so long as it pleaseth them not to deny it: but if they change their mind in this point to morow, as they have doon in the former about the peoples power to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, then we shal hear, as we did before, <hi>wher find we in the scriptures that God hath thus layd on the people without officers to make electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? where is the precept for it? which be the examples of it? &amp;c.</hi> They tel us it is <hi>playn</hi>; but not one scripture is brought to shew it: yet is it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, seing they know the Papists and other Prelates deny such electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without officers. The Prelates wil shew them sundry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, wher it was doon by the counsel, direction and government of officers, as <hi>Act. 1.15.21, 22. &amp; 6.2, 3. &amp; 14, 23, 1. Tim. 3, 1.— 14.15. Tit. 1.5.</hi> but not one place where a people without officers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted such a work. Wherefore wee wish our opposites not to deal so slenderly, as to tel men it is <hi>playn and undeniable,</hi> &amp; so to leav it: for we make no doubt, but the sound proof of this point, wil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proov their former errour. 2. Secondly, we have upon their bare word, that <hi>to give voices</hi> in election of officers is no <hi>part of government</hi>: we pray them in their next to shew, whether then to <hi>give voices</hi> for deposition of unworthy officers, be a part of government; as also how they prove that to give voices for the reciving in, and putting out of members in the Church, is a <hi>part of government,</hi> more than the other. 3. Thirdly the reader may observ their covert cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of this point, whiles they speak but of <hi>giving voices in election</hi>: but what say they about <hi>giving power of administration</hi> to the ministers: who must doo that? or how had these men that, but by the people? And if the people have power in the name of Christ, to say to the elected Pastor, <hi>Take thou authority to preach the word</hi> &amp;c. or in any other terms to give him pastoral office which had none before; I hope they wil not deny but if that Pastor afterward proov a <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20.29</note> Wolf, the same people may put him out of al his pastoral office: and if they have that power, why also may they not put him quite out of the fold and Church by the power of Christ, that is, excommunicate him? And if it be not lawful for a people to give authority of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie unto a man: how then do these administer, which renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced some of them their former office and preisthood given by the Prelates, and as private men received a nue caling and ordination:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19514:30"/>
others from private estate, were constituted Elders by the people. Is this Ministerie now from heaven, or from men?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lastly they say, <hi>seing their doctrine overthroweth not the constitution of the Church of Jsrael, nor of the primitive Churches, it cannot therfore over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the constitution of their church, or of any that is accordingly built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets &amp;c.</hi> I answer, this in deed is the surest argument of al: save that it is a fayr begging of the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. For the thing they should prove, is, that their constitution is according to Israel, or Apostolik. For, if Israel or the primitive Churches before they had officers, did or might receiv in and cast out members, and if the people might set up, and depose officers by power from God: then are these mens errors overthrown. If not, but that the thing is unlawful for any then or now so to doo, then is the constitution of their Church overthrown, as that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> did grow up to such estate without power <note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 3.27. Heb. 5.4.</note> from heaven, and they are to let it fal, and be <note n="‘*" place="margin">Mat. 15.13.</note> rooted up, and come to a better (if they can find it) according to the scriptures. Whether therfore our exception, or their defense be more <hi>vayn &amp; frivolous,</hi> (as they speak) let the prudent judge.</p>

The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the 23. Article of our Confession being found true in the churches of Jsrael, and of the Gentlies since Christ: the exception made hereabout can not be of weight against this or any other Church established according to the word of God, as those were, but must be also against those Churches withal.</hi> What to make of this their answer, as yet I cannot tell: my slendernes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth not the depth of it. That the <hi>particulars of that 23. article,</hi> were <hi>found true</hi> in the Churches of God; I doubt not of it: that is the thing we stand for. That <hi>exception should be made</hi> by us <hi>hereabout, against this or any Church, established according to the word of God as these were</hi>: is farr from our thought. What is it then that they have sayd: but an ostentation of the name of <hi>Jsrael,</hi> their mayn colourable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which yet is against them, not for them at all, as our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Apologie sheweth. In Israel the <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 8.9.10.</note>whole Congregation was assembled at the ordination of their ministers, and the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel imposed hands upon them. This rule we folow: but these our opposites wil not allow churches (unless they have ministers before,) to doo thus: they wil rather have their ministerie from the great Antichrist of Rome, (as after shalbe manifested,) for which they have no shew in the scriptures. For did Israel ever take Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian or Babylonian preists to minister in their sanctuary? or did the primitive churches ever take any Bishop of the <note n="†" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.18.19.</note> Antichrists that were in there time, &amp; set them by vertue of their Antichristian or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination over the flock of Christ? why then doo these men so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tel us of <hi>Jsrael</hi> and the <hi>primitive churches,</hi> unless they think their very names would make us afrayd?</p>
                  <p>But they except against <hi>Num. 8.9.10.</hi> saying, <hi>by the children of Jsrael &amp;c.</hi> are <hi>the Elders of Jsrael often meant.</hi> I answer, 1. First this being granted, it disprooveth not our argument; for it may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so used elswhere, and yet not here. When we reason from <hi>Heb. 1.8. O God thy throne is for ever,</hi> to prove Christs Godhead: the Arians object, that Princes and Magistrates are often caled <hi>Gods, Psal. 82. Exod. 21.6.</hi> but is that a sufficient answer? 2. Secondly that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19514:32"/>
which these say, is here true, but not the whole truth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Elders, are meant as principals, but not they to be <hi>al the congregation</hi>: which I thus manifest. The <hi>Levites</hi> now to be ordeyned Ministers, were taken in stead of <hi>al the firstborn</hi> of Israel, and not in stead of the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of the Elders onely: <hi>Num. 3.40.41.</hi> The Levits were now to be offred before the Lord, as a shake offring of the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>Num. 8.11.</hi> being freely given as <hi>a gift of theirs</hi> unto the Lord, to doo the service of the Tabernacle of the congregation, <hi>Num. 18.6. &amp; 8.16.</hi> Al offrings were by those that offred them, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented at the dore of the Tabernacle, with imposition of hands, <hi>Levit. 1. verse. 2.3.4.</hi> &amp;c. For as much therfore as these Levites were offred by al the Congregation (and not the Elders or officers onely,) in sted of their own firstborn: it is evident that not the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers onely, but the other people also are here meant, <hi>Num. 8.10.</hi> the rather also for that before verse. 9. and after verse 11. others besides Elders are intended. 2. Secondly they object, <hi>how should so many hundred thowsand of Jsrael, eyther at once hear, or doo the things there spoken of?</hi> I answer, as wel as they heard and did other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik affayrs in the Tabernacle: unless they think, that al the people never heard or did any thing there. When the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Israel synned, al the Congregation was to bring a sacrifice, <hi>Num. 15.24, 25, 26.</hi> wil they ask how so many <hi>100000.</hi> could doo it? By this reason, nothing at al should ever be doon in Israel by the multitude, eyther for word, prayers, sacrifices &amp;c. And so by their proportion of the Church now, let the people be exempted from word, prayers, sacraments, as wel as from ordination of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and censuring of synners: and let the Eldership be al in al.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly they except, <hi>if it be sayd some did it for the rest: first, who were those some, but the Elders! secondly, under whom did they it, but under the Lord, who set them over the people to minister and govern in his sted</hi>? I answer, first the multitude &amp; not the Elders onely were assembled. Secondly the multitude and not the Elders onely, gave these Levits to the Lord: both these are before proved. Thirdly for the order and manner of giving, Moses governed the action, to him it was sayd, <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 8.7.9.</note>

                     </gap> the multitude brought an oblation for their syn, the <hi>Elders</hi> put their hands on the head of the sacrifice, <hi>Lev. 4.14.15.</hi> Accordingly have wee practised in our ordination of officers (as these our opposites wel know,) some of the cheif of the Church, the ancientest, and fathers of families, imposed hands in name of the rest. Now to their seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I answer, they did it under the Lord, and for the other people. But this wil not satisfy them, for they say they were <hi>over the people to minister and govern in Gods sted, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 20.12. Num. 11.16.—30. Deut. 1.9. — 18. &amp; 16.18. &amp; 17.12. &amp; 19.12, 17. &amp;c,</hi> I answer, admit that al they which imposed hands were governours, (though that cannot be proved, neyther dooth <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy father &amp; mother Exod. 20, 12.</hi> I am sure, shew any such thing:) yet they did not this thing as a work peculiar to their office of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, neyther do any of the scriptures alledged, shew so much, but the contrary may be manifested. For if they did it as <hi>governours,</hi> then was it eyther as governours ecclesiastical and ministers in the sanctuarie: but so were not they, for Aaron and his sonns had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly that charge, Levit. 8. Or they did it as governours civil, &amp; Magistrates of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Which if it be affirmed, then first, Christian Magistrates now (which have civil authoritie equal with the Magistrates of Israel;) may ordeyn and impose hands on church ministers: and so men need not run to Rome to borow a Ministery from Antichrist, as many now doo fansie. Secondly if civil Magistrates may impose hands on Ministers: it wil folow, that the Church wanting Magistrates, may also by the Fathers of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or other fittest members impose hands. For it is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a work tyed to the magistrates office: <hi>1.</hi> because then the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Apostles times wanting Magistrates, could not have had Ministers: but they <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 14. Tit. 1.</note> had, and yet never intruded into the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates office. 2. Because the Magistrates sword and office is not subordinate to Christ as he is mediatour and head of the Church, (for so ther should be no lawful magistrates but Christians &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church:) but Magistrates have their office next under <note n="‘*" place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 13.1.</note> God, to be <note n="‘†" place="margin">Iob. 12.24.</note> heads of the Common weales (whether they be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the church <note n="“" place="margin">Act. 25.11</note> or not,) as Christ hath his office under God to be <note n="*’" place="margin">Eph. 1.22</note> head of the Church: and these two goverments are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, as they neyther may be confounded, neyther doo one take in hand the work peculiarly belonging to another.

Because the works of the civil Magistrates office in Israel, might be performed by hethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s when they ruled over that nation: as appointing of officers, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of controversies, punishment of malefactors &amp;c. So Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar the Babylonian lawfully <note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 27.6..8.12.</note> (as concerning God,) reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Iewes, and did <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 40.5.</note> set over them a governour, and put some of them to death <note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 29.22 23.</note> for adulterie &amp; other evils. And the Iewes were bound to obey him and his substitutes, and to <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 29.7.</note> pray for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. But to the Babylonian Preists they might not be subject. Neyther doo I think that our opposites wil say, Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar and his Princes might give office of Ministerie, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hands on the Levites in the sanctuarie. Wherfore I conclude that the cheif fathers of Israel imposed hands on the Levites, not because of their office of magistracie (if they had such an office,) as if it could not ells have been performed: but because they were the principallest members of the Church, &amp; therfore by order to doo it before al other, and in the name of al other, which for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them could not perform it: which order al churches now are <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.40.</note> bound to keep for ever. And this which I have sayd, the words of the text in their natural sense doo confirm, <note n="†" place="margin">Num. 8.10.</note> 
                     <hi>the sonns of Jsrael shal put their hands upon the Levites</hi>: shewing that they did it not by title of Magistracie, but as Israelites. So also in the other case, when the Elders imposed hands on the syn offring, Levit. 4, 14, 15. it was not a work peculiar to the ecclesiastical Elders: for afterward <note n="††" place="margin">Chron. 29, 23.</note> King Hezekiah with the Congregation layd their hands upon the sacrifices. Which thing also he did not by peculiar right of his kingly office, but as he was principal of the Church of Israel; for when they had no King, the Church might doo it, by the next cheif me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers; &amp; an unbeleeving King reigning over them might not doo it. Also if any people returning from captivity, had wanted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates; they were not deprived therby of offring sacrifice for their publik syn. For if every private man might impose hands on his own sacrifice, as Levit. 1.3.4. how can we think that the whole company synning, the cheif fathers might not have impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hands, according to that rule, Lev. 4.15. Yea the word <hi>Elders</hi>

                  <p>The other things which they allege, about the varietie of phrase, as they doo not disprove the thing forespoken: so make they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them. They say such as <hi>are caled Elders, Lev. 9.1.</hi> are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>children of Jsrael, Lev. 9, 3.</hi> this is true: for who ever doubted but the <hi>Elders</hi> were <hi>sonns of Jsrael</hi> as wel as the other people. But if they bring it to prove the Elders or Officers onely to be there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I deny it: the whole chapter after manifesteth the publick church to be meant. For when Aaron had offred his own <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 8.</note> syn-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring, and <note n="*" place="margin">verse 12.</note>burnt-offring; then offred he the <note n="“" place="margin">verse 15, 16.18.</note>

This was one of the most publik assemblies, and who would ever dream that the Elders onely were here expiated by sacrifice, and blessed of the Preist? they might even as wel say, the Elders onely did keep and eat the passover; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Exod. 12.3.</hi> with <hi>Exod. 12.21.</hi> where one verse sayth <hi>al the congregation,</hi> and an other, <hi>al the Elders.</hi>

                  <p>The next exception of the Septuagints translating <hi>the sonns of Js<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in Greek the <hi>Eldership</hi>: is not of weight, though the translators should have minded as doo their Commenters.

                  <p>Finally they <hi>observ the clauses</hi> in the article, <hi>according to the rules in Gods word,</hi> and <hi>by due order &amp;c. which as they bind them to shew by scriptures, that the people not being in office may choose their officers, as is proved there &amp; in Apol. p. 46.47. so they bind us to shew like rules practise or warrant of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19514:34"/>
ordination, deposition and excommunication.</hi> I answer; first if a man would except as they doo, he might ask them how they prove that people without officers may <hi>by due order choose</hi> any into office: for in the scriptures which they stand upon, al things were doon by the counsel, ordering and goverment of the officers, even the election it self, <hi>Act. 6.2.3. &amp; 1.15.—22. &amp; 14.23. &amp;c.</hi> Secondly their new devise of having their ordination successively fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, is neyther <hi>according to the rules in Gods word,</hi> nor <hi>by due order,</hi> nor by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny example in Israel; no though Rome were as true a church as they now plead her to be. For that the ministers of one particular church should ordeyn officers for an other church, is more unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly then when every church ordeyneth them in it self: the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Evangelists had their offices in al churches, so have not Pastors. Magistrates are limited within their own precincts: and the Maior or Bailive of one corporation, hath no jurisdiction in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. So should al ministers be bounded within their own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and not chalenge catholik authoritie in al churches, as dooth the <note n="†" place="margin">2. Thes. 2 8.</note> 
                     <hi>lawless</hi> usurping man of syn, Antichrist. Thirdly, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and reasons in our Articles and Apologie, serv also for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and deposition of ministers; though it please these men to pass them over in sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, because they are too heavy for them to lift. In our Apologie pag. 43. there are 6. arguments, and in pag. 47. six other arguments confirmed by scriptures, as the reader may see: til our opposites answer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we think it needless to set down more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we hold it necessary that al church actions be orderly caried, eyther by the officers if ther be any, or by the Magistrates as in Israel, or by the Fathers of families, or the most excellent in gifts requested therunto by the congregation: this we firmly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn, against al popular confusion and disorder whatsoever.

                     <hi>that where people first come to the order of Christ, imposition of hands is to be doon by the fittest among them, being therunto appointed by the rest of the church,</hi> alleging <hi>Num. 8.10.</hi> though now he useth for defense of his contrary error, the Iesuites answers.

The 32. article (wherto our Apologie agreeth pag. 52.53.54.) testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that al such as have received any of those false offices (of Lord bishops Preists &amp;c.) are to give over and leave them: and so hath it been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed here before by al such Preists as came to our faith and Church. Now one is Minister over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ordeyned Preist by the Prelates, as is before sayd.</p>
                  <p>The Confirmation of these points in our Apologie (besides the scriptures quoted in our Confession,) is of the one by 8. of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by 12. reasons deduced from many scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto they make these answers. First, that this point <hi>is of like nature with the 2. &amp; 3. here before, where therfore see the answers.</hi> And there also let the reader see our replies. But they would blind their reader with shew of answer, where none is. For the first point was of every Churches <hi>power to cast out obstinate synners</hi>: the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of their power <hi>to elect and ordeyn officers.</hi> Now what are these to justify any unlawful ministerie, eyther set up by a people without the power of Christ, or received by the tradition of Antichrist? It had been their part, seing they deny their former grounds, to have shewed us some better by the scripture: which how they have doon eyther there or here, let their writings being viewed manifest.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they say <hi>if wee would here imply a particular matter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of their Ministers, about imposition of hands, that is a point also left
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19514:35"/>
to further consideration,</hi> &amp;c. I answer, no, we mean others of them that were Ministers before, and such as have had (some of them,) imposition of hands twise: and this they could not but see plainly to be our intent in that 4. article: though they wink and wil not see it, and are mute, and will not defend it, but wind away to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things not there intended. Let them therfore in their next, bring a playn defence of their Ministerie, which by their new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is overthrowen: and use no more such tergiversation.</p>
                  <p>Vnto the other thing objected in the 3. &amp; 5. articles by Lawn printed: First they <hi>signify that their testimonie against the antichristian hierarchie treated of in the Confession, is not by them reversed or weakned any way &amp;c.</hi> I answer, these are but words: in deed and truth, the contrary wil appear. For as heretofore they <note n="a" place="margin">Apol. p. 108.109.110.111.112.</note> proved Antichrists baptisme to be not a true but a false sacrament; but now they plead for it <note n="b" place="margin">Advertis. p. 54.55.</note> to be the one true baptisme of Christ: so having heretofore witnessed against the whole Antichristian <note n="c" place="margin">Confess. art. 29.30. &amp; in many treatises.</note> hierarchie of prelates Preists &amp;c. their offices, entrance and administration: they now compare the popish ordination with the baptisme. Also they bring to warrant this, the Preists and Levites which were caled of God; as after is to be seen: and yet they would be thought, not to <hi>reverse their testimonie.</hi> Secondly they tel us how they were combred with the <hi>Anabaptists, and occasioned to think of their ministerie</hi>; as <hi>1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That imposition of hands is of God, and not an invention of Antichrists &amp;c.</hi> I answer, thus also they shalbe occasioned to think of the Popes <hi>excommunication,</hi> for that is Gods ordinance as wel as their <hi>sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of orders</hi>: and of the Romish <hi>Mass</hi> or <hi>supper,</hi> for that is Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance also; though by them abused to idolatrie.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves long since so refuted them, without this their new plea: that ther needed no fear of their strength at al. Finally, the impositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hands by an Antichristian prelate, upon that ministerie which is not of Christ but of Antichrists apostasie, I deny that such imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands is of God: and that such the whole ministerie of Rome is, is proved at large by many scriptures, in M.

                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly they say, <hi>they find not precept, example or ground in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, binding them to the repetition of [that ordination.]</hi> I answer, it is very true; no scripture bindeth men to repete or doo agayn such abominations.

They unjustly insinuate Anabaptistrie against us very often: but themselves are in like actual transgression with the Anabaptists (if their doctrine be true), and yet manifest not their repentance, nor tel us by vertue of which ordination, they doo now administer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

Otherweise if they must have a new office; how can they doo it by their old ordination? Even in Rome it self, when a Preist is promoted to a Bishops office, he is new <note n="a" place="margin">Pontific. de co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scer. elect. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisc.</note>

Psal. 119, 21, 128. Rev. 9, 3. &amp; 14.9, 10, 11.</hi> Thus he then wrote, but now we find an other maner of plea.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sixtly they say, <hi>That they find in scripture some officers admitted with it, some without it.</hi> This I find not. They allege <hi>Act. 13.1.2.3.</hi> where <hi>Paul and Barnabas had it.</hi> It is true: yea Paul had imposition of hands twise, <hi>Act. 9.17. &amp; 13.3.</hi> but where is the scripture that sayth <hi>some had it not</hi>? They say, <hi>we read not that the other Apostles had.</hi> what then? dooth this proov they had it not? So we may also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the other Apostles were never baptised, for we read not that they were. We read not (say the Anabaptists) that children were baptised in the Apostles dayes: wil these men now conclude, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not baptised. But doo not they know, that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thus drawn negatively from scripture, are generally blamed for insufficient?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seventhly they say, <hi>that some churches hold it not of necessity to be had &amp;c.</hi> I answer: that is nothing to such as hold it, and have Elders to doo it. But they diminish the state of the question; for when the Apostle speaketh of <hi>Jmposition of hands Heb. 6.2.</hi> dooth he mean the outward ceremonie onely, or the doctrine of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, caling, &amp; ordination signified by the sign? I hope the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churches deny no principle of religion, such as that is. So in this case spoken of, were it onely the outward signe, I would not contend. But they compare the baptism of Rome and the Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of Rome togither: no new baptising into the church, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no new ordeyning unto the ministerie: but as al come out of the Apostasie baptised Christians, so some doo come ordeyned mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.

                  <p>Finally let me admonish the reader, that <hi>The man of syn,</hi> who boasteth himself to be <note n="f" place="margin">Sext. decr l. 5. tit. 9. c. 5 in glossa.</note>

But this being tyrannie and usurpation in him both over church and common wealth, he hath alwayes had as good authority to make a Lord Maior in London, as to make a Bishop there, and to create a Prince as wel as a Preist or prelate: the one is injurious to the State, the other to the Church.

Rev. 14, 9, 10.</note> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, should have from God such a sign and seal; but they falsly usurp the same, as many other things to their just judgement. Yet need not men that discern and forsake those lyes and impostures, to have any new washing: because the Idolaters heretofore <note n="m" place="margin">2 Chro. 30, 1. &amp;c.

shewed at large in our former writings, <hi>Discoverie, p. 116.—120. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie p. 110.—113.</hi> For though the degree of syn in Rome be greater by farr then that of Apostate Israel, (as elswhere <note n="a" place="margin">Arrow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Idol. c. 5.</note> is also manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:) yet seing they then were fallen <note n="b" place="margin">2.

                  <p n="2">2. They proceed secondly and say, <hi>Jf the baptism had in the church of Rome be not true baptisme, then it is not the Lords baptisme: and then they which have no other but it, should get the Lords baptisme, afore they come to the Lords table, to eat the Lords supper &amp;c.</hi> I answer, this reason is the same in effect with the former, and there answered, as also long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe objected by the enemies of the truth, and refuted by <note n="a" place="margin">Discov. p. 116. &amp;c.</note> M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. We have gotten the Lords baptisme by coming to the Lord in true faith and repentance, who <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3.11 1. Cor. 12.13. 1. Pet. 3, 21.</note> baptiseth us with the wholy Ghost and with fyre. As for the outward washing which we had, it need not be repeted; as before is shewed: and we may as lawfully eat the Lords supper without a new washing, as the Idolatrous Israelites turning to the Lord, might eat the passover with out a new cutting or circumcising. <hi>2. Chron. 30.1.5.11.18.19.20.21.25. Ezra. 6.21.</hi> So wheras they charge us with <hi>profaning the Lords table,</hi> it is turned upon their own heads: for they have these many yeres professed the Romish baptisme to be not a true but a <note n="c" place="margin">Apol p. 110—113.</note> 
                     <hi>false Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whiles yet without a new washing they did partake of the Lords supper. If this be to <hi>pollute</hi> and <hi>prophane it,</hi> as now they press us, why doo they not first repent themselves of such <hi>prophanation</hi>; why cal they not in, their former writings, and refute them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Agayn</hi> (they dispute) <hi>ther is but one baptism, Eph. 4.5. Baptisme in the church of Rome, eyther is that one baptisme or is not it. Jf it be that one: then is it true baptism: if not, then they which have no other but it, have not that one baptisme, and therfore must get it &amp;c.</hi> I answer, 1. This agayn
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19514:40"/>
is the same argument with the former, and before answered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ground from <hi>Eph. 4.5.</hi> was that which <note n="d" place="margin">Epist. l. 1 epist. 12.</note> Cyprian builded on, who taught rebaptising of such as had been baptised by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks: whose arguments seing our Adversaries thus urge, we pray them tel us, whither they be of Cyprians mind for rebaptising; and if they be, wherein they differ in that point from Anabaptists? If they be not, then it seemeth they hold that al such as are baptised by hereticks, Antichrists, excommunicates, schismatiks, and other like, have that one true baptisme of God, <hi>Eph. 4.5.</hi> and so have the seal from God of forgivenes of synns, and are one body with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And if not, then they reason but for fashion sake, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us and the world with questions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Furthermore</hi> (they argue) <hi>such baptism is eyther a seal of Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or not. Jf it be, then sure it is true baptisme. Jf not, then 1. they which have no other baptisme, must with the Anabaptists get another, that they may be assured they have the seal of Gods covenant &amp;c. 2. then that ther neyther have been nor shal be in Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of Gods people &amp;c. Rev. 18.4. 3. then, baptism now had in Apostate churches is not answerable to the circumcision had in the Apostasie of Jsrael: for that was true circumcision &amp;c.</hi> I answer, they may by a litle varying of words make an 100. such reasons, alone and the same; al begging the question, and prooving nothing. What one scripture or reason fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, is here brought to prove Antichrists baptism, true baptisme? Let any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> define by the word, true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptism, &amp; then compare therwith the blasphemous Christening before set out from Bellarmine, and he shall see what accord is between them. And wheras the burden of these mens song, is, wee must ells baptise agayn: this is no proof at al; for (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that which is before answered,) what if it be our errour that we baptise not agayn? wher be then all their proofs, are they not vanished into smoke? Verily I should much rather incline to Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans error (though I am farr from it) for a new washing: then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the sacrilegious washing used by that man of syn with most high dishonour to the blood of Christ, to be that one true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an baptism; the seal of Gods covenant. For that of <hi>Rev. 18.4.</hi> because God caleth his people out of Babylon, therfore Babylons baptisme is true baptisme, is without all colour of reason. As if one should argue thus, God by Ieremie caled his people out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Ier. 51, 45. therfore Babylons sacrifices, and sacraments,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19514:41"/>
were true. Who would not rather conclude hereby the contrary: God caleth his people out of her, therfore she vvith all her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyt service, sacraments &amp; apish imitation of Gods holy things, are detestable and cursed. Agayn, a people may be Gods, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptised: as the uncircumcised Israelites vvere Gods people, <hi>Deut. 29.10,—13.</hi> vvith <hi>Josh. 5, 4, 5.</hi> The 3. point of Israels circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision to be true, is but barely by them affirmed, vvithout proof; and is before disproved. And if they shal continue thus to say al things, and prove nothing: I vvill never trouble my self more to ansvver their discourses.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Finally</hi> (they reason) <hi>if baptisme in Rome be not true baptism, then (as we also sayd) it is an idol; bearing shew and image of that which it is not in truth. And jdols ar things of naught &amp;c. and so baptisme in Rome, is a thing of naught; and to be estemed as nothing in the world, as filth, or doung &amp;c.</hi> I answer, idols are of two sorts; some merely devised by men, as Ieroboams <note n="†" place="margin">1.

Thus is there a mixture in Antichrists Christening, of both sorts of abominations. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we renounced that Romish baptisme, as an impure idol in their abuse, standing up in the place of Christ and his precious blood, which it is not; pretending to give grace, and wash away synns, which it dooth not; but it is a lye <note n="“" place="margin">Isa. 44, 20</note> in the right hand of al that so receiv it: and the saying of the Apostle is verified in it, <hi>an idol is nothing in the world. 1 Cor. 8.4.</hi> Yet, I hope, they think not that the Apostle is contrarie to the Prophet, who sayth <hi>their idols are silver and gold, the work of mens hands, Psal. 115.4.</hi> an idol then for the matter and workmanship is somthing, but for the relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, or divine grace, it is nothing: and thus th'Apostle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as his next words shew, <note n="*" place="margin">1.

                     <hi>ther is no other God but one.</hi> So Popish baptisme, as touching the material thing is somwhat, the salt, the water, the oil, are God creatures: the outward action is the work of the hands of an idolatrous Preist; and this work remayneth as did the work of the Idolaters circumcising in Israel: but as touching the relation, (which is the mayn thing in a sacrament,) that it should

Now why should one of these sacraments be true, and not an other? Al that are not Antichrists bondmen, detest his Mass as a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous idol: let them that lyst, honour his baptism. Agayn, <hi>exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Finally touching circumcision, I think it cannot be manifested that any peoples fallen from God and his Church, using it colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie for a religious action, (as al Antichristians and heretiks doo baptism at this day,) did or were bound to cutt their foreskin the second time, if they came unto the truth of God: as for example, the <hi>Colchians, Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> whom <note n="g" place="margin">Herodot. in Euterpe.</note> histories mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be circumcised; or the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> whom Mr Iohnson <note n="h" place="margin">In Answ. to Mr Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob. p. 68.</note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to have <hi>stil vsed circumcision.</hi> Hereunto we may add out of the Iewish records, how they hold, that <note n="l" place="margin">Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, tract. de circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. c. 2.</note>

                     <p>These things premissed, I come to our Opposites arguments. Their first reason from <hi>2. Thes. 2.4.</hi> is unperfectly alledged, for the

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God</hi>: wherupon their conclusion must be, that <hi>Antichrist sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as God in the church of God.</hi> And if they can prove that he is <hi>the true God,</hi> I wil yeild that his temple is the true temple, &amp; his Church <hi>the true church.</hi> Otherweise, if he be but an Idol and not God: his Temple church and body, wil prove but an Idol like himself, and his <hi>blasphemie</hi> is worse then theirs <note n="y" place="margin">Rev. 2, 9. &amp; 3, 9.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, they take it for granted, that by the <hi>Temple</hi> is meant the <hi>church</hi>: and so goe on in obscuritie. Wheras the Temple did primarily figure out Christ, <hi>Joh. 2.19.21.</hi> and in the heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, (the true church), ther was no other temple seen, but the <hi>Lord God almightie and the Lamb</hi> (Christ) which are <hi>the Temple of it, Rev. 21.22.</hi> If in this sense we understand that speech of Paul <note n="z" place="margin">2.

                        <hi>Great high Preist</hi>: the Pope is usually intituled <hi>Pontifex maximus</hi> the <hi>Greatest high-preist</hi>; and reason ther is for it, because <note n="f" place="margin">Steph. Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tracens. in orat. in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <hi>in the Pope ther is power above all powers, as well of heaven as of earth,</hi> as in a publick Council it was spoken of this Beast. Now that these things should be true of the <hi>man of syn,</hi> otherwise then by lyes spoken in hypocrisie, none of grace, I know, wil affirm.</p>
                     <p>Secondarily the <hi>Temple</hi> figured the Church, but first the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik or universal church Eph. 2, 21. then every particular church by proportion, 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. Which of these two, our opposites doo intend, they shew not. If they mean a particular church; it wil not agree with the prophesies of Antichrist, whose <hi>Citie</hi> or church is so great, as <note n="g" place="margin">Rev. 11, 8.9.</note>
                        <hi>peoples, kinreds, tongues</hi> &amp; <hi>nations,</hi> doo dwel in the streets therof. Neyther is that answerable to the Temple in Israel, which was not for one synagogue, but for <note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 16.16.</note> the whole natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iewes, and for the <note n="i" place="margin">1.

If they mean the catholik or vniversal church, (vvhich indeed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ claymeth for his Temple,) then we are to be taught of them,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19514:44"/>
how that whoorish company that <note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 13, 4</note> worship the Beast and Dragon; can possibly be the true catholik church and spowse of Christ, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therweise then by counterfeysance and lying ostentation, even as the Divil himself is an <note n="l" place="margin">2.

                     <p>And the very word <hi>Temple,</hi> leadeth vs to vnderstand Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs church to be but a counterfeyt. For what was the <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in Israel? Not the Church or congregation of Gods people properly, for they were the <note n="m" place="margin">1.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but it was a sacramental sign of Gods dwelling with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it is written, <note n="n" place="margin">Exo. 25, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>they shal make me a sanctuarie, that J may dwell among them.</hi> So Solomon built the Temple that God might <note n="o" place="margin">2 Chron. 6, 2.</note> dwel therin:: and for the times under the gospel, God promised, <note n="p" place="margin">Ezek. 37, 26, 27.</note>

                        <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that worship therein,</hi> which is the people.

But as Antichrist shal not professedly deny the true God or Christ, though in deed and truth <note n="r" place="margin">2 Thes. 2.4.</note> he falsly sheweth himself that he is God: so shal he not professedly deny the Temple or church of God, but falsly vaunt his adulterous synagogue to be the same. Gods true temple and tabernacle is in mount Sion, in <note n="s" place="margin">Rev. 14.1.17.</note> heaven, wher God sitteth <note n="t" place="margin">Rev. 16.17. &amp; 7.15.</note> on a throne and dwelleth among his people; wher is the <note n="u" place="margin">Rev. 11.19.

us, that Antichrist <hi>sitteth as God in the Temple of God,</hi> it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood first of their invading and destroying of Gods church and people, as the hethens of old <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 79.

                     <p>The next point that Antichrist is <hi>to be sought there, and not among the Jewes Turks &amp; Pagans</hi>; is a fallacie from an insufficient division; for al out of the true Church are not <hi>Jewes,</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> ther is a fourth to make up the mease, even <hi>popish Antichristians,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these is the <hi>Man of syn</hi> to be found, though with a visar on his face, and a sheepskin on his back.

Yet in very deed, so much as in them lay, and us stood with the safetie of their deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kingdom, the Divil of old, and Antichrist his son of late, have sought wholly to take away the church &amp; truth of God; and to put lyes in the place. But God hath nourished the woman (his church) in the wildernes, from the presence of the Serpent, <hi>Rev. 12.14.</hi> And for further answer hereof, let us hear what M.

                        <hi>J would know of yow</hi> (sayth he) <hi>who are so deep a clerk, how Antichrists church and religion should justly be accounted a mysterie of iniquitie, and truly be sayd to speak lyes in hypocrisie, also privily to bring in damnable heresies, and to have a shew of Godlynes, if they did so absolutely and wholly depart from the faith, and not onely from some points therof &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Fiftly they add, <hi>And so Jsrael is often caled the Lords people, in the time of their Apostasie: 2. King. 9.6. &amp; 13.23. 2.

from the Kingdome of David, and Preisthood of Levi, both which were sacramental types <note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 33.21 22.</note> of Christ and his Church; when they left the other testimonies of Gods presence, the Temple and Altar at Sion, where God had sayd he would <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 132.13.14.</note> dwel for ever; and builded them new <note n="c" place="margin">Hos. 8.14 11.</note> Temples and Altars to syn, forgetting their maker; when they set up Calves and <note n="d" place="margin">2 Chron. 11.15.</note> Divils to worship God by; then presently <note n="e" place="margin">1 King. 13.1. &amp;c.</note> God sent his Prophet to them with a denunciation of judgment, which being done, he was to avoid them as Hethens &amp; Publicans; <note n="f" place="margin">ver. 8.9.</note> not eating or drinking in the city: which because he did (though drawn in by the lye of another Prophet,) the Lord <note n="g" place="margin">ver. 26.</note> slew him with a Lion. And all that feared God, <note n="h" place="margin">2 Chron. 11.13.16.</note> both Preists &amp; people, left the country and went to Iudah: and the rest wer stil <note n="i" place="margin">Hos. 4.15.17.</note> caled upon by the Prophets to forsake them, as not being Gods <note n="k" place="margin">Hos. 2.2.</note> 
                        <hi>wife,</hi> that is, his Church: and their estate shewed to be <note n="l" place="margin">2 Chron. 15.3.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the true God, and without Preist, and without law: and they were unto God <note n="m" place="margin">Amos 9.7.</note> as the Aethiopians. Now wheras our Opposites allege, God did not presently cast them off; it is true, in respect of caling them to repentance, and of their dwelling in the land, or, as the scripture saith, <note n="n" place="margin">2 King. 14.27.</note> 
                        <hi>of putting out the name of Jsrael from under heaven</hi>: for his covenant was to punish them <note n="o" place="margin">Lev. 26.16.18.21.24.28.33</note> by degrees, &amp; at last if they repented not, to scatter them among the Hethens, til their <note n="p" place="margin">ver. 41.39.40.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised harts should be humbled, and they rewed their former syn; and then would he <note n="q" place="margin">ver. 42.45.</note> remember his first covenant, &amp; so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv them agayn to grace in Christ. And as for not casting them presently out of the land, the Lord dealt with them, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dealt with the Hethen Canaanits which were spared therin for a time, <hi>because their wickednes was not yet full,</hi> Gen. 15.16. If this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience towards them, wil not prove them a true Church; no more wil Gods like patience towards apostate Israel. And how they in their impenitent estate, <note n="r" place="margin">2 King. 17 13.14. &amp;c.</note> hardning their necks dayly more &amp; more, could be sayd to be the true Church of God, (though they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed <note n="s" place="margin">Hos. 11.12.</note> him with lyes,) and in the covenant of his grace unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; I leave for them to judge that are wise in hart. As for these mens double <hi>respects,</hi> they are not al of them syncere. They would have it said in respect of the Israelites, (and not of the Lord) that they were <hi>without God, without Preist, without law, none of his wife, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving children of whordoms, and the Lord is not with Jsrael</hi> &amp;c. &amp; agayn in respect of the Lord (and not of themselves) that he is caled <hi>their

God,</hi> and they <hi>his people,</hi> and their <hi>children borne to him,</hi> and Israel <hi>not to have been a widow forsaken</hi> &amp;c. I answer, whatsoever was syn, was wholly their own, and whatsoever was grace, was wholly Gods: &amp; this is true in the best Churches in the world. But whatsoever was a reproof and punishment for their syn, respected both Gods jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and their demerit: and whatsoever acceptation of grace was in them, respected both Gods mercy in Christ, and their <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3.30.</note> faith. If therfore they were in any sence a true Church at that time actually, it must needs be by mutual refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on both parts, God offring, they <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 5.17.</note> taking his grace offred; through his holy Spirit working in them: otherwise it is a mere fiction in religion, to make difference where none is. Now let them shew that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the grace of God, caling them to repentance: we shew the contrary by the Lords own testimonie, who for their unbeleef and stubborn disobedience <note n="c" place="margin">2 King. 17.13.14. —22.23.</note> did put them out of his sight in wrath. And if men accept not the grace of God: his caling upon them to repent, makes them no more his Church, then the Hethens <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 14.15. &amp; 17.30.</note> unto whom he doth the like.</p>
                     <p>Agayn, it is not sound to say that in respect of themselves onely, it was spoken by the Prophet <note n="e" place="margin">2 Chron. 25.7.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord is not with Israel, with any of the children of Aephraim.</hi> For he there dissuadeth Amaziah from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the army of Israel to help him: his reason is, <hi>the Lord is not with Jsrael</hi>: this most directly respecteth the Lord and his <note n="f" place="margin">Hos. 5.6.</note> withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his presence from that people. Even as Moses sayd, <note n="g" place="margin">Num. 14.42.</note> 
                        <hi>Got not up [to warr] for the Lord is not among you</hi>: did not the event shew (when they <note n="h" place="margin">vers. 44.45.</note> fled before their enemies) that is was meant in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Gods presence and help now withdrawn from them? Also when it is sayd in other scriptures <note n="i" place="margin">Iudg. 2.18.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord was with the Iudge</hi>: and <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 118.6.</note>

                        <hi>the Lord is with yow, while yow be with him, but if yee forsake him, he wil forsake yow,</hi> doth evince manifestly, that it is an evil glosse, when the text sayth <hi>the Lord is not with Israel,</hi> to turn it by <hi>respects,</hi> as if nothing were meant but <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael is not with the Lord.</hi> So in the other speech <note n="n" place="margin">2 Chron. 15.3.</note> 
                        <hi>Israel</hi> hath been <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the true God</hi>; the words folowing <note n="o" place="margin">vers. 4.</note>

that it was in respect of Gods forsaking them also, and not onely of their forsaking him.</p>
                     <p>No better (if it be not worse) is their citing of <hi>Hos. 2.2. she is not my wife,</hi> that this respected Israel in themselves: be it so, but what foloweth? <note n="†" place="margin">Hos. 2, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>neyther am J her husband</hi>: and if the former branch res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Israel, then this respecteth the Lord, especially seing he tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Ieremie, <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 3, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>J cast her away, and gave her a byll of divorcement</hi>: unless they wil say this also was not spoken in <hi>respect of the Lord.</hi> They doo not wel therfore to cite one branch of the text, and concele an other, deceiving the reader. How and in what sense God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them <hi>his people,</hi> I have shevved <note n="“" place="margin">p. 81, 82.</note> before: their former state, their present pretense to be the Lords, and the future mercie that they should and yet shal receiv, might wel and did occasion such spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but in deed and truth it was as God sayd to them <note n="†" place="margin">Hos. 1, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>you are not my people, therfore wil not J be yours.</hi> And as for God remembring his covenant, it is true even to this day, for they are <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 11.28.</note> beloved for their fathers sakes, and shal agayn have the benefit of their first <note n="“" place="margin">verse 26, 27. Levit. 26, 45.</note> cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and so may stil becaled <hi>Gods people,</hi> as the Prophets foretelling their return, doo <note n="‘†" place="margin">Deut. 32, 43. Isa. 49.13.</note> intitle them: yet I hope our opposites wil not hereupon conclude, that the Iewes now (whiles they continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant) are Gods true visible church. That of <hi>Jsrael and Judah being no widow, Jer. 51.5.</hi> is a prophesie of their return out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and restoring of their common wealth, as the whole argument there manifesteth. They should repent and seek the Lord <note n="‘*" place="margin">Ier. 50.4, 5.</note> with tears, and renew the covenant on their part, and God <note n="‘؛" place="margin">verse 20.</note> vvould forgive them al their synns. This therfore is not spoken in respect of God onely, but of them also turning by repentance to the Lord in their affliction, and the Lord turning to them; as the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this prophesie shevveth, <hi>Nehem. 9.1.2.—32.—38.</hi> Moreover, it proveth not that Israel vvas alvvayes before, Gods vvife or Church; for it is playn to the contrary, <hi>Hos. 2.2.</hi> and she vvas divorced, <hi>Ier. 3, 8.</hi> &amp; dead in syn, <hi>Hos. 13.1.</hi> but now vvas to be fulfilled in such as returned, that vvhich vvas prophesied, on Israels part, <note n="†" place="margin">Hos. 2, 7.</note>

                        <hi>J wil marry the unto me in faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their applying of these things to our times, is not in all points aright. For though in this, Antichrists synagogue and Israels doo agree, that neyther be Gods true Church: yet the perfect type of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19514:51"/>
Rome, as God describeth it, is <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 17, 18</note> Babylon: and vve should not be vviser then God. And if they cannot prove Babylon then to be Gods church, which was not more deep in syn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now Antichrist is, and which citie had <note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 87, 4</note> promise and <note n="*" place="margin">1.

Rev. 14 9, 10. &amp; 18 8.21. &amp; 19, 20, 21. 2. Th 2.8.12.</note> prophesies and threatnings of assured destruction.</p>
                     <p>They proceed further to <hi>a double regard of apostate Churches, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with other peoples; as Jsrael compared with the Philistims &amp;c, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and counted Gods people, having the onely true God for their God: 2 King. 5, 8.15.17. &amp; 9, 6. but being compared with Judah, is an harlot and not Gods wife. Hos. 2.2.5. &amp; 4.15. &amp;c. So the church of Rome in apostasie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Iewes, Turks &amp; Pagans, ought to be counted Christians, and the Temple of God, the Church of God brought to the faith of Christ, 2 Thes. 2.4. with Ezek. 43, 7, 8. Zach. 6, 12, 13. Eph. 2, 11. — 13, 19, 21. 2. Cor. 6, 16. Rev. 11.19. but agayn co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mpared with the ancient church of Rome, &amp; such as now are faithful churches, she is to be esteemed the great whore, beleeving &amp; speaking lyes in hypocrisie &amp;c, Rev. 17.1.5. 1. Tim. 4, 1, 2, 3. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 10, 12. And thus in a double consideration, it may be sayd of Rome in one respect, ther is a true Church there, and in an other respect ther is a false church there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer; first to the <hi>double regard</hi> of Israel; if they mean that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of Iudah, and not also of God, Israel was caled none of <hi>Gods wife</hi>; it is untrue, and before by me disproved. If they mean, that not onely in respect of God, but of Iudah also, Israel was an harlot, and not Gods wife, it is true, and maketh so much the more against their estate, but nothing at al, (no not in shew) for it. And how Iudah respected Israel, (besides al former testimonies of the Prophets alleged,) their continual warrs both with word and sword do manifest, as when after <note n="a’" place="margin">2. Chron. 13, 4, 5.—12</note> reproof of their faling from God, they kylled <note n="b" place="margin">verse 17.18.</note> five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel at one battel: besides their continual combates after, excepting some few Kings which made amitie with them, for which they were reproved: as the Prophet sayd to K. Iehoshaphat for joyning with the King of Israel against the Aramites, <note n="c" place="margin">2 Chron. 19, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>wouldest thou help the wicked, and love the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hate the Lord? therfore for this thing, wrath from the Lord is upon thee.</hi> But had the Israelites been their brethren in the faith, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Christ, Iudah had <note n="d" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3, 10, 11, 12.</note> synned greatly in so destroying them.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19514:51"/>
And how the Iewes afterward also esteemed of their faith and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, their Rabbines testimonies in the Talmud sheweth, where they say of the ten tribes, <note n="a" place="margin">Talmud Babyl. in Sanhedrin, c. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Aein lahem chelek leolam haba</hi>: that is, <hi>they have no part in the world to come,</hi> in life eternal; and that <hi>the Lord did put them from upon their land in this world, and wil send them into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther land in the world to come.</hi> Did they now (may we think) esteem them within the holy covenant, and to have true circumcision, <note n="b" place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 4, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the seal of the righteousness which is by faith?</hi> As for comparison with the <hi>Philistims</hi> and other hethens, it is true they were caled the <hi>people of the Lord</hi>; because they never renounced their God in name and professedly: but pretended the contrary. Yet seeing they did but compass the Lord with <note n="†" place="margin">Hos. 11.12</note> lyes and deceyt: this their vayn profession did nought avayl them, with God or his Saincts. And so at this day, the Iewes professing the God of Israel, and praying to him, &amp; reading his lavv and prophets dayly in their synagogues, may be caled Gods people in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of pagans vvhich knovv not God or his scriptures at al: but vvorship the Sun and Moon, and some of them the Divil, by open profession. Yet none I think vvil say, that the Ievves novv being vv<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out Christ, are actually in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. Agayn, the Turks that profess <note n="a" place="margin">Alcoran, azoar. 2, 3. &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>One immutable, living, true, most wise &amp; high God</hi>; and doo acknovvledge Christ <note n="b" place="margin">Azoar. 67</note> 
                        <hi>to be sent of God with his gospel,</hi> and call him <note n="c" place="margin">Azo. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>Ruchella,</hi> that is <hi>the Breath</hi> (or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) of God</hi>: these men in comparison of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostata, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vvretches, and Atheists, may be caled the people of God, and Christians: though in deed, they be farr from being eyther.</p>
                     <p>Secondly for their <hi>double regard</hi> of the Church of Rome, I say as before of Israel, that in comparison vvith Turks and paynims, they may be caled Christians, but are in deed false Christians, such as in name and shevv pretend to be Christs; but are Antichrists &amp; vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 13, 3, 4.</note> the Dragon, and the Beast, and him that <note n="f" place="margin">2 Thes. 2, 4.</note> fitteth as God in the Temple of God; so to them the scripture may be applied, <note n="g" place="margin">Rev. 2, 9. &amp; 3, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>they say they are <note n="h" place="margin">Iewes</note> Christians and are not, but doo lye, and are the synagogue of Satan</hi>: and if this vvill help them, let them make the most of it. It is sufficient for the matter in hand, if in respect of Christ and his covenant, and in comparison vvith Christs true Churches, that sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue be condemned, as the <note n="i" place="margin">Rev. 17.1.</note> 
                        <hi>great whore,</hi> the <hi>beast</hi> that <note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 17.8 &amp; 19, 20.</note> came up from, and shal again goe down into the bottomless pit. vertheless (but that comparisons are odious) it might easily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19514:52"/>
that though Antichrists Church pretend to be Christs, &amp; so in name is better than Turks and Pagans: yet in deed, those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants are in some things to be justified, in comparison of them. For Iewes and Turks, are not so gross as to worship <note n="g" place="margin">Offic. B. Mariae. ref.</note>

                     <p>Wheras they end their divers respects, with <hi>a true church there, and a false Church there</hi>: they conclude not the question, but closely turn it away.

We acknowledge therfore with them, that things are often in the scriptures spoken in <hi>divers respects,</hi> without observing wherof, men shal err infinitely: but it is evil for men to make other respects then God maketh; the scriptures may easily be misapplied; as a litle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they bring us the respect of <hi>Abraham unrighteous in himselfe, but righteous by faith,</hi> Rom. 4.3.5. I hope they wil not apply this to that <hi>son of perdition,</hi> in 2 Thes. 2. for that were a most wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet thus they have shuffled togither many scriptures (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the simple may be deceived,) for to shew things diversly spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which none doubteth off: but how soundly they have proved An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists Church to be Christs, let the judicious Reader give sete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

Who wil feare his estate, or amend his life, for the doctrine of such men, as pul down with the left hand, &amp; build up with the right?

                        <hi>strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wickednes, by promising him life</hi>?

                        <hi>The papacie is in the church as the order of apostasie in the howse of God 2 Thes. 2. the man of syn sitteth in the temple of God, with his whole order or rank of Apostates: and the Temple of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in that order and number of Apostates, which is a thing most strange and furthest off.</hi> And again, <hi>the papacie is a poyson in the Church, which must needs be vomitted out if it wilbe preserved, or ells the Church wil be extinguished by it, if it suffer that poyson to prevayl and possess all the veyns of the body.</hi> I answer, true it is, and I agree with them, that the <hi>rank of Apostates,</hi> is farr from being <hi>Gods temple</hi>: wherupon I assume, the whole popish church, preists and people are a rank of Apostats; because they worship <note n="s" place="margin">Rev. 13, 4. &amp; 14, 9, 10.</note> the Beast, who sheweth himself there for God, where the Pope is acknowledged to be <note n="t" place="margin">Concil.

                        <hi>gangrene</hi> perform any action of a natural body or member?

Thirdly, seing the popish eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical hierarchie, (which <note n="a" place="margin">Concil.

For his ministerie is not among them; as for his word, the people have it not so much as to read; and the service of their Gods, is in a tongue that they understand not: what now is the meanes of their caling?

He is wel contented that Christ be an holy Prophet, and a most worthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea the word of God, the sowl of God, and the spirit of God, conceived of the Holy Ghost, but he wil in no case grant him to be the Son of God, nor that he dyed here for mans redemtion.

Thus though they outwardly appear very vertuous, yet are they the malignant Ministers of Satan, denying the Lord which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them.

                  <head>The 6. point of difference: in the letter.</head>
                  <p>WE had learned <note n="a" place="margin">Confess. art. 38.</note> that al particular congregations are by al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> means convenient to have the counsel and help one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, in al needful affaires of the Church, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the common faith: yet here when differences had arisen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our common faith, and could not amongst our selves be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, they would not desire nor consent to have desired, the help of our sister Church at Leyden, although it were instantly urged by many members that their assistance should be had.</p>
                  <p>With this they joyn the 9. out of the printed copy, to the effect of the former.</p>
                  <p>Against this they except, <hi>1. that though for some reasons they abstey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from desiring it, or sending for them, or giving their consent so to doo: yet they were content to permitt it: which was not a denying of the practise of it, as the printed copy objecteth &amp;c 1 Cor. 7.6. Deut. 24.1.</hi> I answer; the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on which we grounded that article, being Act. 15. chap. 1. Cor. 14.33.36. shew an other manner of dutie, then a <hi>permission.</hi> For when dissention had arisen in the church of Antioch, <hi>they</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 15.2.</note> 
                     <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned</hi> that some should goe up to Ierusalem, unto the Apostles &amp; Elders about the question. And the messengers were <note n="c" place="margin">vers. 3.</note> sent forth of the Church, and <note n="d" place="margin">vers. 4.</note> were received by the Church at Ierusalem, &amp; the Apostles and Elders, who <note n="e" place="margin">ver. 25.</note> came togither with one accord, &amp; after discussing and agreement, wrote to the Church of Antioch, what had <note n="f" place="margin">vers. 28. &amp;c.</note> seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to them. And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19514:59"/>
Paul sheweth a reason of such mutual entercourse, when he sayth, <hi>Came the word of God out from you eyther came it unto yow onely</hi>? 1 Cor. 14.36. Wherfore seing the word of God, was come unto the Church of Leyden, as unto us; and considering the practise that was in the APOSTOLIKE Churches hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and our profession to walk according; it is but a sory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to say they would <hi>permitt of</hi> it, if others did it; as Moses <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 24.1.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the bill of divorse, for <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 19.8.</note> the hardnes of mens harts; and as Paul spake a thing <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.6.</note> 
                     <hi>by permission, not by commandement.</hi> For we think those Apostolical practises, Act. 15. to be in sted of commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto us, Philip. 3.17. And our Confession noteth it as a dutie, even <hi>by al means convenient.</hi> By this al may see, how weak a defense they make, for their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Their reasons folow; 1. <hi>that the other Church &amp; we were in peace togither: &amp; if by this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the peace should be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they should not say, they se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> I answer, this exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil lye against al Churches in the world that are at peace: and might have been objected by the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious at Antiochia; Act. 15. and wil be colour to cut off al use of that practise, and of our former profession. 2. <hi>That the Church of Leyden was in the same error with us who desired their help.</hi> I answer; this also might the troublers of the Church in Antioch, have objected as colourably against the Church of Ierusalem, Act. 15. &amp; it is a barr to cut of al help from other Churches. Yea if any heresie be raysed by the officers in a Church, contrary to their former faith: they may thus except against al Churches, unless they wil fal into the same errors with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly they allege <hi>former experience with others.</hi> I answer, we never had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the like: M. Smyth in deed leaving the truth, and broaching his heresie against the translated scripture, would needs publish it in our Church. It is one thing to raise up a new er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as did he: an other thing to mainteyn the ancient faith, as did the Church of Leyden with us. So that which they fourthly allege, is but a pretence that al wil make, be their errors never so new; &amp; they that urged circumcision Act. 15. could plead the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in Israel, farr better then these our opposites can doo for the power of their Eldership.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Their next exception about <hi>a letter written by some to that church, a copy wherof was desired, but not granted &amp;c.</hi> is an occasion taken by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19514:59"/>
that accident. But they know, that before that letter was written, they signified their unwillingnes to intreat their help: and now were glad, that they had gotten a show to hold them off. 2. For the Letter mentioned, I did think it was meet they should have sent it, and so I wish they had: though they shewed reasons of their not doing it for the present, but have since that time sent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a copy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They next object, <hi>my own subscribing of those letters to Leyden &amp;c &amp; ask whether I denyed the practise of that article &amp;c.</hi> I answer; first I had sundry times signified in publick my mind, that their help should be desired in the end, if we could not agree, but we would first use al means among our selves: &amp; so I never was of their mind, who refused absolutely to desire their help; &amp; this they wel know. Secondly, I subscribed those Letters, because I thought it meet that a copy of the foresayd letter should have been sent, as before I sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Thirdly for the last letter (which to my remembrance I consented to,) they know I refused to subscribe it, til some words which implied an absolute denyal of requesting their help, were put out and changed. Fourthly, when no means among our selves could end the strife, they know, how I both intreated them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent they might be sent for: &amp; when they would not, my self went and obteyned their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. In deed I was loth to trouble them without urgent cause; &amp; with my brethren now opposite, I sought to nourish peace, &amp; it may be more then I should; which now they thus return upon me: and I therfore shal bear, and make use of it for hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Of their reasoning with them when they came from Leyden, it is not to the point in hand. Yet how unwilling they were even to <hi>admit</hi> of it, all present then did see: and the Elders of the church of Leyden, as occasion is can testifie. But I forbear to insist upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: which are not so profitable for the readers.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Finally they ask <hi>why we did not desire the counsel and help of the Dutch &amp; French churches</hi>? I answer, first these our opposites with us, had before dealt with them against their errors in this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points, so farr as we could, and ended with them. What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had we now to call for them to defend that errour which our whole church had condemned? Secondly, they could not discuss the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversie in our English tongue, to the understanding of our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19514:60"/>
Congregation novv troubled: no nor of al our Elders. Thirdly, these that thus object, did not (to my remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) desire any such thing: if they had, I should not for my part have refused so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as did they. But thus have they turned every stone, to see if they could find any colour, for vvithstanding the help of the Church of Leyden: vvith vvhat vveight and equitie, let the prudent judge.</p>

               <p>I answer; first our former profession touching <hi>Christ the onely King and Lord,</hi> we hold it firm in all points as before; and never had so much as a thought to reason against it. Secondly for the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial government of the Church by the Officers, we never disputed against it: but doo stil acknowledge the whole Church and every member is to submit unto their ministration in the Lord.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wheras we had learned, and professed that Christ was the onely King, and Lord of his Church, and had left unto it among men, but a ministerial government, and that al the multitude of the members, the saincts ought to obey, and submitt to the Eldership in every Church: Now we have lately been taught, that the people as Kings have power one over another: and that the saincts being Kings are superiour to their officers, because the order of Kings is the highest order in the Church &amp;c. Also that the Church may in relation to the officers being servants therein, be caled a Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And for this he quoteth my book, <hi>p.</hi> 217 225. adding that I <hi>advance the people one above another as Kings, intitle them with kingly and lordly power in the outward policie and affayrs of the church, by which as the Prelates on the one hand, so the people on the other hand become idols.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Acknowledging the former and latter part of that he sayth we have formerly professed, I except against the midle clause of the sentence, in sundry respects. First, in that he drawes the question, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the power of Christ in the Church (common to all) to <hi>the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and guydance of the Church <hi>in the use of this power,</hi> which is peculiar to the officers: which may also more clearly appear to him that reades the places he quotes in the margent, wherein he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth (though more covertly) a double vntruth: the one, that, because the government of the Officers is onely ministerial and not Kingly, therefore there is no Kingly power left vnto the Church, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with the Saynts for the suppressing of sin: the other that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Officers are the onely governours of the Church, and so by vs acknowledged, therefore they onely have the power of Christ. And thus he would closely wrap up the Churches power, in the officers government, and not be seen in it. For the clearing then of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between government, and power; it must be considered, that by government may eyther be vnderstood the whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it as a part thereof. Or it is taken more strictly for the guidance, and ordering of the Church in her Publique affayres, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, and exequution of them: and so it apperteyneth to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and is clean another thing then the power in question. For the proving of this difference. The Apostle Paul wrytes to the whole Church of Corinth to excommunicate the incestuous man, <note n="*" place="margin">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Church in deposing her officers, dooth not separate her self from them, (to speak properly) but them from her. Wel, to take the least libertie he wil give the people. If they <hi>may separate from al their officers persisting in transgression,</hi> then they must receive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnt of sin, which is orderly brought, and by sufficient witnesses, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and must examine, and judge the matter. Now if it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue power to receive a complaynt of sin against one brother, and to examine, and judge it, and so to censure him by exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, if ther be cause; dooth it not also argue power to receav a complaynt of sin agaynst all the officers, to examine, and judg it, and so to censure them, as their is cause, by deposition? But what now shall the Elders do accounting themselves innocent, and wrougfully accused, whilst the Church thus examineth things, and judgeth of them?

Iohnson so practise? or are they not now to do a speciall work of theyr government, not onely in preserving order, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, instructing, and guiding the Church by the wod of God in her whole procedings. By which it appeareth, that judging of sin, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to suppresse it, is one thing, and government for the right use, and ordering of the same, another thing. The officers which are jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged do govern, and the bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

governed by them. We may yet further see this difference even in the Lordly governments of this world, and that both in Peace and Warre.</p>
                     <p>In the civile government of our own land, (then the which none in the world in the right vse of it is more excellent,) when a malefactor comes to be arraigned at the Assises, or Sessions, he is to be tryed by his country, (a competent company, where all cannot possibly passe vpon him) which they cal the Iury, whose power and sentence is of such force, as that the Lord Cheif justice himself, and all the Bench with him cannot proceed agaynst it, eyther for the quitting or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the person: and yet the Bench governeth the whole action, and the Iury is by them, according to law, to be governed. I wish the Elders with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we have to do, would allow the body of the church the like liberty, at their Sitting, as they call it, that is, at their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Sessions: or rather that they would better consider, that they are as Ministers to <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>stand, and serve,</hi> and not as Lords to sit, and judge.</p>
                     <p>Lastly when an army is sent against the Kings and their own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the government is in the Captains, and Officers, but so is not al the power for fighting with, and subduing of their, and their kings enemies. Neyther is all the power of the church, which is an <hi>army with banners,</hi> in the officers alone, for the the subduing of Christs, and their enemies, sin, and Sathan, though the government be. Thus may the difference plainly be seen betwixt power, and government: in the opening of which I have been the longer,<note place="margin">

                        </note> because 1. I think it a mayn ground of our controversie. 2. Our opposites do much insult over us, as speaking contradictions, when we yeeld the officers all the goverment, and yet deny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the power.) 3. The weaker sort ar much misled, and caried away thorough want of discerning this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                     <p>I proceed to a second thing, and affirm, that <hi>Christ hath not left to the church amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men onely a ministerial</hi> power (which he confusedly calleth <hi>government</hi>) as he sayth. He hath left <hi>the word of God, and gospell</hi> in the church, which is lively, <hi>and mighty in operation,</hi>

But it is one thing to say the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is onely ministerial, and another thing, that men can onely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster it. For men may be the ministers onely of that power, which is kingly, and Lordly in it self, and so over men, as this is. So the saints can only minister their kingly power by participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christs a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>noynting, as one speciall grace they have received: of which more hereafter.</p>

my words, misinterprets my meaning, and conceals that which I have writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and he read, in my book, for the explaning of the same.</p>
                     <p>And first he sayth I have taught that <hi>the people are as Kings one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another;</hi> that I <hi>advance them one over another, as Kings, and above their governours intitling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Kingly, &amp; Lordly power,</hi> (that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, as he explaines himself) <hi>in the outward policie of the Church.</hi>

                     <p>I doo not in these places, or any other, advance the people one over another, much lesse over their officers, in the outward policy of the Church, that is (as he explains his meaning) in the government of it. I doo every where profess the Officers the governours, and the people the governed by them.</p>
                     <p>Neyther do I any where affirm, that the people ar <hi>Kings, or as kings one over another,</hi> as he chargeth me. I say in one place, that <hi>the saynts are not Kings for themselves alone,</hi>

                     <p>And this meaning being held, it may safely be taught that <hi>they are over one another,</hi> that is, to watch one over another, and so as kings to conquer their spirituall enemies one in another mutually.

                     <p>I ad in my book, pag. 225. that, the officers being by their order, servants, the Church may in that relation be called a Lord: not for the governing of them, in the outward policie, and affaires in the church, as he injuriously collects: but as they are <hi>for the Churches</hi> use, and

service; which he conceals: though I expresly so note in the same place; as also that the same <hi>Church-servants are Church-governours: the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernment of the Church being a mere service.</hi> And for the thing If the officers be to be called servants to the Church, what is the Church to be called to the officers? A servant is a relative, and must have a correlative: and I would know by what name he would call it, if not by the name of Lord, Mayster, Mistress, or the like. And if he deny this, he takes away from men the use of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reason, and understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Let the servants know, yea though stewards, as are the Church-officers, add so betrusted with the goverment in a special ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <note place="margin">Confess. art. 24.</note>We professed heretofore, that Christ gave the power of receiving in &amp; cutting off, to the whole body togither of every Christian congregation, &amp; not to any one or more members sequestred from the whole &amp;c. Now we have been taught that in cases of question and controversie, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the people are the Church; though al the Elders and other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be against them, &amp;c. and so have the power to receiv in &amp; cut off &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I answer, ther is no contradiction in these things; we hold stil in all points according to the article alleged: neyther ever taught we the people onely to be the Church sequestred from their officers; but the officers governing, and the people governed, to be the Church which hath the power, to use in holy order. But if these officers fal into heresie or wickednes themselves, or to abett wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes in others, and wil not be reclaymed by any holy means the Church can use, then may they by the Church which chose them, be deposed, as unworthy of their places, yea and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so al other impenitent sinners. and this by the voices of the most of the congregation, if al consent not; aswel as members or officers are received in by the voices of the most, if some doo dissent: for ther is one power for them both. And these our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites must eyther manifest, that if one or 2 officers or members doe dissent in a controversie, ther is a <hi>sequestration of them from the whole,</hi> and the Church then <hi>hath not the power of Christ to receav in and cutt off:</hi> or els al may see, that this is a colourable accusation of theirs, &amp; no contradiction of ours. For if the consent of al &amp; every one, be not necessaryly to be had, they dissenting through their ignorance, frowardnes, or the like: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most voices must prevayl. But how farr their new doctrine (that the Elders are the Church,) is, both from our former professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and from equitie, I have before shewed.</p>

                  <p>I answer; we differ not from our former profession, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv the reader, by turning <hi>government</hi> into <hi>power,</hi> which we in our publik profession heretofore distinguished, and so doo still: giving the government of the whole Church, and all the actions of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the officers: the power to the whole body; and so to the officers with the people, as joyntly Kings and Preists: of which things we have spoken before.

                  <p>Wee professed hertofore, that no sacraments should be ministred,<note place="margin">Confess. art. 34, &amp;c.</note> until the Pastors or Teachers were chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ordeyned into their office: now it is held by some, that seing al the holy things of God are the churches, &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without officers are a church, therfore they may without officers have the use of the sacraments and al the holy things of God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may receive in by baptisme, confirm by the Lords supper, cast out by excommunication &amp;c. And in this writing sent unto yow, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, how they inferr that people without officers may cast out, and therfore may receiv in, ther being one power for both.</p>
                  <p>I answer; they wrong us, and abuse their readers. 1. There is not to my knowledge (as before I <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 66.</note> testified) any one man amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g us, that held or holdeth that people without officers may have the use of the sacraments; but we all continue in the same profession that we made before. 2. It is frawd, and abuse of the reader, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to me, when they first speak of <hi>receiving in by baptisme,</hi> and then allege from my letter, that <hi>the people without officers may receiv in</hi>: as if they would bear the world in hand, I therfore hold, they may baptise. Wheras first the scripture sheweth that persons uncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised (and consequently unbaptised), may pass into the Church-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Lord, <hi>Deut. 29.10.11.12.13.</hi> compared with <hi>Jos. 5.2.5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly the children of the faithful, are born members of the Church, and are in the covenant before they are baptised. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man excommunicated, may be received into the Church, yet not by baptising of him. And 4. we heretofore in our Confession when we <note n="†" place="margin">Confess. art. 34.</note> denyed the sacraments in a Church without officers, yet <note n="*" place="margin">Conf. art. 24.

And these men in their second exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here write, there is one power for receiving in and casting out, and that people without officers may doo both, as is observed before.</p>
                  <p>I answer; their frawd and wrongful dealing is also observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and here to make their syn the more remarkable, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claym it the second time. Of ministring the sacraments, and of receiving in and casting out of members, and against usurping or executing a ministerie without due caling, we hold as alwayes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: they repete the same things, but to their own further blame; for our professed enemies, doo not ordinarily more wrest our words.</p>

We learned and used heretofore to apply to our estate and use, the things that the scriptures teach concerning the governours and people in Israel. Now we ar excepted and opposed against, if we doo so, with these exceptions and the like, that they had civil authority and government, which the church hath not; that they could not in Israel forgive one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers syn, as we can now: that the people now have more power then in Israel, because now we folow Christ into heaven, wheras the people might not folow the high Preist into the most holy place &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I answer; the right applying of our estate to Israel, we alwayes have and stil doo approve: but these mens wrested proportions, and making the Church in <hi>Mat. 18.</hi> to be the same with the Iewes Synedrion or Sessions of civil Magistrates, we doo reprove, and so have doon in our more ancient writings, <hi>Refut. of M.

the Preist,</hi> (the minister of the Church,) that so <hi>the Preist making an attonement for him before the Lord, it should be forgiven him, Levit. 6.2.5.6.7.</hi> Now under the Gospel, the Law is, <hi>if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him, and if he repent forgive him: Luk. 17.3.</hi> neyther is such a man bound to goe to a minister that he may pray for, or forgive him; as the Papists by proportion <note n="*" place="margin">Bellar. de Poenit. l. 2. c. 3.</note> doe gather. 3. That th'Apostle also sheweth a difference of our Church estate from the Iewes politie, <hi>Heb. 9.7.8.9. &amp;c. &amp; 10.19.20.</hi> compared with <hi>Gal. 4.1.2.3. &amp;c,</hi> is manifest: neyther can our opposites deny it; onely they cast stombling blocks in the readers way: saying thus, <hi>1. what if any other would say, that Elders and Kings now should have more power then they had in Jsrael, because they now folow Christ into Heaven &amp;c.</hi> To omit their yll framing of the reason, for their most advantage, I answer, they that would so say, should shew their ignorance, or a worse humour, Because Christs Kingdom is not <note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 18, 36</note> of this world, neyther medled he with Magistrates power, but left it <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13.1 &amp;c.</note> as it was, authorized of God his Father, and not subordinate to his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship; as <note n="“" place="margin">pag. 55.</note> before is shewed: and therfore Magistracie hath ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor less by him now, then in Israel and former ages.

The Second block is a marginal note, that <hi>yet the people were typically caried in by the high Preist, in the precious stones on his shoulders and brest, as the most holy place it self was a type of Heaven.</hi> I answer, this is true, and confirmeth that which I sayd: for if into the earthly sanctuary the people could not freely enter, in their own persons, at any time, but figuratively, although they had so much as by faith in Christ did save them: then is our estate now, as touching the outward Church order and politie, better then theirs, which are not restreyned from any place whither the ministers of the Gospel may them selves enter, but we are <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 20, 6.</note>

And shall the Church, because of the abuses, tyrannies, heresies which their Elders have in all ages brought in: refuse to have any moe Elders? no more may the Elders refuse to have the people to hear and judge causes of publick syn with them, because of the disorder and unrulynes of some; whom the people have been as willing to reprove and censure as the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themselves. As for the Church <hi>subject continually to contentions and scandals &amp;c.</hi> it is most true by the Elders means: for (to let pass what we have seen among our selves,) let all histories be looked, &amp; it wil appear the Church hath never more abounded with conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and scandals, then when al power was in the Ministers hands, and the people excluded. Yea even in the Elders most solemn as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and Councils; as Gr. Nazianzen in his time complayned, being himself an Elder or Bishop. <note n="*" place="margin">Nazianz. epist. 42. ad Procop.</note> 
                  <hi>I am minded</hi> (sayth he) <hi>to shun all assemblies of Bishops, because I never saw a good event in any Council, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19514:67"/>
did not rather increase then diminish our evils. Their contention &amp; ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, passeth my speech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they speak of their offer <hi>to bear with us in our difference of judgement, if we would be content to walk peaceably with the Church in that our difference: but this was refused.</hi> I answer; they might also (if they had pleased) have shewed the reasons of our refusal, which more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once we gave them: as, 1. Because we are willed <hi>to observ all things whatsoever</hi> Christ <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded</hi> his disciples, Math. 28.20. and therfore his ordinances must not be left in practise, and holden in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because touching the ministerie it is sayd, <hi>a man can receiv no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except it be given him from heaven, Ioh. 3, 27.</hi> now to the Ministers it is given to <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20.28 Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 12.7.8. 1. Pet. 5.</note> feed guide and govern the Church, but not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be the Church, and to chalenge the power of the same in things perteyning to the kingdome of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because touching the people it is sayd <hi>Stand fast in the libertie wherwith Christ hath made us free, and be not intangled agayn with the yoke of bondage, Gal. 5.1.</hi> but this was a part of the peoples Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, recovered out of Antichristian bondage, viz. to judge syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are within, <hi>1. Cor. 5.</hi> and to decide publik causes with their ministers, <hi>Act. 15.23.—28.</hi> as parts of the same Church and body, <hi>1. Cor. 12.27.28.</hi> therfore to be held fast, not onely in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but in practise.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because such giving place to the usurpation of the ministers, was the mean of Antichrists beginning and climing to his preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; which had the people resisted at first, and practised the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the order set by Christ, he could not so have prevayled. And now also we should look, that Antichrist being expelled, doo not agayn set in his foot.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because if we holding otherweise in judgment, should let the true practise of the Gospel goe; posteritie after us, being brought into bondage, might justly blame and curse us, that would not stand for the right of the people, in that which we acknowledged to be their due. These things considered, we desired them then, and stil doo, to shew us how we could let goe our ancient practise, until our judgment were by the word of God changed.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>The 2. thing by us offred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We desired, that then we might have a peaceable parting; and to be two distinct congregations, ech practising as they were perswaded, yet nourishing brotherly love and unitie. This also they would not agree to, unless we would leav this citie.</p>
               <p>Their answer is;</p>
               <p>A peaceable parting we grant they desired in word, but in deed stayed not with us, but departed whiles we were considering whither it could lawfully be effected or not. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Our replie.</p>
               <p>We desired it in word and deed instantly: alleging the parting of Paul and Barnabas, <hi>Act. 15.39.</hi> the doctrine of the Apostle, <hi>Phil. 3.15.16.</hi> the practise of Abram and Lot (though in a civil case) parting to avoyd strife, <hi>Gen. 13.8.9.</hi> the avoyding of publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch in the world &amp;c. But whatsoever we could say, perswaded them not, but they withstood us. We stayed long, and had we folowed their delayes, we might have taried to this day, and have had no other answer at their hands. How long have they been considering about their Teachers ordination, and stil it dependeth.</p>
               <p>We are not ignorant of their pretenses, to put off the thing they like not, with a consideration. But in deed we had their refusals often, before we parted. Which was much in them that had cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their former profession, and innovated the practise, that they should so refuse. Had we been the men that had made such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, and they continued as before: we had surely been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated long ere that time of our departing. Of our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synes with the Church of Leyden, it fel out after; and is now to be spoken of, in the third place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We procured, though without their consent, the help of the English church at Leyden, who laboured our peace: a way of peace by these the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves propounded, and by the Church of Leyden and vs agreed to, these after reversed, and stood not unto, unless we would goe dwel out of this citie. And al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hough in the treatie of the agreement, it was testified by the Elders of that Church, that unless it were to the apparant undoing of us and of our families, wee should not be dismissed agayn to dwell here: yet because wee would not absolutely promise to leave this citie, they would not stand to the agreement which themseves had made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:19514:68"/>Their answers, &amp; our replies.</p>
               <p>Here they seek to wind out themselves from blame, by sundry pretexts, and long narrations. I will breifly touch the principal, being sory to weary the reader with our strifes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First for the thing by them propounded, (of mens going <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one Church and Pastor to the other</hi>) &amp; by us agreed unto; it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we desired or liked such a course: but earnestly desiring peace upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any tollerable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, &amp; seing for the present no unlawfull thing in it, we assented; though the thing would have been much to our detriment. For all of us must have made a journey to Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and back agayn, with charge and trouble, it being then mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winter: and such as could have had means of livelihood there, must there have remayned; which perhaps would have been the one half of us, and so our congregation had been greatly diminished, which was one mayn thing that our adverse brethren plotted, as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents did manifest. The Church at Leyden also, as we, must have suffred continually their &amp; our members, to goe when they would, into the practise of those errors with our opposite brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: a thing which we wil carefully take heed of, how ever we yeild to the like agayn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the officers of the Church of Leyden did at the first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we all must remayn with them: we cannot say. Sure wee are, we did not so conceiv; but M. Iohnson so propounded it, as we al even by his words understood it otherweise, and himself being after pressed, could not deny it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the thing was agreed of, and the second time by them absolutely concluded, &amp; that <hi>three were sent with the message after the brethren of Leyden</hi> to signifie it, as they write: is true, and past deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That after they <hi>made new motion of an other course,</hi> is true also; but they omitt the publik breaking of the former agreement: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they signifying that forasmuch as they perceived our purpose was to return and live agayn in this citie, they did playnly <hi>reverse</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The motion which they made <hi>of a double practise,</hi> as it was disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the Church of Leyden (as they signify:) so we also shewed like reason of our dislike, it being both unlawful for vs to practise syn as it were with the right hand, and righteousnes with the left; &amp; no likelihood of our peace, but of greif and dayly dissentions.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:19514:69"/>6. Touching the motion made by the Church of Leyden, for <hi>coming first to the Elders as Church governours &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>for admonition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caried according to the alteration practised and agreed upon</hi>; wherupon these our opposites now <hi>observ</hi> against us, for not yeilding therto, <hi>how greatly we oppugned the ordinance of God touching the Elders hearing and judging of causes &amp;c.</hi> this rightly weighed, wil shew how greatly we are by them abused. For first, it was such a course as neyther the Church at Leyden would bind themselves to walk in, neyther did these our opposites, or we, think it to be according to the order of God. Secondly they tel us not, (wherfore we desire them in their next to tel us,) whither themselves would sincerely have prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised these things according to the true intendement of the Church of Leyden that motioned them. Thirdly, for the <hi>cariage of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> spoken of; it was found out, and by M. Iohnson himself pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly acknowledged that the controversie between us, was therin closely implied and yeilded unto them, when upon <hi>dispising the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Elders, the parties were to be excommunicated.</hi> This being thus manifested, with what conscience could we yeild to practise errour privily brought in under hand: and deny to practise the same thing publickly professed? Would not al men, and even they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have blamed us for such dissimulation? Fourthly for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Elders first as governours, vve did then and doo novv yeild it the brethrens duty, in doubts so to come for counsel &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise: but for to bind all men in most manifest synns vvhich the Church should judge, to come first to the Elders onely, and so to lay it on the brethren as for not doing it, they should be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; and yet both sides acknovvledge it is not the order of God: vve told them this vvould be to deal worse then the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, vvhen none of vs vvalked in that vvhich vve professed to be the right vvay, but leaving that, vvould stablish our ovvn traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cast out men for not observing them. These vveighty reasons they overpass, and bear the vvorld in hand <hi>how greatly we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned Gods ordinance touching the Elders</hi>: vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vve but oppugned the Elders traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, least they should be advanced above the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God.</p>
               <p>Next folovv their reasons vvhy they vvould not stand to their former agreement vvith us, <hi>nor have spiritual fellowship</hi> (as they write) <hi>with us in such estate &amp; walking. 1. Because they could not find warrant
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19514:69"/>
for it in the word of God.</hi> I answer, if they acknowledge no warrant found for our peaceable parting here, nor dismissing to an other Church: what remayned, but eyther we must yeild to their errors, which for the reasons foreshewed we might not; or ells part from them as we did; the causes of the division being in them, both by broaching errour, and refusing peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their second reason is, <hi>because we refused</hi> (as they say,) <hi>disobeyed and spake evil of the truth and way of God.</hi> I answer; first this is to take that for granted, which is the question betvveen us. Secondly if this reason be good, and the truth be vvith us, (as vve doubt not of it:) then they grant us that vve had just cause to leave spiritual fellovvship vvith them, vvhich departed from, and spake evil of, and persecuted the truth and vvay of God, vvherin themselves once wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with us. Howbeit, if we would have lived at Leyden, all had been peace: is it more lawful, trow we, to <hi>speak evil of, and disobey the truth</hi> there, then at Amsterdam?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their third reason is, <hi>because we refused to continue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with them, though we might be suffred to walk in peace with protestation in our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of judgment.</hi> I answer, this having been first offred by us to them, and they refusing it, as before they grant; it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth upon their own heads, if any weight be in it. Secondly, we have shewed sundry reasons from scripture, why we might not so walk: &amp; have never yet heard from them, any like reasons to warant us, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against a synful practise, and yet to practise it dayly. If our own harts and mouthes condemn us, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.20.</note> God is greater.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their 4. reason is, <hi>because some of us professed we would not deal in causes by way of protestation, neither when we were with them nor from them.</hi> I answer; first the different mind of some few, is not of weight to break the agreement with us al. Secondly, this might have fallen out also occasionally, if we had lived at Leyden; where they would have had peace with us. So it is our living in this city, that was in deed the onely true cause vvhy they stood not to their agreement, the other are but pretenses.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their 5. reason is, <hi>because we went not from one Church &amp; Pastor to another, so to live and remayn, but purposed when we had joyned unto them, presently to return and live here in this town apart from them.</hi> I answer; this was in deed that which troubled them; they could not indure us in the same city by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet they cannot deny but it was promised, we
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19514:70"/>
all should live and remayn there, <hi>unless it were to the apparant undoing of us and our families.</hi> And were not these loving brethren, that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we and our families should be undoon, then they would want of their wills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what reason (much less necessity) can they shew why we must goe from one church and pastor to an other, and may not continue in the place and state wherin God had called us, with as many officers already among our selves, as the Church of Leyden had; and one a Teacher of the word. They tel us afterward, <note n="*" place="margin">Advert. p. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>that the very naming of going to another Church &amp; Pastor, caryeth weight of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with it</hi>: belike because he is <hi>a Pastor</hi> that sayth it: for word of God shew they none, that binds men to goe to another Church where ther is a Pastor and no Teacher; but forbids them to remain in their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion and church, where ther is a Teacher and no Pastor. Especially when without the apparant undoing of men &amp; their families, they can not remove their habitation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their 6. reason is, <hi>because by such walking of ours, great reproch would come upon us all, with much dishonur to God</hi> &amp;c. I answer, it <note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 17.1</note> can not be avoyded but offenses wil come, but woe unto them by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come. Yet greater reproch (as we alwayes feared) is come by their refusing peace with us, (unless it were upon unlawful &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable conditions,) then vvould have been by our peaceable parting, vvhich vve often and instantly desired.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their last reason is, <hi>because they thought there should alwayes be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in such cases used, as wherby the Lord might work upon our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to consider our estate, and to repent and yeild to the truth and way of God which we had refused &amp; oppugned.</hi> I ansvver, first this manifesteth their minds to be farr from peace vvith vs, vvhatsoever they pretended; unless vve vvould yeild to their innovation and prelacie. Secondly this reason, if it be good, serveth asvvel for them that should live at Leyden, as at Amsterdam: unless they vvould permit us there to oppugn the truth and vvay of God, as they intitle their errours.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this evil being fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, that they doo not onely <hi>refuse &amp; oppugn the truth</hi> offred; but forsake, speak evill of, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the truthe and vvay of God vvhich they had long imbraced &amp; vvalked in: the judgement vvhich they give upon us, is most just upon their ovvn heads; by the sentence <note n="“" place="margin">Mat. 7, 2, 12.</note> of our Saviour. And vve could doo no less vvith these our merciless brethren, that vvould nourish no peace vvith us, unless eyther vve made shipvvrack of a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19514:70"/>
good conscience, or would consent to the undoing of our estates and families; but leave them as we did, by the Apostles warrant, for <hi>causing division and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which we had learned Rom. 16.17.</hi> If their new doctrines be good, I shal acknowledge we have greatly synned: but if they be the high way to Antichristian promotion, and a bereaving of the Church of her right &amp; power, as we are verily perswaded, and doo trust we have so proved it; then have they given sentence against themselves, and except they repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, their condemnation shalbe just.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding al their former reasons, they after allege, <hi>that they reversed not their agreement concerning such as would goe and live with the Church at Leyden, but onely about such as purposed to return and live here &amp;c.</hi> I answer, by this al may judge whither the fear of God, or fleshly policie did more prevayl in them. For such of us as would have lived at Leyden, they pretend they <hi>could find warrant for it in Gods word,</hi> but shew none: they would let them there, <hi>refuse</hi> &amp; <hi>speak evil</hi> of their pretended <hi>way of God,</hi> without leaving any thing to work vpon their consciences, &amp;c. and yet have peace with them as Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian brethren. Onely at Amsterdam these things might not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred. The Pope himself permitteth Iewes which never received his religion, to live in the same citie with him, where he is Prince: but these our adverse brethren, would not indure that wee, (though we never received their innovations,) should live in one city with them, where they were but strangers. What should we have found, if they had been Princes of the State? Secondly, they plainly <hi>rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> the agreement, as before was shewed, &amp; when some of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren desired their testimonial, for to goe to Leyden, they refused to give it. And we could not tel before we came thither &amp; tried, whether there would be meanes found for our living there or no. But strange and unheard of cruelty was in these men, that would bind us there to remain, though we and our families should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doon; &amp; being but strangers themselves in this city with us, would take upon them so imperiously to banish us the town, which the Lords of the city never offred. I wish they may find more mercie with the Lord at the day of Christ, then they have shewed unto us.</p>
               <p>And wheras they object, <hi>that when we left them, we went not to Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to ioyn our selves to that Church according to the agrement &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, there never was such agreement, that of our selves we should
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19514:71"/>
goe, but that by them we should be dismissed, and this they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doo, yea and publikly reversed the covenant that themselves had devised and twise confirmed: besides, that we of our own mind did never desire, but onely for peace sake consented to that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as before I shewed. Neyther was it ever agreed, that such onely as would remayn there, should goe: but it was general for us al. But these their cariages shew, what dominion such Elders would exercise over Gods heritage; and how unpossible it was for us to have peace with them, that would thus turn and wind, say and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, agree of a thing to day, and break it to morow. Our sowles were wearied, with their turnings of devises.</p>
               <p>Finally for our not <hi>remayning with them, til there was an answer of their Letter from Leyden,</hi> I answer, we taryed with them a good while after their foresayd letter, wheras we might upon their breaking of their own solemn agreement, added to al their former evils, justly have forsaken them. Neyther could the Church of Leyden (as it seemeth) tel what to advise us, and therfore gave no answer to their Letters, or to ours: and because they would have no hand in the breach between us, thought better to be silent; seing unto what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie things were brought. And the agreement between the Churches being disanulled, articles of warr and discord being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed to us, and written of to them; delayes onely sought to work our dissipation: we know no vvord of God, that bindeth us to suffer our selves to come into such bondage, vvith men that day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their publick doctrines and prayers, inveighed aginst the truth they formerly professed, vvounded the consciences of the brethren, and sought al occasions to dravv men from the right vvay and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Gospel. What should vve doo, but shake off the dust of our f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We therfore being desired therunto by Mr. Ainsworth, and occasioned by that which both Mr Iohnson and he have writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and taking the evils which have befallen others, as matter both of humbling, and warning to our selves, doo signify, what we know, and have found in our dealings thereabout.</p>
               <p>And first, Our special <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alling to intermedle in this vncomfortable busynes, was a letter sent vnto vs by some 30. of the brethren there. In which, mentioning in the beginning of it, their <hi>long, and greevous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversy,</hi> they signified how they had <hi>oft desired of the Church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest our help</hi> therin, and that <hi>the Elders would no way aporove therof:</hi> but would onely permitt our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, eyther of our selves, or at their request. Wherin they also certifyed vs, how some of them <hi>had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the exposition of these words Tell the Church, Mat.</hi> 18, 17. <hi>Tell the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> with some other particulars therupon depending, to be <hi>errour:</hi> and <hi>so were to prove their charge:</hi> and therfore <hi>earnestly requested us to help in that great busynes,</hi> that the truth <hi>might be mainteyned, and not by their weaknes injuried, and the innocent condemned: and that we would help the Lord against the mighty &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reason why they thus earnestly requested our help was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause M. Ainsworth was so sparing in opposing of Mr Iohnsons new doctrine (though alwayes misliking it) as they scarse knew how he was minded in the things: so loath was he to come to any profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and publique opposition with him, whom he rather hoped to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify by moderation, then by opposition to stop in his intended course. Besides he was careful not to give any incouragement to the too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oppositions of some brethren, though minded as they were, in the things themselves.</p>
               <p>This their letter, and earnest request in it notwithstanding, we we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not, but wrote to the Church and shewed them what the substance of the letter was; desiring by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be informed how things stood with them: and signifying withall, our vnwillingnes to interpose, but upon a dew, and necessary calling; and that also as much as might be, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conditions of best hope of good yssue.</p>
               <p>They, as before, denyed to approve of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permit it, and that vnder the terms of jealousy, and advantage, as appears by that which themselves have published: and did oft, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19514:72"/>
earnestly require of us a coppy of the letter before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, with the names of the persons subscribed unto it. Which though we judged, and still do, an hard, and extream impositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in it self, considering they themselves had permitted them to send unto vs, and knew from vs whereabout they wrote, and had not layd it vpon them to shew them their letter before they sent it; yet had we given way to their desires herein, had it not been for one phrase in the end of the letter, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borrowed from <hi>Deborahs</hi> speach against Sisera, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5, 23. and applyed as it was, might give offence, and minister occasion of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strife, which phrase also we reproved in the wryters of the letter, and they acknowledged amiss; professing notwithstanding they had no evill meaning in it, but onely a desire to provoke vs the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to supply their inability against those with whom they had to deal. Now for our withholding the coppy of the letter (though since that tyme, for their importunity we sent it them) as also for our purpose of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming unto them, and the ends therof, we will here insert what we wrote unto them in two severall letters thereabout,
<floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>For the former thus. <hi>If the letter wherof you desire a coppy, might further your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peace, or procure good to any, wee should easily answer your desire: but if, on the contrary, there were the least evill in it, wee should hold it our duties to deal with the parties offending, our selves, and not to discover their sin.</hi> And loath would we be eyther to minister matter of further scanning amongst you, or that any <hi>regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of unkindnes should come unto you from <hi>our hands.</hi> And the fear of this was in truth the onely cause, why we refused to send this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they required. Wherin if we fayled, (as we see no cause so to think) yet was it the errour of our love, and great desire of their peace.</p>
                        <p>About our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming we thus wrote. <hi>Our purpose therfore is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the request of the brethren which have moved us, and our duty; to send, or come unto you; not to oppose any person, or to mainteyn any charge of errour, but by all other brotherly meanes to help forward your holy peace (if so the Lords will be:) which how precious it is unto us, we hope to manifest to the consciences of all men: then which we know nothing in this world we haue more cause to endeavour, both with God, and your selves. Of which our comming we pray you to accept, and to appoint us some such time, as seemes to you most convenient. Whereal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we shall satisfy you to the utmost, both touching the letter, and other particulars in all equity, yea so farr as we can without apparant sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These things notwithstanding, they would not approve, but onely permit of our comming, as men use to permit of that which is evill, and which in deed they could not hinder. And so we came vnto them: first of our selves, and afterwards at the request of M. Ainsworth, and them with him, being sent by the Church, wherof we are: and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> our selves vpon them for the delivering of the Churches mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, did reprove what we judged evill in them, and that we confesse
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19514:72"/>
with some vehemency. And in that regard it was, that (vpon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by Mr. Iohnson for the free dismission of such mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with them, unto vs, as could not there walk with peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,, there lying no other cause against them; which should also be mutually performed on our part) we signifyed (as he wryteth) that <hi>wee little thought they had been so inclinable to peace; &amp; that if we had so thought, we would have caryed our selves otherweise towards them, then we did.</hi> And good cause had we so to speak. For neyther is the same cariage to be vsed towards men, prosecuting their purposes and perswasions, with all violence and extremity; and towards them, which manifest Christian moderation in the same: neyther had we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or have we since found the like peaceable inclination in them, to that which they then manifested. Which how great greif it hath been vnto us, and how it hath even wounded our very harts, he onely kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, which seeth the sorrowes of the hearts of his servants, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their teares in his bottel.</p>
                        <p>But to passe by these things, and to proceed. The motion made by Mr Iohnson for a peaceable dismission, was by the Church there received with generall assent; unto which the Church also at Leyden condiscended: and so sent back the Officers for the further rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it, and for some other purposes tending to the establishing of peace amongst them. Wherupon it was also the second tyme by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confirmed: alwayes in deed with submissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the word of God, as was meet: and that if eyther they, or we minded otherwise, we should so signify. Which notwithstanding they did not: but reversed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grement of themselves, without acquainting vs with the change of their mind or reasons therof.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards indeed, they gave us knowledge of their purpose, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in their former letter by themselves published, desiring <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our consideration about it,</hi> as if the thing which was fully agreed upon, as is aforesayd, and that oftener then once had been onely in consideration: and in their second letter (as also appeareth) they gave us certayn Reasons of their dislike.</p>
                        <p>Vnto which reasons of theirs we gave no answer (as they both write) before their parting. And the causes were. 1. For that they continued not long togither after they came to our hands. 2. We had upon occasion of the motion made for a double practise, propounded another course (both more fit, and warrantable, as we thought, then that) for the bringing of things first to the Elders, as appears in our letter. Vnto which course though we do not bind our brethren, yet may we safely say (so farr as we remember) that there never came complaynt of sin to the Church, since we were officers, but we took knowledge of it before: eyther by mutual consent on both sides, or at least by the party accused: with whose christian modesty, and wisdom we think it wel sorteth, that being condemned by two, or three brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19514:73"/>
he should not trouble the Church, or hazzard a publique rebuke upon himself; without counselling with them who ar set over him, and who eyther are, or should be best able to advise him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and which was the cheif cause, we were without all hope of doing good, when they once misliked the motion, which made it. Whilest they liked it, we had hope, though it were with hard measure to the other, and so did further it, to the utmost of our power: but when they layd it down, we knew all our labour would be lost in endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their second listing of it.</p>
                        <p>Lastly where Mr Iohnson affirmeth, that at the first treating of the matter, we conceived that those by them dismissed should remayn at Leyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with us, notwithstanding their want of meanes of living, it may wel be as he sayth, though we well remember it not. And therin all men may see, how we were even overcaryed with a vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of peace with them, and amongst themselves, and how farr wee were from being partiall towards them with whom we agreed in the things in controversie. Yea the truth is, we were boldest with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both because we would prevent all jealousy in the other, and preserve in them all the interest we could for the common peace: and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we were wel assured of Mr Ainsworths great moderation, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom the rest did much depend.</p>
                        <p>But howsoever we conceived at the first, it is certayn that both they, and we conceived otherwise in the agreement. And therfore when one amongst them made exception,<note place="margin">I. O.</note> that we should not dismisse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back, which came unto us, to live a distinct congregation in the same city with them, it was presently answered both by Mr Iohnson, and Mr Studley, that <hi>that concerned not them, but that they would leave it unto us:</hi> though that appeared afterwards to be the onely thing for which they broke off their purpose, and promise. And here the work of Gods providence is to be observed, that they who would have no peace with their brethren abyding in the same city with them, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to leave it themselves, and to settle their abode els where. Which thing, that it might well come to passe in short time, they were by us put in mind of before hand, if God gave them not agayne to reunite, which by a peaceable parting, might hav been furthered. Which how much better had it been they had admitted of, (all things considered) then, thorough extreme streytnes in themselves (not to medle with the mayn cause) thus to have made their brethren their adversaries, and themselves, yea and us all, a by-word to the whole world?</p>

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:19514:73"/>This is the record of our brethren of Leyden, touching our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Wheras our opposites object unto us, <hi>that we refused to trie if by writing among our selves, we could have come to better accord &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, first we had by a twelv moneths dispute tried if we could have come to accord; but were further off in the end, then at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Secondly things were brought to that pass, that the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of their errours was established; the truth in publik doctrines inveighed against; the opposers of their errours, compared to Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah Dathan and Abiram; the Lords supper of a long time not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred among us; occasions sought against sundry persons to cast them out of the Church; peace by us offred, by them refused; peace by them selves propounded and confirmed, and by them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn broken; open warr proclaymed against us, as against men that <hi>refused disobeyed and spake evil of the way and truth of God &amp;c.</hi> was this an estate for us to continew in togither, and goe to writing, which would prove we knew not how many moneths or yeres work? For loe to a letter of mine of 3. pages, they have given an answer of 70. and if they continue thus to multiplie, what volumes shal we have in the end: and when shal vve have an end? It is rather to be feared that vve suffred things to depend too long: for vvhen the Apostles found Christians liberty to be indangered, and bondage to be brought upon them, though privily, they <hi>gave not place by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection for an howr, that the truth of the Gospel might continew with them, Gal. 2.4.5.</hi> Thirdly it vvas a vvay vvhich they alvvayes mislyked: and in our former troubles, vvhen heretofore M. Smyth and others, having debated their causes in conference, proffered vvritings: then M. Iohnson himself, vvith the rest, vvithstood and refused that course. But novv, that vvhich they blamed in others, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in themselves: so partial are they in al things. When they like of a thing, it must be good: vvhen they mislike, it must be evil. We vvish they vvould shevv more sinceritie. And novv, as vve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Christian reader, not to be offended at the truth, because of our infirmities who cannot walk in it as we ought; nor to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the troubles and dissentions which Satan rayseth among Gods people: so wee desire these our opposite brethren, to return into the right way, from which they are estrayed, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away al love of preeminence, and of their own aberrations, to receiv agayn the love of the truth, and of brotherly concord: that

the name of God, be no more evil spoken of by the wicked, and that the harts which ar wounded by these dissentions, may be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refreshed. The Lord look upon the afflictions of Sion, wipe away her tears, forgive her iniquities, take away her reproch; restore her joy, and comfort her, according to the dayes that she hath seen evil.
