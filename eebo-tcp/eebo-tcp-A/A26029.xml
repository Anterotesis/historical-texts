            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. Aſhton left in a Friend's Hands: Together with

               <p>THus much is contained in the Paper that I deſign to leave with the
Sheriff.</p>
               <p>But being ſuddenly to give up my Accounts to the Searcher of all Hearts,
I think it a duty incumbent upon me to impart ſome things farther, which
neither the Intereſt nor Iniquity of theſe Times will, I conclude, willingly
bear the publication of, and therefore not fit to be inſerted in the Sheriffs
Paper.</p>
               <p>Some time after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arrival here, when it was expected,
that, purſuant to his own Declaration, and the King's Letter to the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
an exact Search and Enquiry would have been made into the Birth of
the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> there was a Scheme drawn up of that whole Matter, and
of the Proofs that were then (and are ſtill) ready to be produced, to prove
his Royal Highneſs's Legitimacy; but no publick Examination being ever
had, and the Violence of the Times, as well as Intereſt of the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not permitting any private Perſon to move in it, thoſe Papers have
ever ſince lain by: But it being now thought adviſable by ſome, to have
them printed and publiſhed, and (as at firſt they were deſigned) addreſſed,
at their next Meeting, to the Lords and Commons, entreating them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into that weighty Affair, and to call forth, examine, and protect (for
who elſe dares to appear) the many Witneſſes to the ſeveral Particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
offered to be legally proved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was ordered to carry thoſe Papers to the King my Maſter, for his view,
that his Leave and Aprpobation might go along with the Deſires of his good
Subjects here; and they being taken with me, with ſome other Papers of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a ſmall Trunck, amongſt my Linen, and other private things
of my own, and not in the Packet, (my Ld. <hi>Preſton</hi> being altogether a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the whole proceeding,) by this means fell into the hands of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Governours; who, tho<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Evidence at my Tryal, yet have I juſt Reaſon to believe my greateſt Crimes
were contained in them; and I do therefore conclude and hope, that I onely
am deſigned to be ſacrificed, who onely knew of them: Nor am I ſurpriſed
at it, ſince nothing, I think, can be more prejudicial to ſome Perſons preſent
Intereſt, than the expoſing of thoſe Papers to the Publick, which will ſet that
pretended Myſtery of Darkneſs in ſo clear a Light, that all Mankind muſt be
convinced of his Highneſs's being born of the Queen, and of their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
who have malitiouſly and deſignedly aſſerted that innocent Prince to
be an Impoſtor. The Love and Compaſſion that I have for my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as well as Charity, obliges me humbly to implore Almighty God to be
mercifull to it, and not to charge this great Sin to the publick Account, and

at their next Meeting, to examine into that whole Matter, and (if before that
time this be publiſhed) to enquire after, call for, and, if poſſible, retrieve
thoſe Papers that were taken with me; whereby the Obſtinate will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be convinced, the Ignorant informed, the Doubtfull confirmed, the
Eyes of all opened, and a ſacred moſt important Truth made apparent to
the whole World.</p>
               <p>What I have next to impart is not leſs material, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[But I do not think it a proper time to publiſh what follows next; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

               </p>
               <p>But I muſt not end this Paper till I have done one Act more of Juſtice,
as well as Charity, in behalf of my Fellow-Sufferer, Mr. <hi>Elliot,</hi> who was, as
I do moſt ſincerely believe, altogether ignorant, not onely of the contents of
the Papers, but even of the Papers themſelves, and no way concerned but as
a Paſſenger; and yet if Providence had not prevented our being all tried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as was intended, that innocent Gentleman had moſt certainly ſhared
in our Fates; for the Proofs, even at my Tryal, lay ſtronger againſt him than
my ſelf; for Captain <hi>Billop</hi> did then upon Oath, (unneceſſarily, I think,)
declare him to be much more concerned and importunate than I was, to have
the Pacquet thrown over Board; and yet ſingly from my being concerned,
and ſpeaking to him on that Subject, a preſumptive Evidence (ſufficient, as
it proved, with that Jury to find me guilty upon,) was drawn, that I knew
what was contained therein. But I do moſt heartily forgive them, and pray
to God, that this poor Gentleman, by gaining of Time, may eſcape better,
and that his innocent Blood may not be ſhed: And I hope theſe words of a
dying Man (though no legal Proof) may have ſome weight with an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
conſcientious Jury, (if ſuch a Jury he can get,) whenever he is brought
to his Trial.</p>

the following Paragraphs, that concern the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and—
I beg you to preſerve as Jewels, and publiſh them, either part, or all, (chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
