            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas in the Chart of the Lotterie lately erected, amongſt other things deuiſed for the aduantage of the aduenturers, there was a limitation of three moneths, within the compaſſe whereof, who ſo aduentured money into the ſaid Lotterie, ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of diuerſe profits and aduantages more then others that ſhould aduenture their money after the ſaid three moneths ended.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as in ſundrie parts of the Realme, the principall perſons that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bee the Treaſurers for the money that ſhould bee gathered in the ſeuerall ſhires of the Realme, had not receiued their inſtructions and charge in ſuch due time as was requiſite, by reaſon that vpon the firſt nommation of them, there were after ſundrie alterations of ſome by reaſon of ſickneſſe, of others by reaſon they were dead about the time of their nomination, and of ſome others, that after ward were ſo otherwiſe occupied in publique offices, as the ſaid ſeruice could not be by them executed, ſo as of the ſaid ſpace of three moneths, there paſſed ouer a good part, to the detriment of the aduenturers. Her Maieſtie being duely aduertiſed of the premiſſes, to the end that in the affaire of the ſaid Lotterie, aduanced by her Maieſtie for the good of the common weale, all her louing ſubiects ſhould be intreated with an indifferencie of dealing, and participate alike of the aduantages expreſſed in the ſaid Chart, without any preiudice of time paſſed away from them without their fault or occaſion: is pleaſed, that the aduantage of the ſaid three moneths now expired, ſhall be enlarged and proroged to all maner of perſons, that haue or ſhall aduenture their money into the ſaid Lotterie, for three monethes longer, to haue courſe and coutinuance for the ſpace of foure ſcore and ten dayes accompting xxx. dayes to the moneth, to begin within euery ſhire their accompt excluſiuely, from the xxiiii. of December laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>So as whoſoeuer within the ſaid three moneths of prorogation, ſhall aduenture, or at any time before haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured their money into the ſaid Lotterie, ſhall haue and enioye all maner, and as ample aduantages and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, as by vertue and tenour of the ſaid Chart, they ſhould haue enioyed if they had aduentured their money into the ſaid Lotterie within the ſpace of the three moneths mentioned in the ſaid Chart.</p>
            <p>And where as through the fault of Printing of the Chart, there hath bene miniſtred occaſion of certaine doubts and faults found in the ſaid Chart, among the which one is in the third Article of the conditions ſet foorth in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d Chart, in the firſt lyne of the ſame Article, in theſe words (to the number of thirtie Lots and vpward) it was and is ment, and is now explaned, for the benefite of the aduenturers, that thoſe words ſhalbe amended and redde thus to the number of xxx. Lots or vpward.) And where alſo through liſte fault, in the fourth and next Article of the ſaid Conditions, in the beginning of the ſaid Article be conteined theſe words (whoſoeuer ſhall gaine the beſt, ſecond and third great prices) The meaning and intent thereof for the like benefite of the aduenturers was and is to haue the vnderſtanding and reading of the ſaid words thus (whoſoeuer ſhall gaine the beſt, ſecond or thirde great prices So as in both thoſe Articles this worde (and) is to be changed into this word (or.)</p>
            <p>And where as alſo ſome haue mooued a ſcruple and doubt, that foraſmuch as no mention is made in the ſaide Chart incaſe of death of any of the aduenturers, before the time of the reading of the ſaid Lotterie, that the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the prices and other aduantages rehearſed in the ſaid Chart, that ſhould happen to the aduenturers at the time of the reading of the ſaid Lotterie, ſhall remaine to the heires, executors or aſſignes of the ſaid aduenturers. For the explaning thereof, it is to be vnderſtand, and the meaning thereof was alwayes: That euery aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may make ſuch aſſignation by Teſtament, deed or otherwiſe, of the commodity that may fall vnto him by the good fortune of the ſaid Lotterie, as he may or might otherwiſe do and diſpoſe of any other goods.

            <p>Finally, if any other ſcruple, ſuſpition, doubt, fault, or miſtyking may happen to be found (as euery thing for the ſatiſfaction of euery perſon, cannot be ſo exactly ſet forth in writing, but ſome doubts may chance to enter into the conceipts of men, and ſpecially of thoſe that be inclined to ſuſpitions.) her Maieſtie for a full and generall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction of all ſuch and all other aduenturers in this Lotterie giueth to vnderſtand, that the ſame reſorting to the Creaſurers of the Shires, Cities or good Townes, ſhall receiue at their hands ſuch reſolution and anſwere, to all and ſinguler their ſaid doubts, ſcruples and demands, as ſhalbe to their reaſonable contentation and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
