            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>Her speech is vaine, not put in Execution:</l>

But <hi>such,</hi> whose inbred loue to goodnesse, hath
implanted in them such affection to good men,
and such zealous hate to the vicious: that if
they were removed from the All-seeing <hi>eye</hi> of
<hi>Heauen,</hi> and the suspicious search of <hi>earth;</hi> yet
they would expresse their loue to <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> in
the lowest vault of <hi>darknesse.</hi> For <hi>these</hi> I am, and
may I ever be their Corriuals: for aspiring to
be great in the Court of <hi>vertue,</hi> is a glorious
ambition. Now for <hi>such,</hi> whose conceits groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Factors, or hireling Brokers, who set at
sale the stale commoditie of their Labours: for
<hi>these</hi> must taste of vulgar froth, or they are not
vendible<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> yet they will professe (how odious
soere be their profession) that they haue drunk
deepe of the iuyce of <hi>Helicon,</hi> and by vnvtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
raptures can extract the life and Elixir of
<hi>Poesie.</hi> Such as <hi>these</hi> (for these were they who

Art) caused <hi>one</hi> of the Fathers in great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to terme <hi>Poetrie</hi> the <hi>Diuells-wine;</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
whatsoever the loue of gaine, or their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempred

might those punishments be moralized, which
were inflicted on <hi>Stesichorus</hi> inveying against
<hi>Helen,</hi> on <hi>Aristophanes</hi> against <hi>Cleon, Eupolus</hi>

whose meriting Labours haue gain'd them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
esteeme. And <hi>these, (Aristippus</hi>-like)
haue ever grounded their Subiect on <hi>vertue;</hi>
preferring the minds lustre, before the Bodies
cover. Neither affection nor affectation had
power to remoue <hi>these</hi> from their Anchor: for
as <hi>Passions</hi> were the <hi>Billows</hi> they bickred with,
and did encounter; so <hi>vertue</hi> was their <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi>
where, after long Sayle, they expected
Harbour. Here shows <hi>Homer</hi> himselfe an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
<hi>Sophocles;</hi> and there <hi>Sophocles</hi> a tragicke
<hi>Homer:</hi> where the wide world was their <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

Trophie of renowme. <hi>These</hi> deserued memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls
aboue the date of time; Monuments
more lasting then Age. Mettalls are of short
perpetuitie; <hi>These,</hi> because eterniz'd by <hi>vertue,</hi>
succeede to eternitie. My wish is, that my oyle
