            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

visited, and that is <hi>Gesture. Aristotle</hi> (saith he) <hi>ingeniosè &amp; solertèr, corporis fabricam, dum quiescit, tractavit, eandem in motu, nimirum gestus corporis, omisit,</hi> that is, he hath very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously and diligently handled the <hi>factures</hi> of the Body, but not the <hi>Gestures</hi> of the Body, which are no lesse comprehensible by Art, and of great use and advantage, as being no small part of civill prudence. For, the lineaments of the Body doe disclose the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inclination of the minde in generall; but the motions doe not only so, but doe further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close the present humour and state of the minde and will; for as the
<pb facs="tcp:110295:6"/>
Tongue speaketh to the Eare, so <hi>Gesture</hi> speaketh to the Eye, and therefore a number of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose Eyes doe dwell upon the Faces and fashions of men, do well know the advantage of this observation, as being most part of their ability; neither can it bee denied but that it is a great disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of dissimulation, and great direction in businesse. For, after one manner almost we clappe our <hi>Hands</hi> in joy, wring them in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, advance them in prayer and admiration; shake our Head in disdaine, wrinkle our Forehead in dislike, crispe our nose in anger, blush in shame, and so for the most part of the more subtile motions.
<pb facs="tcp:110295:6"/>
Taking (therefore) from hence my Hint, I shal attempt to advance in the scrutinie and search after the scattered glances, and touches of Antiquity, tracing them through most classicall Authors, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to reduce them into one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and intire History, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this form to my self, to handle <hi>Gesture,</hi> as the only speech and generall language of Humane Nature. For ballast to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to make the matter in <hi>Hand</hi> more sollid and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I shall annex consultations with Nature, affording a glosse of their causes: And for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther embellishing thereof, I shall inrich most points of expression
<pb facs="tcp:110295:7"/>
with examples both of Sacred and prophane Authority, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially drawne from Poets and Historians, the only great Doctors in this point of Humane litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; wherein, by the way, I shall lay claime to all metaphors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiall translations or usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all kinde of symbolicall Elegancies taken and borrowed from Gestures of the Body, with the depredations the subtiler Arts of Speech have made upon them for the advancement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of their particular inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and designes. All these (together with the civill rites, and ceremonious customes and fashions of divers Nations in their
<pb facs="tcp:110295:7"/>
nationall expressions by Gesture, with the personall properties and genuine habits particular men) being but as so many severall lines that meet in an angle, and touch in this point; I intend to reduce and bring home to their fountaine and common parent the Body of man. Two Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theaters there are in the Body, whereon most of these patheticall subtilties are exhibited by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in way of <hi>discovery</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> proceeding either from the effect of sufferance, or the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motions of the Minde, which effect those impressions on the parts which wee call the Speaking Motions, or Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

Gestures, and naturall Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Body, to wit, the <hi>Hand</hi> and the <hi>Head;</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer whereof, I intend two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of the observations, falling within the compasse of their particular Districts, under the generall Titles of <hi>Chirolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> and <hi>Cephalelogia, The naturall language of the Hand,</hi> and <hi>The naturall language of the Head;</hi> and these two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the best part of the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Humane Nature. <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomia,</hi> or the <hi>Rule of the Hand</hi> is adjoyned as the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and sublimation of <hi>Chirolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;</hi> as <hi>Cephalenomia,</hi> or the <hi>Rule of the Head,</hi> is to appeare with

What I finde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in the naturall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the other parts, I shall refer to a generall Rendevouze, wherein I shall take a muster of the Postures and Gestures of the Body in generall.

<pb facs="tcp:110295:16"/>
signe, they will believe the voice of the latter signe: (and as there is in the supernaturall, so there is a signifying voyce in the naturall signes of the <hi>Hand.) Althusius</hi> calls these miraculous <note place="margin">Althusius de civili conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, li. 1.</note> expressions of the <hi>Hand, habitus portentosos,</hi> which by their rare and illustrious action denote and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse some singular and memorable intention by the command of God, besides their naturall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. For, the <hi>Hand</hi> being the <hi>Substitute</hi> and <hi>Vicegerent</hi> of the Tongue, in a full, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestique way of expression, presents the <hi>signifying faculties</hi> of the soule, and the inward discourse of Reason: and as <hi>another Tongue,</hi> which we may justly call the <hi>Spokesman</hi> of the Body, it <hi>speakes</hi> for all the members thereof, denoting their <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages,</hi> and including their <hi>Votes.</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thought can be delivered, or made <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly manifest,</hi> by the united motions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native endeavours of all the other members: the same may be as evidently exhibited by the sole devoyre, and <hi>discoursing gestures</hi> of the <hi>Hand.</hi> The intendments of which demonstrative ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures (being naturall signes) have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on any ordinance or Statute of Art, which may be broken off, or taken <hi>in hand;</hi> as it is either repealed, or stands in force: but these being part of the unalterable Lawes and Institutes of Nature, are by their owne perpetuall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by a native consequence significant. As smoke which in darke vapours expires from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed fuell is a certaine signe of fire; or as rich smells by whose aromatique breath the ayer's perfum'd, doe sweetly declare the presence of the ascended odour: and as the blushes of <hi>Aurora</hi> bewray the early approach of the bright Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110295:16"/>
of the day: So that in these Art hath no <hi>Hand,</hi> since they proceed from the meere instinct of Nature: and all these motions and habits of the <hi>Hand</hi> are purely naturall, not positive; nor in their senses remote from the true nature of the things that are implyed. The naturall resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and congruity of which expressions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from the habits of the minde, by the effort of an impetuous affection wrought in the invaded <hi>Hand,</hi> which is made very plyant for such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. But whereas these speaking Organs are couplets, an active paire; sometimes they both, and not seldome one alone doth by a neat insinuation of speech, make and accomplish the habit. Sometimes differing words, which visibly grow on one root of action, goe for Synonima's in gesture: and we shall sometimes see contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of patheticall expression, in identity of posture.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the <hi>Hand</hi> in one speech or kinde of language serve to intimate and expresse our mind: It speakes all languages, and as an <hi>universall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Reason,</hi> is generally understood and knowne by all Nations, among the formall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of their Tongue. And being the onely speech that is naturall to Man, it may well be called the <hi>Tongue and generall language of Humane Nature,</hi> which, without teaching, men in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the habitable world doe at the first sight most easily understand. This is evident by that trade and commerce with those salvage Nations who have long injoy'd the late discovered prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities of the West, with whom (although their Language be strange and unknowne) our Merchants barter and exchange their Wares,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110295:17"/>
driving a rich and silent Trade, by signes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many a dumb bargaine without the crafty Brocage of the Tongue, is advantageously made. Hence 'tis apparent, that there's no native law, or absolute necessity, that those thoughts which arise in our pregnant minde, must by mediation of our Tongue flow out in a vocall streame of words; unto which purpose we must attend the leisure of that inclosed instrument of speech: Since whatsoever is perceptible unto sense, and capable of a due and fitting difference; hath a naturall competency to expresse the motives and affections of the Minde; in whose labours, the <hi>Hand,</hi> which is a ready Midwife, takes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the thoughts from the forestalled Tongue, making a more quicke dispatch by gesture: for when the fancy hath once wrought upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> our conceptions are display'd and utter'd in the very moment of a thought. For, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the <hi>Hand</hi> many times gives a hint of our intention, and speakes out a good part of our meaning, before our words, which accompany or follow it, can put themselves into a vocall posture to be understood. And as in the report of a Piece, the eye being the nimbler sense, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scernes the discharge before any intelligence by conduct of the vocall Wave arrive at the eare; although the flash and the report are twins born at the instant of the Pieces going off: so although Speech and Gesture are conceived together in the minde, yet the <hi>Hand</hi> first appearing in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, anticipates the Tongue, in so much as many times the Tongue perceiving her self fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall'd, spares it selfe a labour; to prevent a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Tautologie: And if words ensue upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110295:17"/>
gesture, their addition serves but as a Comment for the fuller explication of the manuall Text of utterance; and implyes nothing over and above but a generall devoyre of the minde to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly understood. A notable argument we have of this <hi>discoursing facultie</hi> of the <hi>Hand</hi> in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Jesters, who without their voice, speaking onely by gestures, can counterfeit the manners, fashions, and significant actions of men. Which may be more confirm'd by that wonder of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Tis parallel to this, what Natures grand Inquisitor reports of certaine Nations, that have no other language <note place="margin">Plin. Hist.

                     <note place="margin">Seneca de Ira lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> will not allow their motions to be affections, but certain characters &amp; impressions <hi>ad similitudinem passionum,</hi> like unto passions in men, which he calleth <hi>impetus,</hi> the risings, forces and impulsions of Nature, upon the view of such objects as are apt to strike any impressions upon it: yet as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne</hi> (in that elegant Essay of his, where he in <note place="margin">Montaign Essay in Raimond Sebond.</note> imitation of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> maintaines that Beasts participate with us in the rationality of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses) shewes, that even they that have no voyce at all, by their reciprocall kindnesse, which we see in them, we easily inferre there are some other meanes of entercommunication: their

gestures treat, and their motions discourse.

                  <p>And why not (saith he) as well as our dumbe men dispute and tell histories by signes? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (as he well observeth) there is a society and communion of justice, fellowship, good wil, and affection betweene us and Brutes: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not so remote from good nature, gentlenesse, and sweet converse, but that they can expresse their desire of honour, generositie, industrious sagacity, courage, magnanimity, and their love and feare; neither are they void of subtilty and wisedome. For by reason of their affinity as it were, and daily conversation with men, they get a tincture from us of our manners and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and consequently enjoy a kinde of nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and teaching discipline, and apprentising by imitation, which does enable them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and expresse themselves in this language of gesture, teaching us by learning of us, that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable they be not onely of the inward discourse of Reason, but of the outward gift of utterance by gesture: and if there be some gestures of ours that they doe not understand, so there are some of theirs which need an Interpretor, a greater Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique in their language then <hi>Democritus Melam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> or <hi>Apollonius Thyaneus</hi> were, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood all the idiomes of Birds and Beasts, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them unto us. <hi>Plato</hi> in setting out the golden Age under <hi>Saturne,</hi> reckons among the chiefest advantages, this kinde of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And indeed it is a kinde of knowledge that

                     <hi>Adam</hi> partly lost with his innocency, yet might be repaired in us, by a diligent observation and marking of the outward effects of the inward and secret motions of beasts.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>naturall Language of the Hand,</hi> as it had the happinesse to escape the curse at the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Babel: so it hath since been sanctified and made a holy language by the expressions of our Saviours <hi>Hands;</hi> whose gestures have given a sacred allowance to the naturall significations of ours. And God speakes to us by the signes of his <hi>Hand</hi> (as <hi>Bernard</hi> observes) when he works wonders, which are the proper signes of his <hi>Hand. Hic est Digitus Dei,</hi> say the astonished <hi>Magi,</hi> when they acknowledged the expression of a Divine <hi>Hand.</hi> These signes in <hi>Bernards</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <note place="margin">Bernard. lib. 2. in Cantica.</note> are <hi>notae stelliferae,</hi> blazing and Starrie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. In another Dialect of his <hi>Divine Hand</hi> he expresses his revealed will to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets by inspiration, as <hi>Ribera</hi> notes: which the <note place="margin">Ribera comment. in Proph. M. Beda lib. de Indig tatione.</note> Prophets in Scripture acknowledge to be the still voice of the <hi>Hand</hi> of the Lord. <hi>Bede</hi> takes notice of another Dialect or way of expression which God useth with his <hi>Hand,</hi> when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades men, working upon them by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good workes. After this manner Christ our Lord to his doctrine added the signes of his <hi>Hand,</hi> that is, his workes: according to that of the Evangelist, <hi>Iesus began</hi> to <hi>doe</hi> and <hi>teach.</hi> And <note place="margin">Act. 1. 1</note> as God speakes to us with his <hi>Hand</hi> by a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall way: so we naturally speake to Him, as well as unto men, by the <hi>appeale</hi> of our <hi>Hands</hi> in <hi>admiration, attestation,</hi> and <hi>prayer.</hi> Nay when we are beyond the vocall lines of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with men, and that distance of place hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110295:19"/>
made the highest tone of our Tongue too low to reach the auditory nerve of one that is remote: or when the noise of some eare-deafing crowd hath rendred our Tongue unserviceable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our minde; we use the visible expressions of our <hi>Hand,</hi> as more loud and demonstrative, which are afarre off perceived and understood by those who were uncapable of an auricular inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And as concerning those <hi>manuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> which we use to those are lesse distant from us, the <hi>Hand</hi> is so ready and cunning to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound our intentions, abounding in a sense so copious, and so connaturall a kind of eloquence, wherein all things are so lively exprest; the <hi>Hand</hi> seemes to enter into contestation, and to vie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses with the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and to over-match it in speaking labours, and the significant varietie of important motions, that it almost transcends the faculty of Art to enumerate the postures of the <hi>Hand,</hi> and the <hi>discoursing gestures</hi> which present the interpretation of the Minde.

                        <p>TO RAISE THE HAND CONIOYNED OR SPREAD OUT TOWARDS HEAVEN is the  habit of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and a naturall and universall forme of <hi>Prayer,</hi> practised by those who are in <hi>adversity,</hi> and in <hi>bitter anguish of Minde;</hi> and by those who <hi>give publique thankes and praise to the most High.</hi> Thus we <hi>acknowledge our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, aske mercy, beg reliefe, pay our vowes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate, complaine, submit, invoke,</hi> and <hi>are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant.</hi> Hence 'tis the Scriptures doe most em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8</note> define <hi>prayer</hi> by this outward signe, not that this speaking habit of the <hi>Hand</hi> is all or the most principall part of <hi>devotion,</hi> for, Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, as if fired with <hi>zeale,</hi> EXTEND THEIR ARMES AND HANDS, who yet but mock God by seeming to <hi>draw nigh</hi> unto Him, when their Hearts belie their <hi>Hands.</hi> But, this gesture is an outward helpe unto <hi>devotion,</hi> appointed by the ordinance of Nature to expresse the <hi>holy fervour of our affections.</hi> For since it is impossible by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our great infirmitie, we should with our soaring thoughts move beyond the centre of our bodies; we stand in need of some outward help to declare the <hi>ascension of our inward zeale,</hi> which we reveale by the EXTENSION OF OUR HANDS, which supplying the place of wings, helpe our hearts in their flight upward.

So upon that of the Psalmist, I will <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 4.</note> LIFT UP MY HANDS in thy Name, hee doth not take it for the habit of <hi>praying,</hi> but for a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a worke of a high elevation. So likewise upon such a passage of another Psalme: Let my <note place="margin">Psa. 140. 2.</note> prayer be set forth before thee as incense, and the LIFTING UP OF MY HANDS as the <hi>evening Sacrifice.</hi> He shewes that the Apostle where he <note place="margin">S. Paul to Timoth.</note> exhorts them to LIFT UP pure <hi>Hands,</hi> hee does not appoint a habit of <hi>praying,</hi> but addes a rule of <hi>divine operation.</hi> So the noble Prophet, <note place="margin">Isaiah.</note> when you SPREAD FORTH YOUR HANDS, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make many <hi>prayers</hi> I will not heare: if you EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEND YOUR HANDS, not if you LIFT THEM UP; but if you EXTEND YOUR HANDS: because the habit of <hi>praier</hi> is in the SPREAD OUT HANDS; but the power of a perfect worke is in the ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATION.

Idolaters and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, in LIFTING UP THEIR HANDS in prayer, are but Apes, who while they by the outward Symbol professe to have their mindes erected upwards, the first of them sticke in the wood and stone, as if God were inclosed there: the second sort intangled in vaine cares, or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cogitations, lye groveling on the earth, and by a contradiction of gesture, beare witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves.</p>

                        <p>S. <hi>Augustine</hi> very elegantly and sweetly gives us the retionality and religious conveniency of this manuall expression. When men in prayer <note place="margin">S.

And indeed this outward addition or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct of <hi>Piety,</hi> the OPENING and LIFTING UP OF THE HANDS is a naturall manifestation of the <hi>uprightnesse</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of the heart, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110295:27"/>
of the <hi>sincerity</hi> of the affections. For deceit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hath no wil, though hypocrisie sometimes may affect to dilate and extend the <hi>Hand.</hi> And the sympathy is so strong betweene the <hi>Heart</hi> and the <hi>Hand,</hi> that a holy thought can no sooner inlarge the erected Heart, but it workes upon the <hi>Hands</hi> which are RAISED to this expression, and EXTENDED OUT TO THE UTTERMOST OF THEIR CAPACITIES. Upon this naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or exposition of the minde, Saint <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> sets a morall glosse. This LIFTING UP OF OUR HANDS should put us in mind to take heed <note place="margin">S. Chrys. Moral.</note> of sin, lest we defile our <hi>Hands</hi> therewith. Since it is very absurd, that those who are to bee the Trouchmen and Interpretours of prayer and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine administrations, should also be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of wickednesse: for if we say it is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest for a man to pray with dirty and unwashen <hi>Hands;</hi> how much more naughtinesse will that expression be tainted with, to LIFT UP HANDS not dirty, but defiled with the pollutions of sin. And in this sense washing of <hi>Hands</hi> was used by most Nations before prayer. This <hi>Manuall of Prayer</hi> as a helpe <hi>at Hand,</hi> the Christians in all ages have diversly used for the furthering their <hi>devotion,</hi> as may be collected out of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall records of Time. <hi>Tertullian</hi> renders a <note place="margin">Tertul. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

notice of most of the expressions of this gesture of the <hi>Hand.</hi> That it is significant in the six first senses, may bee collected out of many ancient Writers.

might see him, and when he saw his voice could not be heard of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> hee made a signe with his <hi>Hand</hi> that hee had some matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to tell him. <hi>Tiberius</hi> [who soone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood this gesture of his <hi>Hand,]</hi> bade them make a lane through the preasse.

bound by an oath, but by HOLDING UP THE HAND, and with great acclamation of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected multitude.

Then all of them HELD UP THEIR HANDS. And <hi>Xenophon</hi> arising againe to speake, concludes thus: Who <hi>assents</hi> to these things, let him HOLD UP HIS HAND, which they did accordingly.

The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> respective to this signification of gesture, saith, That the King of <note place="margin">Isa. 10. 32.</note> Assyria should SHAKE HIS HAND against the mount of the daughter of Sion. And because men are wont to use this expression by gesture to those they hold <hi>worthy of rebuke</hi> and <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that being <hi>terrified</hi> thereby they might <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim</hi> them from vice. Hence by an <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia</hi> in many places of Scripture this gesture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the <hi>chastizing Hand</hi> of God. To this signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication belongs that of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> In <note place="margin">Isa. 19. 16.</note> that day shall Aegypt be like unto women; and it shall be afraid and feare, because of the SHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KING OF THE HAND of the Lord of Hosts, which he shaketh over it. To this also belongs

that of the same Prophet, With his mighty wind <note place="margin">Idem cap 11. ver. 15.</note> shall he SHAKE HIS HAND over the river. And the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> to the same signification, Behold, I will SHAKE MINE HAND upon <note place="margin">Zach. 2. 9.</note> them.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110295:56"/>
having beene tooke notice of by ancient Chronologers: for, the <hi>Hand</hi> according to the primitive intention of Nature, having by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consent of Nations beene ever chosen Chronologer of al remarkable actions, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently proved its own Biographer. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we but cast an intuitive eye upon those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials the Right <hi>Hand</hi> of Time hath left fairly noted in the Left Palme of Antiquity, even by the old autography of the <hi>Hand,</hi> wee may spell out the sense of this naturall expression. For when <hi>Valentinian</hi> had a full purpose to adorne his sonne <hi>Gratian,</hi> a pretty young stripling, and <note place="margin">Ammian. Marcellin. lib. 7.</note> well growne, with the Imperiall Ensignes, when he had wrought the Souldiers to accept thereof, hee ascended up the Tribunall, and taking the youth by the Right <hi>Hand,</hi> hee brought him up before them, and in a publique Oration <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> him (as ordained Emperour) to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Another Copie of this naturall gesture we finde in the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> refusing in modesty the Empire; pretending his age and meane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent: <note place="margin">Herodian. lib. 2.</note> who taking <hi>Glabrio</hi> by the <hi>Hand,</hi> and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him forth, placed him in the Imperiall Throne, <hi>recommending</hi> him as more fit for the Empire. And <hi>Commodus</hi> in a speech he made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Souldiers of his Army, puts them in minde <note place="margin">Idem l. 1.</note> how his father <hi>Marcus</hi> when hee was an infant, carried him in his armes, and delivered him into their <hi>Hands, recommending</hi> him (as it were) to their tutelage and fidelity. Thus also <hi>Tiberius</hi> (though with dissimulation) tooke <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Drusus, Germanicus</hi> children, by the <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Tacitus Annal. l. 3.</note> them to the care of the Senate in a dissembling Oration he made. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110295:56"/>
                           <hi>Hystaspas</hi> by the Right <hi>Hand,</hi> gave her unto his <note place="margin">Xenoph. de Cyr. inst. lib. 8.</note> friend <hi>Gobrias,</hi> who having stretched out his <hi>Hand</hi> before, received her at his <hi>Hands.</hi> And this expression <hi>Raguel</hi> used when he gave his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Sarah</hi> to wife to young <hi>Tobias,</hi> an expression <note place="margin">Tob. 7. 13</note> which delivered from <hi>Hand</hi> to <hi>Hand</hi> is one of the solemne rites of Matrimony to be used by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Bride.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110295:57"/>
a female, and one of riper yeares, 'tis significant to present an officious and tender respect or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable affection. The aspiring affectation of women raised by Choppines to an artificiall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of stature, hath made this courtly garb of gesture more necessary and commodious to great Ladies, and hath preferr'd it to bee one of the eight parts of speech of a Gentleman-ushers Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence.

                        <p>¶ But as concerning that perillous striking of the <hi>Hand</hi> for others, <hi>Salomon</hi> who was well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the subtle notions of manuall utterance, acknowledging the signification thereof in sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship, discommends the inconvenient and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory force of this expression: My sonne, if thou <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 1.</note> be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy <hi>Hand</hi> with a stranger, thou art snared, &amp;c. And in another place: Be not thou of those that strike <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 6</note> 
                           <hi>Hands,</hi> or of them that are sureties for debts. And the Wiseman striking again with the same <hi>Hand</hi> of reprehension: A man void of understanding striketh <hi>Hands</hi> and becommeth surety in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his friend. Wherein he checkes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet forwardnesse of some men in these kinde of undertakings, who offer themselves before the favour is required at their <hi>Hands,</hi> and at the very sight of and presence of his friend, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <note place="margin">Dr. Jerm. mins pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphr. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servat. on the Prov.</note> or looking into the businesse, thrusts his <hi>Hands</hi> into the bond of suretiship. And such a man is here describ'd to bee a man wanting a heart, and surely it were well if such a one were without a <hi>Hand</hi> also: for since hee hath not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in his heart to keep him from hurt, it were good he had no power in his <hi>Hand</hi> to doe himselfe hurt: especially if he be such a foole, as having strucken anothers <hi>Hand,</hi> and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a surety, he striketh his owne <hi>Hands</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding himselfe for it, which may be the sense of this place. Surely such a foole may quickly wring his <hi>Hands</hi> together in sorrow, who before did clap his <hi>Hands</hi> in joy, and may strike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in anger with the same <hi>Hand</hi> wherewith in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110295:68"/>
the foolish kindnesse of suretiship he strucke the <hi>Hand</hi> of another. For he that hath strucken his <hi>Hand</hi> to be surety for his friend, had beene better that his friend had strucke him with a harder blow, when by striking his <hi>Hand</hi> he hath brought him, under the <hi>Hand</hi> of another, and <hi>behinde hand</hi> in the world. <hi>Salazar</hi> commenting upon these places of the Proverbs, renders this expression of <note place="margin">Salaz. comment. in Prov.

Variously, sometimes 'tis <hi>Manum desigere, volam percutere, in fidei jubentibus pro debitis manum pepigere, in fidei jussionibus stipulata manu side jubere.</hi> And he calls it sometimes <hi>Sonum securitatis vel assecurationis, scil. eum sonum quem in stipulationis, &amp; fideijussio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, seu assecurationis pacto manus manui conserta, &amp; illisa edore solet.

Therefore when the minde

would disclose the virtue, strength, and forcible operation of her <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>good-will,</hi> out of the abundance of her <hi>love</hi> she puts forth the <hi>Hand,</hi> and in that as it were the <hi>heart</hi> it self, with <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate love;</hi> and receives them againe by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bill of exchange in the <hi>Hand</hi> of another, which verily is a signe of <hi>mutuall agréement,</hi> and of a <hi>perfect conjunction;</hi> for which cause <hi>Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> a Poet of an aspiring wit, placed the heart <note place="margin">Pindarus</note> and <hi>Hand</hi> as relatives under one and the same parallel.

This expression of the <hi>Hand</hi> continues in force and estimation, and beares such sway among all Nations (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those that are Northward) that he seemes to be disarmed of all humanity, and to want the affability of expression, who doth (when there is occasion for it) omit this <hi>benevolent insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Hand.</hi> But concerning this familiar and naturall intimation of the <hi>Hand</hi> in point of <hi>salutation,</hi> the ancient Sages and men of sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est judgement, have made a quaere whether the <hi>familiar</hi> contact bee so comely and laudable in the <hi>Hand</hi> of a prudent and religious man.

And it <note place="margin">Iamblicus</note> appears by the most ancient observations of elder times, that holy men for the most part used in their <hi>salutations</hi> only to put forth the <hi>Hand;</hi> since so, the <hi>singular benevolence</hi> of a <hi>friendly</hi> minde may be expressed without any impeachment to

their virtue and gravity. <hi>Meletius</hi> of Antioch, a man endued with an incredible <hi>easinesse and swéetnesse of manners,</hi> and most deare to all good men, is said only to have put forth his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and gracious <hi>Right Hand</hi> in <hi>salutations,</hi> to shew the force of his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> towards others, wherein he observed the lawes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity, and a <hi>courteous disposition,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any detriment to religious modesty. And at this day religious men in forreigne parts most commonly abstaine from embracing the <hi>Hands</hi> of others, without incurring the censure of incivility, and want of grace in behaviour, as taking the shaking of <hi>Hands</hi> in this sense, to be too <hi>blunt</hi> an expression for a <hi>Hand</hi> accustomed to matters of decorum, and the sacred tokens of divine reverence. ¶ In signe of <hi>congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> the Huntsmen at the fall of the Boore slaine by <hi>Meleager</hi> with cheerfull shouts unfolding their joyes shake his victorious <hi>Hands,</hi> as <hi>Ovid</hi> elegantly feignes according to the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>Hand</hi> on such occasions. ¶ Nothing more ordinary then shaking of <hi>Hands</hi> in <hi>valedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>taking leave</hi> of our friends, and <hi>bidding them farewell,</hi> of which Poets and Historians are not silent. <hi>Ovid</hi> brings in <hi>Cadmus</hi> at his transformation, speaking to his wife <hi>Hermione</hi> to <note place="margin">Ovid Metam. 4.</note> use this loving gesture of <hi>valediction,</hi> and to shake <hi>Hands</hi> with him while he yet had a <hi>Hand</hi> to shake.

                        <p>THE IMPOSITION OF THE HAND, is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall  gesture significantly used in <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, absolution, pardon and forgivenesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, adoption, initiation, confirmation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, ordination, sanation,</hi> and <hi>in gracing our meales.</hi> That this gesture is of importance in <hi>condemnation</hi> is apparent by the commands of the old Law in case of temptation to Ethnicisme <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 9. 17. 7.</note> and practicall Idolatry. So when the sonne of Shelomith the daughter of <hi>Dibri</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> which she had by an Aegyptian) had blasphemed, the Lord by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Levit. 24. 14.</note> commanded him to be brought forth without the campe, and all that heard him were to LAY HIS HAND ON HIS HEAD. And the laying of the <hi>Hand</hi> on the sacrifices head that was <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:110295:84"/>
there is a proper contrariety of expression, and this seems to be a naturall and paraphrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gesture, very sutable to that petition in the Lords prayer, <hi>Forgive</hi> us our trespasses, AS we <hi>forgive</hi> them their trespasses against us. For, AS Nature teacheth us to raise our <hi>Hands</hi> to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgivenesse at the <hi>Hand</hi> of God; so she likewise moves us to the same expression of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, as most proper and significant to <hi>seale our pardons</hi> to others; implying, that who <hi>forgives</hi> shall be forgiven; and neither Nature nor Grace doth move us to aske pardon on any other terms. The phrase of this gesture is significantly tooke into the formes of the Civill Law; and hath been practised in Ecclesiasticall <hi>absolution.

The manner of performance at this day (it seems) is, to lay on both the extended <hi>Hands</hi> upon the head, so that they touch the crowne, and rest and settle downe thereon. ¶ As this gesture is significant in <hi>benediction,</hi> it was used by <hi>Isaac</hi> upon his death-bed when he <hi>blessed</hi> his sonne <hi>Jacob</hi> who supplanted <hi>Esau</hi> of his blessing <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 4</note>

LAID HIS HANDS UPON THEM and blessed them. And the very last expression that flowed from His sacred <hi>Hand</hi> was blessing: for at the time of His ascention He LIFTED UP HIS HANDS and blessed His Apostles, and while <note place="margin">Luke 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence in all tacit posies of His as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, this figure of the sacred property of His <hi>Hand</hi> is most emphatically significant. ¶ That in conferring the blessings of primogeniture and <hi>adoption,</hi> this gesture of the Right <hi>Hand</hi> is more peculiarly significant, is excellently illustrated by the adoption of <hi>Ephraim</hi> unto the birthright of <hi>Manasseth</hi> by <hi>Jacob</hi> when he blessed <hi>Joseph</hi> sons: <note place="margin">Gen. 48. 8.</note> For, <hi>Joseph</hi> bringing his sonnes to be blessed of his father, tooke <hi>Ephraim</hi> in his <hi>Right Hand</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Israels</hi> left hand; and <hi>Manasses</hi> in his left hand, towards <hi>Israels Right Hand,</hi> so he brought them unto him: But <hi>Israel</hi> STRETCHED OUT HIS RIGHT HAND, and laid it on <hi>Ephraims</hi> head which was the younger, and his left hand upon <hi>Manasses</hi> head (directing his <hi>Hands</hi> on purpose) for <hi>Manasses</hi> was the elder. But when <hi>Joseph</hi> saw
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:110295:85"/>
that his father laid his <hi>Right Hand</hi> on the head of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it displeased him, and he staid his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Hand</hi> to remove it from <hi>Ephraims</hi> head to <hi>Manasses</hi> head.

                        <p>And it is a brand of prophane unmannerlines in the rough <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Esau</hi> that he was readier to strike <hi>Hand</hi> with a chapman to sell Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing for his meat, then with his <hi>Hand</hi> to invite it to his meate. Whereas our Blessed Saviour thought blessing (bid by this reverend invitation of the <hi>Hand)</hi> a considerable guest at a feast, who to shew that man liveth not by bread only, upon all such occasions used the signification of this gesture. Thus He blessed the five loaves and <note place="margin">Mark. 6. 41.</note> two fishes wherewith he wrought his feeding miracle. And from this Chireulogia or act of blessing and giving thanks the Sacrament used at His last supper, is called the Eucharist.

And the finger was used in all dippings and sprinklings of the Leviticall Law.

illustrious aides of Pronunciation; no marvell that so few Rhetoricians have left any Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts of the Conformation of gesture; this artifice of the <hi>Hand</hi> being a thing so common, and as it were naturall unto them. Which vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility of a prompt &amp; easie nature, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accommodating it selfe to all things, made the Satyrist say, that the whole Nation <note place="margin">Juvenal.

And as they were very studious in all kinds of literature; when they apply'd their minds to eloquence, it cannot be said how they excel'd in gesture, by the force and guide of Nature; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance was the cause why the Stagerite said, <gap reason="foreign">

For else, he had <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in his eyes, a man wholly composed of this Artifice, and turn'd after a manner, upon the wheele of Rhetorique: who at first, by reason of his naturall imperfection herein, was much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged: by which it appeares, that an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is not borne, but made: and to speake well and laudably, there is need of studie and striving, before the facultie can be attained. For as for this opinion of ignorant men, who thinke that Gestures are perfect enough by Nature, and that the climate availes nothing, it being not materiall whether the <hi>Hand</hi> be moved hither or thither: that every one may please himselfe, observing no rule or admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rhetoricians: The daily Example of speakers refute.

and prophane places, so preposterously &amp; ilfavoredly expressing their minds, that 'tis a wonder how any eye can behold them with attention. Certainly, men polished with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, cannot without loathing, behold the praevarications of such durty and slovenly Oratours, and with a just indignation distaste their inconsiderate action. If the Naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were absolutely compleat, &amp; sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit to open &amp; unfold the sense of the Mind; or were accommodated to gaine good will, or opportune for the incredible force and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of the affections; would these goodly Orators and lovers of faire speech so bewray themselves, and wallow in the dirt? But this is enough, to prove that the actions of the <hi>Hand</hi> are not perfect by Nature. Therefore let those upstart and tumultuarie Oratours bragge as much as they will, of the force of Nature, and facilitie of Gestures. Reason, and the sayings of the learned Ancients doe not onely gainsay them, but prove these Cosme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique gestures of the <hi>Hand</hi> to be things of great moment, &amp; the very Palme and Crown of Eloquence.

This is sufficiently proved by the old emulation between that famous Oratour <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Roscius</hi> the great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Master in the Art of Action; for it is certaine that most eminent Oratour would often contend and strive avie with <hi>Roscius</hi> whether he should more often expresse the same sentence in gesture; or whether he himselfe by the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of his cloquence in a differing speech and variety of expression pronounce the same; which raised <hi>Roscius</hi> to that height and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of knowledge, that he wrote a booke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he compared Eloquence with the Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Stage-players: And indeed the fame and estimation of <hi>Roscius</hi> grew hereupon so great, that learned Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

one can farre more wittily expresse a thing by a dumbe externall action, then by a lively inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall invention, more by gestures then jests.

                  <p>Such (as <hi>Sconerus</hi> notes) was the action of the Prophets and Ecclesiasticall Oratours in the Primitive times, plainly Heroique, as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of Sacred Writ, and some Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators thereon, in whom the Eloquence of the Prophets is graphically described.</p>
                  <p>Nature exhorts all men to Action consentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the stile of their Elocution: which inbred and commodious propensitie, unlesse illustrated by Art, and confirmed by exercitation, is, as <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pezuntius</hi> notes, but as a field untill'd, which runs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110295:131"/>
wild with disorder'd productions. Art being the Imitator which perfects Nature, makes her actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s more dilucid, illustrious and sweet, by her positive accommodations. For whatsoever Nature doth institute in the individuals worthy observation, reduced into one exact idea, built upon generall precepts, by a perpetuall order, Art doth expose under one aspect of the Understanding: And Nature againe placed by Art, beholds the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent actions of eminent men, and expresses them by a happy exercitation. Wherefore the ancient Rhetoricians, who cast their eyes upon Nature, and insisted in her steps, whose Art was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally bent to imitate the severall actions of the Mind with a decent and comely grace; admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no gesture to the <hi>hand,</hi> but what they did find by an accurate collation to have some similitude with the truth of Nature. That which <hi>Philostratus Junior</hi> requires of a Painter, who would be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <note place="margin">Philost. jun. de I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conib.</note> by his <hi>Hand,</hi> is more necessary to an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. He would have him that would seeme to manage that Art skilfully, to be a man endued with a good fancy and a sound judgement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively apt to every thing, and industrious in the observing of mens natures, and assimilating their manners, and counterfeiting of all things which in the gesture and composition of the body, are the signes and notes of the tacite mind and affections. And indeed, then shall the hand of an eloquent man move aptly, and as to the purpose applyed to expresse what he takes in hand, when he hath converst with Nature, and insinuated himselfe into all the veines of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>Hand,</hi> &amp; by diligent study hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to an exquisite experience in the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of the fingers, and what the naturall motions of the <hi>Hand</hi> are wont to be. Hence Philosophers, who can discern of the naturall causes of things, have a notable advantage: for he shall most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly &amp; judiciously manage his <hi>Hand,</hi> &amp; mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the gestures thereof, who by the discipline of Philosophie shall apply and conforme himselfe neerest to the nature &amp; varietie of the affections.</p>

There is a Colossus at Rome, which in times past stood in the Baines of <hi>Anthony,</hi> the left hand whereof leaneth upon a club; but the two first <hi>Fingers</hi> of the <hi>Right Hand</hi> extended out with the Thumbe, such as of old time was the gesture of Oratours speaking, as <hi>Grutterus</hi> notes, which most authenticall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of speech they seem to have followed, whose <note place="margin">Grutterus in Sylloge inscript.</note> 
                        <hi>Hand</hi> the golden History of the Crosse in Cheap was, for there were to be seene two statues of mitred Prelates having their <hi>Hands</hi> figured in this manner, as if they were speaking to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

in all ancient painted tables where any counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of speech is exhibited, nothing so obvious and remarkable as this Rhetoricall posture of the <hi>Fingers.</hi> And the inventions and painted Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our moderne Artists in their representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of speech had in publicke, have a constant relation and respect unto this ancient forme of the <hi>Fingers.</hi> And over the ancient images of the Prophets, which pollished by the <hi>Hands</hi> of the Jesuits, come over to us from the Mart, there is usually a <hi>Hand</hi> extended out of Heaven, impail'd about with rayes, the <hi>Fingers</hi> retaining this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, as it were the <hi>Index</hi> of God speaking to his Prophets, as He was wont to doe of old, when He stirred up their hearts, and suggested His sacred Oracles unto them. For since they could not by any fitting semblance or fancied pourtraiture of inventive wit, describe God as He is in Himselfe; lest impiety should have tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their imagination, and they should seeme to make the Prophet equall to his God, they would not by a grosse discription shadow out God speaking Face to face, because the Face pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Person, <hi>Nudam Divinam Essentiam,</hi> as <hi>Brixian;</hi> cleerly as he is in Himselfe: but Hee <note place="margin">Ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>TO use the left hand commonly as principall  in Action, which should be at most but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory, is the idle property of one destitute of all Artifice, and common notions; and of one that would seem to speake in despite of the advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Ancients; a strange errour in the <hi>Hand</hi> of Orator, yet observed &amp; condemned by <hi>Cresollius</hi> in some pretenders to divine Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, <note place="margin">Cresol. Vac.

Neither is there any cause why in the education <note place="margin">Plutarch of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children.</note> of Noble-mens children it is diligently given in charge, that they feed themselves with the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> yea, &amp; nurses use to rebuke infants, if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily they put forth their left; which precept is drawne out of honesty it selfe, and nature, and hath ever beene in use with those Nations who have addicted themselves to humanity, and good manners. Hence the Aegyptians, because in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and casting account, they frame their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and lay their counters from the <hi>Right Hand</hi> to the left; and the Grecians (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> notes) coutrariwise, from the left to the <hi>Right;</hi> used to <note place="margin">Herodot.</note>

We know that commonly in <note place="margin">Cresol. de gest. orat.</note> combats the left hand, is it were affixed to the body, manageth the shield, and staying as it were at home quiet; the <hi>Right Hand</hi> shewes it selfe forth, and is occupied in doing and giving the charge.

And because the left hand of it selfe is of very small dignity in pronunciation, common humanity doth teach us, that as a Virgin shut up in her chamber, it should be modestly concealed; the <hi>Right Hand</hi> on the contrary, as a most goodly Scepter of Reason, with its force and weight, doth much among men.</p>
                     <p>But although this praevarication of acting with the Left hand in chiefe, be an errour so grosse, that we cannot away with it even in picture, where an imitation of speech is exprest: Yet there might be a <hi>Quaere</hi> rais'd, what toleration might be granted to such who are Left-handed or Ambodexters by nature or custome.

The same levitie or faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of imitation <hi>Libanius</hi> the Sophister had, who was called by those of his times, the very painted Map of mens manners and dispositions.</p>

                     <p>IN all Action, Nature beares the greatest sway:  Every man must consider his own Nature and temperament. The reason is, because no man can put off his own, and put on anothers nature. One Action becomes one man, and another kind of behaviour, another. That which one does without Art, cannot wholly be delivered by Art; for there is a kind of hidden and ineffable reason, which to know, is the head of Art. In some, the Civill vertues themselves have no grace: in others, even the vices of Rhetorique are comely and pleasing. Wherefore a Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician must know himselfe, yet not by common precepts; but he must take counsell of Nature for the framing of the complexionall and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall properties of his <hi>Hand,</hi>

                     <p>IN the Rhetoricall endeavours of the <hi>Hand,</hi> as in all other Actions, the golden Mediocrie is  best, and most worthy the <hi>hand</hi> of a prudent man. For the action of the <hi>Hand</hi> should be full of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and magnanimous resolution, making it a liberall and free Index of the Minde; such as theirs is, who are said by <hi>Xenophon</hi> to be inspired with divine love, who (as he sayes) <hi>gestus ad</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Xenoph. in Symp.</note> 
                        <hi>speciem quandam maximè liberalem conformant.</hi> Which forme of apparence consists in a certaine moderation of gesture, no chafed and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed rashnes, or a too daring garbe of action, nor superfinicall demeanour: nor on the other side, a rustique and homely fearfulnesse, which is wont to discourage and disappoint the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of necessary motion. Yet of the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, it is least faulty to draw nigh to modestie, and an ingenuous feare, than to impudencie. The manner and tempering of gesture, is not onely to be fetched from the things themselves, but also from the age and condition of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: for otherwise a Philosopher, or some grave person: otherwise a young Sophister, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up with study, and boyling over with the fervencie of an active spirit. A soft and calme action most commonly becomes grave men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with authoritie: which to one in the flower of his youth, would be accounted slownes, and a slacking negligence. Modification of gesture hath also regard to the condition and qualitie of the Auditours; for an Oratour should first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, with whom, and in whose presence he is about to act: for in the Senate, or hearing of a Prince, another action is required than in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to a Congregation of the people, or an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:110295:193"/>
assembly of light young men. Among Kings, and Potentates, and Fathers of the Court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had to their illustrious power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, all juvenile gestient pompe and ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid aside, by a submisse Action he must transferre all dignity from himselfe. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this golden point of <hi>moderation,</hi> there is a Nationall decorum imposed upon men by <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place;</hi> for according to the Genius of that climate, wherein we converse, <hi>moderation,</hi> may admit of a divers construction. In Italy a faire spoken, and overmuch gesturing with the <hi>Hand,</hi> is held comely and acceptable. And in France he is not a <hi>la mode,</hi> and a compleat <hi>Mounsieur,</hi> who is not nimble in the discoursing garbe of his <hi>Hand,</hi> which proportionable to that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is very briske, and full of quicke and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some expressions. And your French Protestant Divines are easily good Chirologers, some I have lately seen in the Pulpit, to my great satisfaction, and have gone away more confirmed in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of these Rhetoricall gestures, there being scarce any one gesture that I have cut, but I have seene used in the heat of one discourse of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemicall Divinity, such Logicall asseverations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their <hi>Hands.</hi> In Germany, and with us here in England, who in our Nationall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion are neare ally'd unto the Germans, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> and gravity, in gesture, is esteemed the greater virtue. The Spaniards have another Standert of moderation and gravity accorded to the lofty Genius of Spaine, where the <hi>Hands</hi> are as often principalls, as accessories to their proud expressions. But our language growne now so rich by the indenization of words of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:110295:194"/>
and so altered from the old Teutonique, if the rule of <hi>moderation,</hi> be calculated according to the Meridionall proprietie of our refined speech, we may with decorum and gravitie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (as I suppose) meet the <hi>Hand</hi> of any of these warmer Nations halfe way, with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall</hi> adjuncts of our expressions.</p>
