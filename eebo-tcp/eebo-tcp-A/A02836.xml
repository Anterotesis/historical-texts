            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AY it please your most Excellent Maiestie, this last right worthy attribute of yours (no way insinuated, but iustly affixed to your more ancient stile) perswades these vnworthy papers to presume (with your gracious leaue and permission) to take the hardines to kisse your sacred hands; hoping of the like successe, that some vnripe eares of corne, brought by me from the cold Country of <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> receiued from some honest, well-minded louers of that action when they saw them: who with much-affected ioy often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, tooke much comfort in what they saw: but more, when they suppos'd it might be better'd, by industry, care, and honestie. These few bad vnripe Rimes of mine (comming from thence) are in all humility presented with the like intendiment to your Maiestie, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that the Aire there is not so dull, or maleuolent, but that if bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wits were transplanted thither, neither the Summers heat would dilate them, nor the Winters cold benumme them, but that they might in full vigour flourish to good purpose. For if I now growne dull and aged, could doe somewhat, what will not sharper, younger, freer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions performe there? They would not walke as I here doe, with short turnes, leaning sometimes on others inuentions, skipping weakly from bough to bough; but with large walkes, with long, and strong flights. I suppose it not fit at this time (but attending the successe of this presumption) in some other larger manner to make knowne vnto your Maiestie, the inestimable riches of the <hi>Seas</hi> circuling that <hi>Iland:</hi> The hopefull improuements of the maine Land thereof: The more then probable, vnualuable hidden treasures therein: The infinite aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of combustible fierce materials fit for such an imployment. It is
<pb facs="tcp:6414:3"/>
only the Aire at this time I desire to dignifie, and that which is within that <hi>Horizon:</hi> Yet is my proofe rather in hope of others, then in any actuated performance of mine owne. If your Maiestie will be pleased to giue credit to your meanest subiect, I may ingage my selfe on this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seueration, That not only in this vnprofitable (though not vnpleasant) Art, better wits would thriue there: but all other sollid learning would walke vprightly without conuulsions. I cannot but know, how al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all your Royall houres are taken vp in most Reall, serious, sollid imploiments: did I therefore imagine, that either your Maiestie could, or graciously would vouchsafe the reading of these; they would be found some mine owne, the rest, Translations. Meane and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy though they are, yet because some of them were borne, and the rest did first speake <hi>English,</hi> in that Land whereof your gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie is the right, and lawfull <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> and King, by ancient descent and primary possession, and being the first fruits of this kind, that euer visited this Land, out of that Dominion of yours; I thought it my duty, to present and to prostrate these with my selfe at your Royall feete: For what I haue mistakingly offended herein, or shall hereafter, I humbly beseech your Maiesties gracious, mercifull, generall, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and pardon, vnfeinedly beseeching God to blesse your Maiesty with aboundance of all Earthly and Heauenly blessings. And that you may see an happy successe of all your Forraigne Plantations, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of that of <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> I remaine</p>

For our owne, they are the best we can at this time. The grace and loue I receiued sometime from one of your sexe, makes me confident of your gracious goodnesse: but my <hi>Muse</hi> hath a little recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her spirits, and requests me <hi>She</hi> may speake a little vnto you.</p>
