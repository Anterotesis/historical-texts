            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SIR Beniamin Rudyard his Speech in Parliament, made on Wednesday the twenty ninth day of <hi>December,</hi> concerning the treatie with the <hi>Scottish</hi> Commissioners about the <hi>Irish</hi> affaires, and the Letts and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments that have hindred the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Parliament therein.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Master Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis day is appointed for our giveing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in our request to the <hi>Scottish</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners concerning their assistance of and for the <hi>Irish</hi> affaires. I desire Sir to speake som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what under favour concerning the same.</p>
            <p>Wee see the danger and necessity of our aide they are in, and wee have had much hinderance in our expediting of our assistance for that service which I intend to remember you off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96704:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The first Lett or impediment that hath hindred our proceedings in that businesse, is the disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the two houses or the causes of their disagreement, I perswade my selfe is the Bishops and such Lords as favour them, and I conceive that unlesse they bee speedily brought to tryall, and by the sword of Iustice taken out of the way, those that shall be so Condemned by the Parliament and the rest of them, with those Lords that favour them may bee removed from the presence of his Majestie (by whom hee is mis-councelled, and his minde somewhat averted from Complying so willingly with the Parliament as otherwise it is conceaved hee would bee, this Statute cannon bee secure from great danger.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a second Lett is the dirision, and often disagreement amongst our selves not knowne these many yeares in Parliament of former yeares.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the multiplicity of Petitions daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the House irregularly taking up a great deale of time in answering.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the great danger this Kingdome is in through the practizes of Priests and Iesuites, and all of the Popish Religion is a maine cause of the slow proceedings in the <hi>Irish</hi> affaires. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Pollitiquely concerning that it was most necessary to provide first for the security of this Kingdom, whereof they be the chiefest, before allyances and in doing that they have spent a great deale of time: and I wish our consultations, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and lawes we make may be the firme setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96704:3"/>
in good order all things that are amisse both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the delay in execution of the Priests lately condemned hinders somewhat our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in that businesses.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the not removing of those popish officers in this state, that have places of great trust and strength committed to their fidelity, as Townes, Forts, Castles, Magazines, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neles, Captaines, Livetennants, and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of warre, which puts this Kingdome in as much danger as <hi>Ireland,</hi> if God in mercy do not defend it, giving such wisedome, and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the wise Councell of the state, that they may by degrees remove such dangerous officers, and place good Protestants in their roome, which I wish withall my heart may be done in time, for feare wee have not cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent their injoyments of such places. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Speaker, it may be obiected that many of the Popish religion are very faithfull and loyall to the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> and his Maiesty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found their fidelity preferred them, and doubtlesse all of them are not perfidious though many be refractory and willing to increase theire number in their religion, and likewise many officers in this Kingdome, that are not Papists, but professe themselves Protestants, have beene as treacherous to their King, and Countrey as recusants, yet Neverlesse they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that it is necessary Papists be removed and Protestants intrusted with their places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96704:4"/>
But Sir under favour I conceive it more then necessarily, of absolute necessity to remove such as are not inclined towards the Protestants Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for I could give you many instances, by woefull experience, of the treacherous strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems that have beene attempted against, not onely the persons of the Princes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that have beene Protestants, by Papists, and the favourers of that part, but also against the whole State, to bring it to confussion, and place themselves and their religion herein. The records of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in the raigne of our late peaceable <hi>Solomon</hi> of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry King <hi>Iames</hi> doe sufficiently testifie, whereas you finde not one to twenty Protestants have done the like besides, the present troubles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> altogether raised by the Papists, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in that Kingdom also raised by the practise of the Priests and Iesuites, I could also instance many of their treacherous designes against the persons of Peers, Noblemen, Barons, &amp; Knights, also against severall Parliaments in this kingdom, &amp; divers perticular members therof which most of this House know right-well. Therefore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Speaker I could wish there might not bee soe many suffered to inhabite this Kingdome as doe put those that are not natives might bee banished if they refuse to be conformable to the Lawes of this Land which is my humble mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96704:4"/>
And now Master Speaker haueing given you a short touch of such Impediments as haue hitherto hindered our proceedings in these Irish Affaires which is our busines for this day I shall humbly desire noe longer time may bee protracted in our determination of the Scots propositions, being as I conceive reasonable to bee agreed unto, but that wee may determine of the same, and send up to the Lords for theire Concurrence with us in the same feare our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of further time heerein may prove of such dangerous effect that wee may not have cause to repent the same and that then all our Endeavours prove of little availe towards their releife and although the Gentlman that last spake concerning other Impediments of the unseasonable repaire of tumultvous persons; is a great hinderance to us in expediting the same.</p>
            <p>Yet let them bee noe further cause of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay heerein but haveing taken order for theire suppressing wee Cheerefully proceed in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of our designes for the speedie settling of the most waightiest affaiers of this Kingdome, in Church and Common-wealth.</p>
