            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A fable <note place="margin">what is a fable.</note> is a forged tale, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining in it by the colour of a lie, a matter of truthe. The moralle is called that, out of the whiche ſome <note place="margin">Morall.</note> godlie precepte, or admonicion to vertue is giuen, to frame and inſtruct our maners. Now that we knowe what a fable is, it is good to learne alſo, how manifolde or diuers thei be, I doe finde three maner of fables to be. The firſt of theim is, <note place="margin">Three ſortes of fables.</note> wherein a man being a creature of God indued with reaſon, is onely intreated of, as the Fable of the father and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">i.

The ſecond is called a morall fable, <note place="margin">ii. Morall.</note> but I ſée no cauſe whie it is ſo called, but rather as the other is called a fable of reaſonable creatures, ſo this is contrarilie named a fable of beaſtes, or of other thinges wanting reaſon or life, wanting reaſon as of the Ante and the Greſhopper, or of this the beame caſte doun, and the Frogges choſyng their king. The thirde is a mixt Fable ſo called, bicauſe in it bothe <note place="margin">iii.

Demoſthenes the famous Oratour of Athens, vſed <note place="margin">Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vſed fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bles.</note> the fable of the Shepeherdes, and Wolues: how the Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues on a tyme, inſtauntlie required of the Shepeherdes their bande dogges, and then thei would haue peace and concorde with theim, the Shepeherdes gaue ouer their Dogges, their Dogges deliuered and murdered, the ſhepe were immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuoured: So ſaieth he, if ye ſhall ones deliuer to Philip, the king of the Macedonians your Oratours, by whoſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, knowlege and wiſedome, the whole bodie of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions is ſaued, for thei as Bandogges, doe repell all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuous enterpriſes and chaunſes, no doubte, but that raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng Wolfe Philip, will eate and conſume your people, by this Fable he made an Oracion, he altered their counſailes and heddes of the Athenians, from ſo fooliſhe an enterpriſe.

becauſe the ſhadowe would not ſuffice bothe, the Aſſe beyng ſmall, the owner ſaied, he muſte haue the ſhadowe, becauſe the Aſſe was his, I deny that ſaieth the other, the ſhadowe is myne, becauſe I hired the Aſſe, thus thei were at greate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencion, the fable beyng recited, Demoſthenes deſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his place, the whole multitude were inquiſitiue, to knowe the ende about the ſhadowe, Demoſthenes notyng their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <note place="margin">The conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion vpon the ſhadowe and the Aſſe.</note> afrended to his place, and ſaied, O ye fooliſhe Athemans, whiles I and other, gaue to you counſaill and admonicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of graue and profitable matters, your eares wer deafe, and your mindes ſlombred, but now I tell of a ſmall trifeling matter, youthrong to heare the reſte of me.

The Athenians receiued that Lawe, thei did alſo obaie his other lawes.

<pb facs="tcp:4808:65"/>
Where adulterie is cutte of, there many deteſtable vſces, and execrable purpoſes are remoued.

Although adulterie bee a deteſtable vice horrible, yea, although it be worthie death, better it were by iudgemente, and the ſentence of the Magiſtrate, the faute to bee determined: then at the will of euery manne, as a Lawe <note place="margin">Lawe.</note> by death to bee ended, the common wealthe ſhalbee in more quiet ſtate, when the horrible factes of wicked menne, by the Lawe made worthie of deathe: are neuertheleſſe by a liuelie <note place="margin">The Iudge, a liuely lawe.</note> Lawe, whiche is the Iudge, pronounced and condemned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the Lawe. Els many miſchiues might riſe in all kyngdomes and common wealthes, vnder a colour of lawe, many a honeſte perſone murthered: and many a murtherer, by cloke of a Lawe, from daunger ſaued. In Rome ſomtime a Lawe there was ordained againſte adulterie, whiche was called <hi>Lex Iulia,</hi> this Lawe Octauius Auguſtus ſet foorthe.

Then afterwarde, Lawe giuers roſe in the common wealth, that with more facilitee tolerated that vice, then wickedneſſe flowed, adulterie not puniſhed by death. And ſence that, the Romaine Empire, wrapped and ſnared
