            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe draught of a Pawne is only one houſe
at a time ſtreight forward in his owne file
never retiring; but he differs from all other
pieces, in that it doth not take the adverſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as it goeth, but that which ſtandeth aſlope in
the next houſe forward of the next file on either
hand, and then goeth forward upon occaſion as
at firſt; now as all other pieces doe, he guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
any piece of his owne ſide juſt as he taketh,
that is, if a piece of his ſide ſtandeth in that place
where if it were an adverſe piece he might take
it, he then doth guard it, ſo alſo doth he check,
that is, (give notice to) the adverſe King that he
can take him, which check if the King cannot
avoid either by taking him up himſelfe if he be
unguarded (for a King can at no time remove
into checke) or by cauſing him to be taken up
by ſome other of his pieces, it is checke Mate, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53441:14"/>
the Game loſt. This is the draught of the Pawne
who though it be of leaſt value, yet hath it thre,
great priviledges.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that whereas his remove is but
one houſe forward at a time, yet every pawne
for his firſt draught, may remove two houſes
forward.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that if any pawne commeth up
to the fourth ranke of the adverſe party, if any
of his pawnes of the next file on either ſide doe
remove two houſes at one time, that is beyond
his guard, he may take him as if he had removed
but one.</p>
               <p>The third and greateſt is, that if any Pawne
can arrive unto any houſe of the uppermoſt
ranke of the adverſary, you may immediately
make him a Queen, or what piece you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
loſt, (yea in forraigne Countries, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the beſt players, here you may have
two or three Queens at a time) who ſhall be
able at that very inſtant, to check the adverſe
King, and uſe all power the Piece you make him
hath.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Biſhops, and Knights.</head>
               <p>NEXt in value above a Pawne are Biſhops
and Knights. The Biſhops walke is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the ſame colour he is firſt placed in,
forward and backward aſlope as far as you
pleaſe, and the way is cleare betwixt him and the
place you intend to remove him to, ſo doth he
guard any piece of his own ſide; take any of the
contrary, and check the adverſe King, which
unavoided by either taking or cauſing him to be
taken up, or interpoſing ſome piece between
him and the King, it is Check mate.</p>
               <p>The Knights draught is forward and backward
on either hand aſlope from the place he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in, to the next ſave one of another colour,
skipping over any piece that ſtandeth in his
way; and in the ſame manner doth he guard,
take, and check; which check, becauſe (as the
Pawnes check) it cannot be covered, the King
muſt either remove out of check, or cauſe him
to be taken, for he cannot take him himſelfe, it
is Check mate. Now the difference of worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Biſhops and Knights is uncertaine,
ſome preferring one, ſome the other, as they
play beſt with either of them themſelves, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it in their adverſary: but generally the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53441:15"/>
Knights are more eſteemed, becauſe their walks
have more variety, that is, into all the ſixty
foure houſes, but a Biſhops walke is, but through
thirty two of them: A Knight likewiſe guardeth
three houſes before he doth remove, and eight
when he is from the ſide of the file, whereas the
Biſhop guardeth but two houſes in his firſt
place, and but foure afterward; Thirdly, the
Knights can guard one another, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
cannot doe, becauſe they move into one
anothers colour: Fourthly, a Knights check
cannot be covered, but a Biſhops may, and I
cannot ſee, but that the two Knights and a King
may give a mate though not ſo well as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
but it is hard for either of them to doe it.</p>

               <p>THe Rocks, Rookes or Dukes walk forward,
backward, and ſide-wayes in any rank and
file (but not aſlope as the Biſhops do) unto any
place; ſo alſo doe they guard, take, and check,
which check, if not avoided the game is loſt:
Now a Rookes worth is as great as both a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and a Knights, becauſe he goeth over all
the board which the Biſhop cannot, and though
the Knight may, yet his remove is confined to a
certaine diſtance, when the Rookes is unlimited
where there is no interpoſition, and although he
guards no more places then the Biſhop doth,
yet he can give mate with the King alone, which
no piece elſe beſide the Queen can doe; his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
is to change with the King as you ſhall
ſee in the Kings Prerogative.</p>
               <p>But the Queen is in value equall to any two
pieces: Her remove being forward, backward,
ſide-waye, and aſlope, but not as the Knight
doth as far as ſhe will if ſhe meet no oppoſition,
ſhe in like manner doth guard the pieces of her
owne ſide, take the enemy and check his King
which unavoided is Mate: She guardeth five
houſes in her firſt place, and eight when ſhe is
from the ſide of the file.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53441:16"/>
The King removeth but one houſe at a time
forward, backward, ſide-wayes, and aſlope to
any place not poſſeſſed by his owne men, or
guarded by the enemy where he may take any
piece of the enemies; but there muſt be alwayes
the diſtance of one houſe between the two
Kings, for they can neither check nor take one
another, he guardeth as many places as the
Queen doth. His Prerogative is</p>
               <p>Firſt, that no piece can take him, but muſt
only ſalute him with the word check.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas his draught is but one
houſe at a time, yet for his greater ſafety, if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he nor either of the Rookes have as yet
ſtirred out of their places, and there is no piece
ſtanding between them, he may change (or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)
with this Rooke, that is, he may goe two
draughts at once towards this Rooke on which
hand ſoever he ſtandeth, cauſing the Rooke to
ſtand next to him on either ſide; this may he
doe at any time before check, or after check,
In <hi>France</hi> the Rook when the King changeth,
goeth into the Kings houſe.</p>

               <p>HAving now diſcovered the places, removes,
guards, worth and Prerogative of each
piece, I will now ſhew you ſome obſervations in
the removall of them: but whereas there is 64
houſes in the Cheſſe-board, there may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
as many varieties of games as 64 can
be altered which are more then there have been
minutes ſince the Creation, therefore there is no
ſuch rule found out at this game, as who ſhall
play according to it, muſt neceſſarily win the
game: however there may be ſuch precepts and
directions given, that whoſoever ſhall carefully
obſerve and remember upon occaſion to put
them in uſe, ſhall have great advantage againſt
him that hath them not, ſo that the following
adviſes and Gambetts well ſtudied will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a rule to direct you how to advance and
retire, how to take opportunities, as alſo how
to deſigne upon your adverſary to foreſee and
prevent his ſtratagemes, with a returne upon
himſelfe: For certainly he that hath before his
eyes &amp; in his memorie many games well played
ſhall be able to make ſuch obſervations upon
them, as may ſtand him in great ſtead when ever
the enemy ſhall fall into ſuch a poſture of game
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53441:17"/>
as he hath formerly ſeen, and remembreth the
diſadvantage he is liable to.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing therefore you are to indeavour
is, to get the firſt remove, for it is of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
for which gameſters ſtrive ſeverall
wayes according to their agreement between
themſelves, but when a game is ended he is to
have it, who winneth it, unleſſe you make it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
Now for the firſt draught it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
eſteemed beſt to remove the Kings pawne
two houſes, becauſe if not prevented (by the
like play) you may ſtill move that pawne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with good guard, which will be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to the adverſary.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſervable is to play your
men in good guard of one another, that if any
man you advance be taken, the adverſe piece
may be taken againe by the piece which guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
yours: and to this purpoſe be (of all
things) ſure to have as many guards upon one
of your pieces, as thou ſeeſt the enemy doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his upon it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that thy guardes be of leſſe value
then the pieces he aſſaileth withall, for then if
either he or you begin to take you ſhall gaine
ſomething, if you finde you cannot well guard
your piece, ſee whether you can advance ſome
piece, of yours in guard to take a better piece
for ſo you may many times ſave your endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd
piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53441:17"/>
Fourthly, never change piece for piece untill
you get the advantage either by taking a Pawne
or Noble-man of his for nothing, or diſordering
a pawne or two of his which is of very materiall
conſequence.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, take great heed that you doe not choak
up your owne paſſage from advancing your
men, and retiring on all occaſions, but indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by all meanes to take that liberty from
your adverſary.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, never play any man untill you have
examined whether you your ſelfe are free from
danger, and to that end upon every remove of
your adverſary, conſider of what conſequence
the advancing and retreating of your adverſary
may prove, and indeavour (if it may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
to prevent it before it be too late.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, conſider the maine deſigne of the
game, which is as ſuddenly as can be to give
check mate, that is as I ſaid before, ſo to check
the adverſary King, as that he can neither take
the piece checking becauſe it is guarded, nor
cauſe it to be taken, nor cover the check, nor
remove out of check, which may be done ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
wayes, ſo that ſometimes by the loſſe of one
or two of your great men, yea, ſometimes of
your Queen you may give an unexpected mate,
as you may often obſerve in the following Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betts:
I ſhall therefore omit to diſcover unto
you the manner of the ſurprizing the Rookes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53441:18"/>
or a Queen, or the making a new Queen, of
which you ſhall have plentifull examples in the
Gambetts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, never let your Queen ſtand ſo before
your King, as that your adverſary may bring a
Rooke or Biſhop to check your King if ſhe were
not there, for then you will hardly be able to
ſave your Queen, nor let his Knight come ſo
ſafely, that he cannot be taken up to check your
Queen and King or your Rooke, and King at
one time, for then you will looſe your Queen or
Rooke, ſince the King muſt be forced to remove
out of check.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of ſome particular things to be obſerved, with the
lawes of Cheſſe-play.</head>
               <p>BEfore I come to the Gambetts, I will tell
you what a Forke, a ſtale, a blind Mate and
a dead Game is.</p>
               <p>A Forke is, that when you ſee two of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Noble-men ſtanding in the ſame ranke, and
but one houſe betwixt them, advance a pawne,
guarded with an other, unto the middle houſe
before them both, and you may commonly take
one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53441:18"/>
A ſtale is given when one King hath loſt all
his men, and hath but one place left to fly into,
if then the adverſary bar him of that place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
checking him, ſo that he being now out of
check cannot remove but into check, it is then a
ſtale, and he that giveth it to the diſtreſſed King
loſeth the Game.</p>
               <p>A blind Mate is, when one giveth check mate
but ſeeth it not, yet it is nevertheleſſe a Mate,
though a diſgracefull one.</p>
               <p>A dead Game is when only the two Kings
are left: yea moſt Gameſters will draw the
ſtakes, when they have but a Knight or Biſhop
left with their King, and the enemy only his
King: For it is not poſſible then to give a
Mate by force.</p>

               <head>The Lawes of Cheſſe are,</head>
               <p>1. If you touch your man you muſt play it,
and if you ſet it downe any where you muſt let it
ſtand.</p>
               <p>2. If your adverſary play a falſe draught, and
you ſpy it not before you play the next draught,
tis then too late to challenge him.</p>
               <p>3. If by miſtake you play a falſe draught, and
your adverſary let it alone for his advantage till
he hath played his next draught, you nor he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
then recall it.</p>
               <p>4. If at firſt you miſplace your men, and play
two or three draughts, it lieth in your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
choice whether you ſhall play out the game
or begin it againe.</p>
               <p>5. The King in changing may not goe into
check, nor at any time remove into check.</p>
               <p>6. If your adverſary playeth or diſcovereth a
check to your King, and giveth you no notice
of it, you may let him ſtand ſo for that draught
if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>7. If your King ſtandeth in check and you
remove a draught or two, the adverſary may
not give check when he pleaſeth, unleſſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth
the piece checking, or ſome other.</p>
