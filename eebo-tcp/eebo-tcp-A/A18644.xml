            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fession is not: there wanteth also the cause of confession, whiche is true faith. For as the tre is knowen bi hir fruites: so is faith bi hir effec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, is a token that the faith is dead, the ende of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable tre is cutting down, and
<pb facs="tcp:7697:3"/>
casting into the fyre. The ende of the fruitles faith is death, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting to eternal damnation. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Peter requiteth vs,<note place="margin">Pe. iii</note> to make answer to euery man, that deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of vs, of such hope as is in vs, with gentlenes &amp; reuerence, which is a very testimony that we sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy god in our hartes, as it is before in the same chap. For the greatest honour that man can geue to god: is to confesse and answer in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of trouble, truly and faithfully to his holy word and faith. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the dutie of euery christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to prai &amp; studie to haue a thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh knoledge of his faith in Christ and that as the glory of god shall require, and his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> attempt: to be redy to make answer for the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me. whatsoeuer the world feare, displeasure, frendshippe, or other lettes should saie to the contrary: vpon paine saith Christ, that i will denie him before mi father,<note place="margin">Mark viii Luke. ix·xii.</note> which is in heauen. But how hard a thing it is to confesse Christ in the daies of trouble, not onely the Scripture but also daily experience in good

men &amp; women doth declare. True confession is enuironed on euerye side with mani daungers on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght hand &amp; on the left hand, nowe with faire meanes, then with foul thretni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, fearful &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous as it is said by Christ, thei shal betraye you to the iudges, and of theim ye shalbe beaten &amp; iudged to death.

The wysdome of the world doth say: although i do accomplish the desire of my frindes, and to the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of the world, am prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the masse, and with my body do as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men do: or as i mai do, yet my heart is clene contrary to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe,

and I do detest such idolatry, and beleue that the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that i am present at, is mere idolatri and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination.

Now marke of this place. If it bee so horrible and damnable a thinge to be false in the hert, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch none knoeth but God, &amp; is wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thi also of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what is to be iudged of the outward &amp; manifest vse of idolatry? whiche not onely God, but also eueri good man kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth and abhorreth. Ther is no cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lered nor clooked hipocrisie that god can awaie with. If the hearte thinke not as the tonge speaketh, or elce the tonge speke otherwise then the heart thinketh, bothe be abhominable beefore god. Reade the .iii. and .vi. cha. of the first Epi of s.

When ye sinne so aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst the brethren, and wound their weake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, ye sinne against Christ. This iudgement of s. Paull is more to be folowed, then al our owne fained and wrested defences that woulde seme to do wel, when we halt on both sides, which god abhorreth. Paull hath a profound and a deepe consideration of that mans fact, that hath knoledge, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perceiueth his dissimulation to be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerus &amp; perilous to all ꝑso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that he dwelleth withal First al such as be of a right &amp; staied iudgement, &amp; will not prostrate their bodyes to an idol, doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by their such dissimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the very idolaters them selues haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and defence of their abhomination, by the ptesence of him, that the Christen congregati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, knoeth to haue knolege. Third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, the weake sort, that wold glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the best waye, by a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers halting and plaieng on both handes: embraceth both in bodye

and in soule the euil that he abhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth in his heart, that hath know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; yet with presence hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it as other dooe, that haue no knoledge. If S. Paul said, that the weke brother doth perish for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ died, i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that abused kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge in meates and drinkes, that of themselues be indifferent, how much more in the knoledge of him that vseth manifest idolatry, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden of god, as a thing not indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fferent? Take hede therfore what s. Paul meaneth, &amp; what he wolde proue against this manne that had knoledge, that nether the idol nor the meates dedicated to Idolles were anye thinge. Forsoth this he wold proue, that a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wanted knoledge, by the example of him that hath knoledge, dothe aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture to do euil, which he wold not do, in case he saw not those of whom he hath good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> go be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore him as author of the euil. And in dede when the ignorant people or those that be halfe perswaded in a truth, yea or else throwly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, what is euil, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei

haue anye notable men or wemen for an example to followe. Thei thinke in following of theim, thei be excused: yea although perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture thei do it against their con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science, as ye may se by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Peter,<note place="margin">Gala. ii.</note> how mani good men began to dissemble: yea, Barnabas himselfe Thapostle of the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. But howe great offence this is before God, so to make a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and relucting conscience to do any thing that is not godly: let the iudgement of men passe, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it by gods word. Christ saith: it were better a milstone were han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged about such an offenders neck,<note place="margin">mat. xviii</note> and caste into the sea. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, the pain must be the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause we geue offence wittinglie against our owne consciences, and this before God, is a wicked kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that causeth another to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. wo be to him that is learned, to bring his brother to destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Doth a christian manne know the truth to bring his brother to a lye? for those weaklinges that we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to stumble, Christ died for, as S.

Paule saith: God defende that we should confirme any mans consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in euil. Let euery man of God weie with himselfe the Doctrine of s. Paule, that commaundeth vs to flie from idolatrye. And marke what s. Paule in that place calleth idolatry. It is to bee sene plainly, that he speaketh not of such ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latri, as men that lack knoledge in their hearts what God is, &amp; what is not god. For in the .viii. chap. be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, he saithe that menne knowe that the idols wer no gods, &amp; that althoughe by name the Gentyles had mani gods: yet thei knew ther was but one God. Therfor he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aneth nothinge by this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, flie idolatry, but to auoyd such rites, ceremonies &amp; vsages as outwardly were vsed in the honor &amp; reuerence of the idols, that wer not god. And weiing the right vse of the Lordes Supper, and the dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie therof, with the maner &amp; vse of the gentiles toward their gods: would bring the church of the Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rinthians to vnderstand, how that as the deuine and sacred rites, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb facs="tcp:7697:7"/>
and vse of the blessed sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament of Christes body &amp; bloud did sacrate, sanctify and declare him that vseth it, to be the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and childe of god: so did the rites and sacramentes of the Gentiles define and declare the vses ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of to be the seruauntes &amp; children of the idolles, notwithstandinge in their hert, thei knew wel inough the idoll was nothing. God bi his sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes doth couple vs to him selfe. Let vs praye to him that we pollute not our selues, with any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ceremonies or vsages, not insti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuted by god. In this case a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man to be at the Masse, is to be considered with what mind those that there he accompanieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self withal, commeth thither, and what the ende is of the work that the priest doth. The people come to honour the bread and wyne for god, and the prist purposeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secrate both god and man, and so to offer Christ to the father for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne. Nowe doe those that adioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto these people, professe and declare a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sietie
<pb facs="tcp:7697:7"/>
and felowship of the same impietie, as s. Paul laid to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians charge. S. Paull was not offended with the Corinthians be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause thei lacked knoledge of the true God:<note place="margin">ii. Cor. vi</note> but because contrary to their knoledge, thei associated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues with idolatores. For this is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in all rites, sacramentes, and honoringes, whether thei be of God or of the Deuill, there is a profession of the communion: so that anye man protesteth to be of the same religion that the rest bee of that be partakers with him. I do knowe there bee manye inuasions made by men, that teach a manne with safegard of his conscience to be at Masse, but forasmuch as Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ster Caluin, Master Bullenger and others, haue throughly answe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red theim, suche as bee in doubt, may rede their bookes.</p>
            <p>This is a true confession, and consonant to goddes holy worde.</p>
