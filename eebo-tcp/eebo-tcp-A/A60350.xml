            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:64521:2"/>
Not long since Providence frowned upon us, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to threaten the laying of our Vineyard waste, by taking away the principle Stake in its Hedge; had the Foxes and wilde Boars then broken in and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, it had been just: But in rich mercy the Lord hath again made up the gap, and raised up another to stand in the breach. What duty you, and all owe unto him, the following Discourse tells you, which was calculated for no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther Meridian than yours, prepared onely for your Table, intended onely for your Direction and Instruction. The truth is, I judge not my self sufficiently accomplished to walk abroad, if my plain dress will please you my Friends and Neighbors at home, it is as much as I can promise my self; and I can say to Gods glory, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served commendation, that hitherto you have given very friendly entertainment to my poor labors, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learned to rellish plain Truth, and to make mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h of the simplicity of the Gospel, though it be not adorned and guarnish't with the gaudy and flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words of mans wisdom. Indeed your Town is not exempted from the common condition of all great places; there are divisions among you, under which let you and me groan. We have many enemies to the Churches purity, and we have some that are but small friends to the Churches peace; some that would defile her with their sinful mixtures, others that scratch her face, and fetch blood, with their causeless separations; But blessed be God, that you have learned to follow peace and holiness, and to judge, that these two are not inconsistent. As for those who are godly, but differ from you herein (of what perswasion soever they be) I shall pray for
<pb facs="tcp:64521:3"/>
them, long after them, and wish that they were like-minded with you, and shall wait till God shall reveal this unto them.</p>
            <p>But since there are Divisions among us, it would be a wonder if I should not meet with some opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or not taste of that bitter cup, which my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers and Brethren have ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> so large draughts of, nay, which my dearest Lord and Master drank deeper of than any, though he spake as never man spake. I thought the ensuing Sermon had been so harmless and inoffensive, as that it might have past without a censure: It was not my design (neither when I studied, nor when I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it) to exasperate the spirits of any, my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to kindle praying affections in all, not to inflame the choler of any one; and I hope, those that peruse it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will think it hath a Dove-like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and brings in its mouth an Olive-branch of peace. But he that doth not like the Cook, will finde some fault with the Provision; if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be not acceptable, his Sermons will be unsavory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will not say, that for this Sermon I have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>A Sowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the spirits of some. But if this is to be vile, I will (God enabling me) be yet more vile. Not that I would call for fire from Heaven upon every one that is of a perswasion different from mine, neither is my charity so strait-laced, as to have a bosom open to none, but those that jump in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with me. I know Christ prayed that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be one, as the Father and he are one; and
<pb facs="tcp:64521:3"/>
that prayer shall be answered, because God heard him always; but I am apt to think that a compleat oneness and perfect harmony will not be the happiness of the way, but of the Countrey. I verily believe there shall be a sweeter close among Christians here, and that there shall be fewer differences than now, if any at all, and happy are they that live to see it; in the mean while I condemn not every one that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth from me, nor dare I say all are out of the way that do not exactly tread in my steps. Question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we must bear one with another, allowance ought to be given in matters controverted und of less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But what then, because flowers of several colours, and different sizes ought to be continued and lookt to, must weeds be suffered in the Garden? Because we may, without breach of charity, differ about Circumstantials, shall there be no hedge set about the Fundamentals? Christians, can you think it is pleasing to God, that the Holy Trinity should be spoken against, your Blessed Savior degraded, your Publique Assemblies forsaken, your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters made Antichristian? I beseech you, consult the Word, and your own Consciences, and then tell me whether that would not be an accursed Toleration, which should suffer these and such like things. What would become of Religion if that should be granted? Surely the weeds, if let alone, will in time, choak the Corn. They need not be watered, it is enough for them, if they be let alone: If I desire they may be rooted out, I hope I am no enemy to Church and State, neither to God nor Caesar, and yet for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I am maligned, and have been evil spoken of once and again. So that being necessitated to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb facs="tcp:64521:4"/>
my self, and hoping these poor Labors may not be altogether useless, I have been willing (contrary to mine own Genius) to send them forth into the world, the blessing of God go with them. Something I have added, I hope that will not offend, since no thing is diminished; you have one or two passages twice ever, because I thought it a piece of honesty (pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing my Notes u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for you, mine honored Friends, I have onely to tell you, that I love you in the Lord, desire your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, pray for, and shall rejoyce in the prosperity of your souls.

Go on (as you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun) to own God, his Cause, and Ministers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you have already attained, walk by the same rule, and minde the same thing. Mark them which cause divisions, and avoid them, keep up an high esteem of publique Ordinances, and be constant in your attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them; contend earnestly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints. Hold fast that which you have, and let no man take your Crown. Be humble and fruitful, study not to be wise above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; credit the means you enjoy by your spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases, and exemplary conversations. And that God would bless you with grace, peace and comfort here, and crown you with glory hereafter, is, and shall be the prayer of</p>

They made it their care to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son him with Gospel-Truths, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with that way in which he ought to walk; and their pains herein were so successful, as that <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth this of <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>That he knew the Holy Scriptures from a childe.</hi> Being thus in his childhood instructed by his parents, he was in his youth entertained by <hi>Paul,</hi> who took much pains with him, and built upon that foundation which was before laid. At last being duly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64521:5"/>
qualified for, he was admitted unto the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Evangelist, which was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and not much inferior unto that of an Apostle. He supplied <hi>Pauls</hi> absence in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Churches which were newly planted by him, which trust he discharged with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fidelity, thereby fully answering that confidence which <hi>Paul</hi> had of him. Among other places, he was left at <hi>Ephesus</hi> (<hi>Paul</hi> going from thence into <hi>Macedonia</hi>) to make an end of ordering and setting the affairs of that Church, which was already planted there: And whilest he was thus executing his charge, the Apostle sends this Epistle to him, which contains in it wholesom Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and strengthning or comfortable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. In the beginning thereof, he chargeth him to lay a restraint upon those who were over-busie in spreading of Doctrines, either contrary to, or diverse from that which <hi>Paul</hi> had already preached among them; and effectually to endeavor the rooting out of that false Doctrine, those Tares of Error which Satan had by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments sowen among them; and so to maintain the Truth delivered, in its purity, the Church erected, in its beauty. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Epistle, he toucheth upon sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry points, some of <hi>universal concernment,</hi> respecting all men, some having a more <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> and limited respect unto persons in such or such places and capacities. Thus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64521:5"/>
he treats of the duty of women, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns them, modesty in apparel, silence in the Churches: He shews what qualities are required in Bishops and Deacons, who are Ecclesiastical Officers: And as our Saviour would have <hi>Cesar</hi> have what was his due, so his servant the Apostle, treading in his Masters steps, teacheth <hi>Timothy,</hi> and by him the Church at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and not onely them, but all that owe part of that debt and duty, which we owe unto them, is Prayer for them; the payment whereof he requires of all men in the Text. <hi>I exhort, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be made for Kings, and for all that are in authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Exhortation (as <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> some conceive) was ordered out, because in those days there were some <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iude</hi> 8.</note> who bare no good will to Magistracy, but nourished this erroneous opinion, That all civil Order was profane, and contrary to the freedom of the Gospel; and that Kings and Princes were <hi>(quâ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les)</hi> enemies to God and Religion, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Gospel, and hinderances of that liberty which was purchased by Christ; as if our Redeemer did not do enough for us, in breaking the powers of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and in pulling down the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from his seat, and in bringing a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual liberty from the law of sin and death over unto his people, unless he also over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the thrones of worldly Princes, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

their Scepters out of their hands, and pluckt up by the roots the hedge of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws. A Principle which did not die with those of that age, or if dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with them, it was afterwards raised out of the grave by the Anabaptists, and it is at this day made much of, and kept warm in the bosom of those whom we call, <hi>The Fifth-monarchy-men</hi>; who, I believe, are not yet such desperate enemies to Power and Authority, but that they would wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Scepter and Sword, if put into their own hands, since they plead for the Saints governing the world, wisely making themselves of the number. Our blessed Apostle, in order to the correcting of this foolish and erroneous conceit, calls upon <hi>Timothy</hi> and all others, to pray for those that have the Sword of Magistracy and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in their hands; thereby teaching us, that we should be so far from decrying them, opposing them, or rising up against them, that we should by prayer beg Gods assisting them in the administration of that Trust which is committed to them.</p>
            <p>In the words you may take notice of these Parts. First, a Duty exhorted unto, <hi>That Prayers, Supplications, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks be made.</hi> Secondly, the persons for whom Supplications, &amp;c are to be made; and they are, First, <hi>All men.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Kings, and all that are in authority.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64521:6"/>
Thirdly, that which we are to pray for, <hi>That under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not spend time now in opening the words, and shewing you what lieth in the womb of each phrase in them, since that will be done, in the handling of the Doctrine which I shall draw from them, that is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayers are to be made for Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> 
               <hi>for all that are invested with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and raised up to eminent place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Princes have their hands upon the Rudder, subjects should have their eyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven; while they are consulting and caring for us, we should be praying and wrestling for them. <hi>They are not too great,</hi> but that a weak Christian may, and should carry them in his armes to the Throne of Grace: outward <hi>advantages</hi> do not raise them above our <hi>prayers.</hi> Indeed those that sit upon <hi>Christs throne in heaven,</hi> and are crowned with the glory above, have no need either to pray themselves, or that any else should pray for them; but they that sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>earthly thrones,</hi> and are clothed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty here, will see cause, not onely to ask for themselves, but to send others also to the Throne of Grace, that they may speak a good word, and beg for them. <hi>Nor are they too good for us to</hi> pray for. <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, eminent for pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and holiness, yet should the Church bless him in his exploits. If a Prince be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he will be sure to meet with most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations from Satan, most oppositions from wicked men, and therefore should be most strongly guarded. Though there be a good <hi>Ioshua</hi> fighting in the valley, yet the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekires may prevail, if the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> in the mount be not kept up. The godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Magistrate doth encourage us to pray for him, since we go to God on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his friend and servant, but it doth not give us a Writ of Ease, nor exempt us from our duty. <hi>Nor are any of them too wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> for us to pray for them. <hi>Nero</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epistle, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out this exhortation, he was an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown sinner, a monster, a beast rather then a man, a desperate enemy to Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all its professors, yet pray for him, saith <hi>Paul. Good Princes</hi> cannot be <hi>without</hi> prayers, <hi>wicked Princes</hi> stand most <hi>in need</hi> of them: <hi>pray</hi> for those that are <hi>bad,</hi> that God would make them <hi>better</hi>; for <hi>those</hi> that they might <hi>never back-slide</hi> from God, for <hi>these</hi> that they might return unto that God from whom they have <hi>already back-slidden.</hi> Our charity ought to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, and by our prayers we should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare both of <hi>friends and foes,</hi> as our Lord and Master gave us command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Love your enemies, bless them that

Truly, when <hi>that</hi> is done, all is not done, the greatest part of the work is yet behinde; it becomes <hi>Christians</hi> by prayer to raise up the <hi>posse Coeli,</hi> the Powers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to call in the everlasting arms; <hi>Exurgat Deus,</hi> Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered. But we procced. Therefore;</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> We must put up <hi>gratulatory</hi> prayers for Princes and such as are in authority over us. <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is a part of prayer, and it is the fourth thing called for here in the <hi>Text.</hi> The word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth (<hi>gratiarum actionem pro ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptis beneficiis</hi>) a giving of thanks for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits <hi>received,</hi> which is a duty incumbent upon every <hi>Christian,</hi> in every <hi>condition,</hi> for every <hi>mercy</hi>; for there is no condition in which a Christian can be, but therein he findes mercy, if not <hi>comforting</hi> mercy, yet <hi>supporting</hi> mercy; if not <hi>delivering,</hi> yet <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating</hi> mercy; if not so <hi>much</hi> mercy as he <hi>desires,</hi> yet <hi>more</hi> then he <hi>deserves,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mercy ought to be thankfully entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God cannot be required <hi>for,</hi> yet he must be owned and acknowledged <hi>in</hi> the out-goings of his goodness. We can, for all the favours we receive from God, pay him <hi>no other</hi> way, and therefore here we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64521:12"/>
should be <hi>liberal</hi>; God doth not call for thousands of <hi>rams,</hi> nor for ten thousands of <hi>rivers of oyl,</hi> surely then none should grudge him the <hi>calves</hi> of the lips. Now as this lieth as a duty upon every Christian thankfully to own Gods goodness in that <hi>dew</hi> which falls upon his own <hi>fleece,</hi> in those blessings which are reached out to him, or his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or relations in particular, so is it their duty to bless God for that <hi>dew</hi> which falls upon the <hi>ground round about,</hi> yea, though their own <hi>fleece</hi> be dry, and Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out a more sparing hand to them, as to their own private interest. And so to come to the business in hand.</p>
            <p>When the Rulers of a Nation have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God signal and eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, all under them should take their part, and joyn with them in a Song of Praise: Thus did the Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 20.5. <hi>We will rejoyce in thy salvation, in the Name of our God we will set up our banners, the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.</hi> Thy deliverances, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and victories shall be our joy, thy prosperous <hi>successes</hi> shall be seconded with our <hi>triumphs,</hi> we will lift up our banners. <hi>Ingrediemur urbem erectis vexillis,</hi> we will enter the City with Trumpets sounding, Drums beating, Colours flying, as after an happy and glorious Conquest. Thus the mercies, and blessings, and deliverances which are vouchsafed unto them, should be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64521:13"/>
set upon our score, and we for them should acknowledge our selves Gods debters, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>interest</hi> of praise, as if the <hi>principal</hi> had been in our own hands. <hi>This is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceptable to God:</hi> that Sacrifice savours best, unto which every one contributes something, then do we make the sweetest melody in the ears of heaven, when all joyn together. <hi>And it is exceeding rational in it self,</hi> reason requires that we should thankfully acknowledge those Mercies which we taste the sweetness and reap the benefit of. Mercies to the Rulers of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are <hi>National</hi> mercies, they have not a private, but publick influence. The clouds indeed may empty themselves more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon them, but yet some of their <hi>drops</hi> distil and fall upon the smallest and meanest <hi>spot</hi> of the Land. It is true, the <hi>Oyl</hi> of divine Goodness may be most liberally shed upon the <hi>head</hi> of a Nation, but it doth not stay there, no, it descends to the very <hi>skirts</hi> of the garments. The same providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dispensation which blesseth <hi>them</hi> with <hi>prosperity,</hi> doth reach out unto <hi>us peace</hi>: that Mercy which gives our Princes to set their <hi>feet</hi> upon the <hi>necks</hi> of their enemies, keeps those <hi>enemies</hi> from setting their <hi>feet</hi> upon <hi>our necks.</hi> It is true, the Cup is put into their hands, and they have the most hearty draughts, but since every one of us <hi>sips</hi> of it, let us <hi>look up.</hi> Of this more hereafter.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64521:13"/>
So much may suffice to be spoken of the first thing. <hi>What kinde of prayers</hi> must be put up for Princes, and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and Thanksgivings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second thing which we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, is this: <hi>What is to be the matter of our prayers?</hi> or, what ought we to beg of God for them? Some things by way of direction have been <hi>scattered</hi> already up and down in this Discourse, which for your help, you may <hi>gather</hi> together and <hi>bundle</hi> up; But we shall not so content our selves, therefore in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, we should pray that God would pour out upon them a <hi>spirit of Government.</hi> When <hi>Samuel</hi> had anointed <hi>Saul,</hi> it is said, <hi>God gave him another heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.9. that other heart was not a sanctified heart, not a renewed heart, not an heart furnished with the saving graces of Gods spirit; for notwithstanding all his professions, and good conversations, he was a wicked profane wretch, he carried a foul heart under a fair face. But God gave him an heart <hi>fit for rule,</hi> an heart endowed with <hi>Heroick</hi> vertues and <hi>Princely</hi> qualities. Such an heart we should beg for the Chief Governor of the Nation, that as he hath <hi>high imployment,</hi> so he may have a raised and <hi>noble spirit:</hi> He that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns a <hi>State,</hi> had need of another kinde of heart then he that drives a <hi>plow</hi>: pray for him that God would give him <hi>grace.</hi> He
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64521:14"/>
ought to be religious himself, who would promote it in his subjects. He is not like to destroy all the wicked of the Land, who doth not himself walk within his house with a perfect heart. I do not think that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is founded in grace; and an irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Prince ought to be dethroned. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Saul</hi> was a <hi>lawful king,</hi> though no <hi>holy man,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> a <hi>true</hi> Apostle, although <hi>false</hi> to his Master. He that hath not <hi>grace</hi> in his heart, may yet hold a <hi>Scepter</hi> in his hand; but doubtless Holiness is the most sparkling <hi>jewel</hi> in the Princes <hi>Crown</hi>: and he is like to rule best, who hath the law of God in his heart. Pray, that God would give him <hi>directions</hi> from above, hold his hand, steer his course, make his way plain before his face, so guide him with his counsel, as that this rule might be managed according to Gods will, and all things ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prescript of the Word. Thus in <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.1. <hi>Give the King thy judgements, O God, and thy righteousness unto the Kings son.</hi>
               <q>By judgement and righteousness (saith <hi>Mollerus</hi> upon the place) both here, and many other places of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> you must understand such a rectitude &amp; strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in which there is no swerving from honesty and equity, no giving way to lust or passion, no tyrannical actings; but an approving and encouraging of that which is good, a condemning and punishing that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64521:14"/>
which is evil. And so <hi>David</hi> prays here for <hi>Solomon,</hi> that God would teach <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> his duty, what he owes to his subjects, and how he ought to administer the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that so his Government might be no other then a copying out of Gods Judgements and Righteousness, that as God doth most wisely, holily, and justly govern the whole world, so <hi>Solomon</hi> might that part of it which was committed unto his charge.</q>
The same should we pray for our Princes and Governors, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for him whom God hath now set over us: So much in general. But let us return again to the Text, which is not onely a precept, but the <hi>praying mans directory,</hi> and here <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, we should pray for those that are in authority, that <hi>under them we might lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty</hi>; So that we should pray, that their Government may be wisely directed to the attaining of these three ends; <hi>Peace, Piety, Honesty.</hi> Of all which in their order.</p>
            <p>We should pray that under them we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> might lead <hi>a peaceable life. Pacem te posci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnes</hi>: there is such incomparable and taking beauty in Peace, as there be few or none but are enamored with it: it needs no Encomiums, carrying its <hi>commendation</hi> in its very <hi>name.</hi> And since all desire it, it becomes all to pray for it: follow it with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64521:15"/>
endeavors and prayers, and that is the way to get it, they that would <hi>have</hi> it on <hi>earth,</hi> must <hi>seek</hi> it in <hi>heaven,</hi> at the hands of that God, who is the <hi>Prince</hi> of Peace, who can <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> it, yea if need be <hi>create</hi> it. We live like Heathens if we do not often go to the Throne of Grace, in those addresses among other Petitions we ought to make some for peace, that God would grant us to sit under our own vines and fig-trees, none making us afraid. Thus they prayed for Jerusalem, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122.6, 7. <hi>Pray for the peace of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, they shall prosper that love thee; peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.</hi> Prosperity is the daughter of Peace, sucks her breast, and hath all its nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from her. If <hi>Peace</hi> the mother <hi>dieth,</hi> Prosperity the daughter will <hi>follow</hi> her, and both shall be intombed together: if the <hi>neck</hi> of Peace be cut asunder, the <hi>head</hi> of Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity falls to the ground. The Israelites were by the express commandment of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to pray for the peace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the place whither they were carried captive, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.7. <hi>Seek the peace of the City, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have caused you to be carried captives, and pray unto the Lord for it, for in the peace thereof, shall ye have peace</hi>: and if they were to pray for <hi>Babylon,</hi> shall not we pray for <hi>Zion?</hi> if they were commanded to pray for the peace of the Land of their <hi>Captivity,</hi> how much more should we pray for the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64521:15"/>
peace of the Land of our <hi>Nativity.</hi> Pray that we might lead a quiet and peaceable life. <hi>A quiet life,</hi> from in-bred commotions and domestick jars: <hi>a peaceable life,</hi> free from forrein invasions. Our former suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under civil discords are (as one would think) sufficient motives to the practise of this duty: the late flames have devoured much, and we are all as brands pluckt out of the burning, let us be earnest with God that another fire may not be kindled among us. Surely they that do (as we do) know what war means, how dreadful sounds in our ears the roarings of the Canon, the sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the prisoners, the groans of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the complaints and sobs of widows and orphans have been, what it is to lie open to the incursions of a bloody and enraged ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: in a word, what it is to live in fear, of having near and dear relations broken in pieces, of being stript of all our comfortable enjoyments, of being turned out of house and home, of being deprived of liberty, yea, life it self; surely they, that know these things, will look upon Peace as a Mercy worth the praying for; Blessed be God the fire is at present quenched, the storm is laid, and we enjoy a sweet serenity, an happy calm. Indeed our <hi>peace</hi> is little less then a <hi>miracle</hi>: who is there that seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the state of affairs, the many <hi>enemies</hi> which we have abroad, the desperate <hi>heart-burnings
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64521:16"/>
and animosities</hi> which are among our selves, that doth not stand and wonder that <hi>England</hi> is in quiet as it is at this day, through the goodness of our God? Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let us <hi>admire and be thankful</hi> that we have peace; let us <hi>pray and be humble,</hi> that this peace may be continued. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know that there are those among us who would have it otherwise; <hi>vipers</hi> that would eat through their <hi>mothers bowels,</hi> so they might but make a <hi>way</hi> to their own <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</hi> Are there not some who have said, They would be glad to see all in <hi>confusion,</hi> and things will never be well till it comes to that; thereupon rejoycing when Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors divide, and differences among them heighten. There are <hi>Salamanders</hi> which love to live in the fire of Commotions and Dissentions; some that think it best fishing in the <hi>troubled</hi> disturbed waters of a <hi>shatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> State; and I wish such were not to be found among us: but observe, who are they, most of them such as having nothing to loose, care not who <hi>fall,</hi> since they know they themselves can be no <hi>lower</hi>; nay hope that their neighbors <hi>ruine</hi> will be their own <hi>raising</hi>; being so low already, they would get a little <hi>higher,</hi> by making us their <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool.</hi> Others of them, yea all the rest, or if not all (for I would not be uncharitable) yet most are men of <hi>no conscience,</hi> no piety, no friends to the power of godliness, but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64521:16"/>
would <hi>prostitute</hi> Religion, Gospel, Liberty, the Nations peace and prosperity to their <hi>own wills.</hi> I am perswaded all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, all wise men desire to sit down in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and to sayl upon a smooth sea, and can cordially say with <hi>David, We are for peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We should pray that under those who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are in authority, we may lead <hi>a godly life.</hi> It is an happy Nation, whose Rulers are not onely <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> the Fathers of the Countrey, but also <hi>Nutritii Ecclesiae,</hi> the Nursing Fathers of the Church. <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> was the most glorious part of our <hi>English Kings Title.</hi> That people have double cause of thankfulness, whose Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates care is to preserve the <hi>peace of the Nation,</hi> but chiefly to secure the <hi>purity of Religion.</hi> We read of such Governours in <hi>Israel,</hi> they had a <hi>Moses</hi> who fed them with the Law of God, the food of life, which is sweeter then the honey or the honey-comb; a <hi>David</hi> who would not give sleep to his eyes,<note place="margin">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64521:18"/>
sound Doctrine; and not bear the sword in vain, suffering it to rust in the scabberd of sloth and negligence, but draw it and use it in the defence of Truth and Piety. We had need be earnest with God to this purpose, and pray hard for, believe it, <hi>Religion lies bleeding and gasping</hi>; I think I may safely say, it was never opposed more, never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more in this Nation for this hundred years, then it doth now: how is the Land overspread with false doctrines, and with vicious practises? Never more <hi>Hereticks</hi> crying down the Truths of the Scripture then now. Never more <hi>sons of Belial</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and making a mock at the power of Godliness, and strictness of Conversation then now. And truly these two usually go hand in hand, and seldom or never are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>error</hi> in judgement leads to <hi>profaneness in life</hi>; when men have once put out the light of Truth, and debauched their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it is no wonder to see them falling into and wallowing in the mire of all wickednes. Now then in order to the suppressing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness, there must be a suppression of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and in order to the suppression of error, we ought to pray that our Magistrates would take care of two things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the fewel which feeds Error might be taken away; if you would put out the fire, withdraw the wood. The Press is <hi>glutted,</hi> and <hi>stomach sick,</hi> and <hi>spues</hi> out of its
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64521:18"/>
mouth books and pamphlets, stuft with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous doctrines, and damnable heresies, and it is sad to see how greedily poor ignorant and seduced souls <hi>lick up the vomit.</hi> There is base <hi>Copper</hi> Coyn minted, with the <hi>stamp</hi> of Truth upon it, and by it thousands of souls are <hi>cheated</hi> to their everlasting undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It would be happy for <hi>England</hi> if this abuse were rectified; for as reverend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Perkins</hi> saith,
<q>It cannot but be a great hinderance to the true Religion, that such books may be publickly sold to any one that will buy them, without due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had whether the party have gifts to discern between truth and falshood. In the Popish Church (saith he) they are more careful, for they permit not a man to read an Hereticks Book (as they call us Protestants) without leave, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great penalty.</q>
Again pray,</p>
            <p>Secondly, that a <hi>cursed and abominable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may not be granted. Many men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure that a tittle should be spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a toleration, it is their <hi>darling,</hi> and the <hi>winde</hi> must not blow upon it, under the beautiful pretext of <hi>Christian liberty.</hi> Many plead for a <hi>lawless licentiousness</hi> of preaching, printing, professing what every one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. Surely these men will not allow the same liberty in other things, would they have men do what they list, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul? so that any should come, and

blemish their Reputations, rifle their Houses, seize on their Goods, take away all their Estates, and none say, why do you so? if they will not allow this, and yet plead for a toleration of every thing, though never so contrary to Religion, I shall take leave to tell them, be they who they will, that they love their <hi>belly</hi> better than their <hi>God</hi>; and prefer their own <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> interest before the interest of <hi>Christ.</hi> The same holy Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith,
<q>It is not lawful to grant any man or people the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their own conscience in matters of Religion, permitting them to profess what Religion they will; for if this be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, how should false prophets be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</q>
The Governors of a Nation should in this imitate the good King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who assembled all <hi>Iudah,</hi> and caused all his people to hear the word of the Lord, and to stand to that Religion, which by the Book of God was made known unto them, as you may see in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.30, 31, 32 <hi>verses,</hi> The King went up into the House of the Lord, and all the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the Priests and the Levites, and all the people great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant that was found in the House of the Lord.

Lord, and to keep his Commandments, and his Testimonies, and his Statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the Covenant which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this Book, and he <hi>caused</hi> all that were present in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> to <hi>stand</hi> to it: he did not leave them to themselves, to back-slide and apostatize from God if they would, but he <hi>caused</hi> them to <hi>stand</hi> to it, and it is said <hi>verse</hi> 33.

            <p>We should pray for those that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that under them we might lead an honest life.

               </gap>, in honesty. What is that? <hi>Chamier</hi> saith the word signifieth <hi>(castita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, severitatem, gravitatem, morum hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem, &amp;c.)</hi> a kinde of severity, chastity, honesty of maners, gravity, modesty, such as is to be found in well educated youths and virgins. <hi>Aretius</hi> saith it signifieth (<hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliae decorum, &amp; gravitatem in vestitu, in cessu, sermone, factis, totaque vita</hi>) a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and order in the family, decency and gravity in habit, behaviour, words, actions, and in the whole course and conversation.

So that we ought to pray, that Magistrates may set themselves to suppress all abuses and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies whatsoever, not onely that which is contrary to godliness and piety, but also which bids defiance to morality; that they may look to the keeping of the <hi>second,</hi> as well as of the first <hi>Table</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64521:20"/>
which is to lay down some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why we ought to pray for Kings and all that are in authority. And all that I shall say, will be reduced unto these three things. <hi>Gods will. Our duty. Their necessity</hi> calls for this at our hands. God would have it, we owe it to them, they need it. Of all which as they lie before us.</p>
            <p>First, It is Gods will that we should pray <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for those that are in Authority over us. If this be but cleared up, we need do no more. This is, and ought to be <hi>argument</hi> enough with a <hi>gracious</hi> soul, who ever calls God Lord, must do what ever he commands him. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> said <hi>Paul.</hi> He did not question or deny the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which God would have. He that hath Gods Law written in his heart, will, nay cannot but delight to do Gods will: if the <hi>way</hi> be shewn, he hath <hi>feet</hi> to run it. Now it is the will of God that we should pray for our Rulers. <hi>He requires this of us.</hi> There is Gods <hi>preceptive</hi> will, and there is his <hi>permissive</hi> will. By his <hi>permissive will</hi> many things come to pass which are against his <hi>preceptive will.</hi> God forbids all sin, even the least, and yet there could be none in the world, unless he did permit it. Now a <hi>bare permission</hi> is not sufficient to warrant an <hi>action</hi>: but God doth not onely permit, but also <hi>requires,</hi> that we should pray for our Magistrates. We have leave to do it, we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64521:21"/>
may if we will, nay it is expected and lookt for; it is work that is cut out for us, and unless it be done, we can never look our Master in the face with boldness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. This is clear from the Text, <hi>I exhort that prayers be made for all men, for Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I invite or call you to it. I beg it earnestly of you. The word imports not a <hi>bare or naked</hi> wishing and advising of a thing, but a <hi>vehement</hi> intreating, an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great fervency, and many beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as some <hi>Cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icks</hi> observe. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts them to this duty, and you must consider that herein he acts as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> as Christs <hi>Messenger</hi> and <hi>Embassador,</hi> as one <hi>appointed</hi> by God to make his will known unto his people, so that God doth by him exhort us to do it: This voice of <hi>Paul</hi> is as much as if there had been a voice from <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and we are as much bound to obey this call, as if there had been an Angel sent on purpose to bring this message to us. <hi>He that heareth you,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>heareth me, and he that heareth me, heareth him that sent me.</hi> Again, as God requires this of us, <hi>so he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it in us,</hi> verse 3. <hi>for this is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, it is <hi>good</hi>: the word signifieth honest, beautiful, excellent: it is a choice work, full of beauty and comeliness, hereby you will approve your selves honest men, adorn your profession, and make the excellency

of your spirits to appear. And <hi>acceptable,</hi> very pleasing unto God, that which he takes abundant delight and contentment in. Such <hi>sacrifices</hi> are of a <hi>sweet</hi> smelling savour, so be it they are offered up with pure hearts, and clean hands. You need not fear that God will cast these petitions out of doors; no, no, you shall be very welcome, when you come upon such errands. Christ our Savior is so far from opposing civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and earthly Princes, as that your praying for them is exceeding acceptable unto him.</p>
            <p>It is our duty to pray for our Rulers and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> such as are in Authority over us We have a proverb among us, <hi>Honest men will pay their debts,</hi> this is no less; and though we pray for them <hi>fervently,</hi> with all our hearts, and our desires of their good is the common cry of all within us; though we pray for them <hi>continually,</hi> and in every one of our approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to God, yet we must say, <hi>It was no more then our duty.</hi> This is no matter of choice, not left to our selves whether we will do it or no, if we neglect it, they may put in their <hi>Bill</hi> against us in Gods Court, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <hi>damages.</hi> Prayer is a debt which we owe unto our Governors upon a three-fold account.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>First, we owe it unto them as they are <hi>men.</hi> The Apostle here would have prayers made for all men, for men of all Nations,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64521:22"/>
Jews, and Greeks, Barbarians, Scythians, men of <hi>all sorts,</hi> whether they be high or low, rich or poor, honorable or base, good or bad, yet as they are men, pray for them. For <hi>all men,</hi> even your enemies, that hate you and persecute you, and speak all maner of evil of you, and do all maner of mischief to you. For this we before gave you Christs precept and pattern, let me shew you how others of the Saints being acted by the same <hi>spirit,</hi> have done the same <hi>thing. Moses</hi> stood up in the gap for those that shewed little love to him. The children of <hi>Israel</hi> murmured against him and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 14.2. yet he prays for them, <hi>verse</hi> 19. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don I beseech thee, the iniquity of this peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le, according unto the greatness of thy mercy. Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> speak against him, Num. 12.1. yet if she be leprous, he will desire God to work a cure, <hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>He cryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.</hi> The ungrateful Israelites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Samuel,</hi> were weary of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, chose them another Head; yet he will wish them well still: if he may not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the power of a <hi>Prince,</hi> he will not fail in doing the office of a <hi>Priest</hi>: if he may not give <hi>Laws</hi> to them, he will put up <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> for them, and give wholesom <hi>instructions</hi> to them; he will be their <hi>Counceller,</hi> if not their <hi>Commander.</hi> 1 Sam. 12.23. <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I should sin against the Lord, in cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64521:22"/>
to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right way.</hi> Though <hi>Davids</hi> enemies rejoyced in his adversity, yet when the wheel was turned, when Providence <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored</hi> him and <hi>frowned</hi> upon them, he was so far from trampling upon them down, as that he could run to God for them; so far from rejoycing <hi>in,</hi> as that he had tears to shed <hi>over</hi> their calamities, 35 <hi>Psal.</hi> 13, 14. As for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sack cloth, I humbled my soul with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and my prayer returned into mine own bosom, I behaved my self as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. <hi>Stephen</hi> was earnest with God for his persecutors, <hi>Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we should pray for al men though wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, though haters of God, though enemies to us, yet they are men. <hi>Men</hi> who were made for the enjoyment of, and communion with God, and if they be strangers to it, the more to be pitied and prayed for. <hi>Men,</hi> whose hearts are in the hand of the Lord, so that he can turn them as the rivers of water. <hi>Men,</hi> who may (for ought we know) belong to the election of grace, and so in due time be effectually and savingly wrought upon. For God hath his number among the worst, and Divine Grace loves to shew it self om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent in conquering the greatest, proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64521:23"/>
and most stubborn enemies. Thus pray for all men; Princes are but men, and therefore pray for them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We owe it unto them as they are <hi>Magistrates</hi>; Men in place of Power and Authority, there is not the <hi>meanest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> in a family, not the Groom in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Scullion in the Kitchin, but he should be cared for; provided with neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries when well, and lookt after, when sick; but all in the house, one and other should contribute towards the good and advantage, comfort and contentment of him who is the <hi>Master</hi> thereof. If he be ill, the whole family suffers, and is out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and therefore they do all desire his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and are willing to run and go, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no pains too much for him. And so it is in the natural body; there is not the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest member,</hi> but it shares in the care of the other members, if one member suffer, saith the Apostle, all the members suffer with it; but they will all much more joyn together and unite their forces, and act for the good and welfare of the <hi>Head.</hi> So it is in a nation, the <hi>Body Politick</hi>; the meanest and lowest persons in it should be prayed for, and their good should be studied and promoted; you do, or at least should look after the <hi>poor</hi> in your parishes who live upon alms, whose miseries are not felt by others, whose death would be no loss to others, when they being
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64521:23"/>
sick and weak, put up their Bills in our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and beg our prayers, it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to remember them, and to set in with God for them, and spread their conditions, distempers and wants before the Lord, how much more then ought this to be done for him who is the <hi>Head</hi> of this Body, from whom the whole hath guidance &amp; direction</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we owe it to them as our <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whom God is graciously pleased to make instrumental for our good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they are the <hi>golden pipes</hi> through which precious and comfortable mercies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us. I know this age affords those among us, who will not subscribe unto me herein, but overlook the <hi>mercies</hi> which they receive, because they do not like the <hi>hand</hi> by which they are sent. A discontented spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit possesseth the mindes of too too many, which either <hi>blindes</hi> their eyes, so that they will not see the blessings which they enjoy, or <hi>hardens</hi> their hearts, so as not to own and be thankful for what they see. Very few are truly affected with Gods goodness, or truly thankful for National mercies. Certainly there is never a gracious and considerate person in <hi>England,</hi> but will readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>many things are out of order,</hi> and for this they groan, and wish it otherwise. For the divisions among Brethren, for the errors, heresies and blasphemies that abound among us, for the want of an established
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64521:24"/>
Government in the Church, according to the minde of Christ, and for other things, good hearts mourn. And on this behalf such as bear good will to our English <hi>Sion,</hi> pour out their souls before God in prayers and tears. Yet let us not be so <hi>peevish</hi> children as to <hi>throw away</hi> what we have, because we have not all we would; nor wish our selves in <hi>Egypt</hi> again, because we have not as yet the possession of the <hi>promised Land.</hi> Thus to do, is the ready way to provoke God to shut us out thence with an <hi>Oath,</hi> and to swear that <hi>we shall never enter into his rest.</hi> Hereby we shall not prevail with God for what we <hi>want,</hi> but provoke him to deprive us of what we <hi>have.</hi> Doubtless, if we will act ingeniously and as becomes us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confess, that God hath made our present Rulers instruments of much good to us and the whole Land. <hi>That we have peace and protection, is something,</hi> there are those that would have swallowed us up quick. That we may sit under our roofs in quiet, and enjoy our own, none to make us afraid, <hi>is something</hi>: there are those who would have stript us of all, and rejoyced to see us begging our bread from door to door. The Saints in the 11 <hi>Heb.</hi> who wandred up and down in sheep-skins and goat-skins desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, afflicted and tormented, would have set an high price upon this mercy. That we enjoy the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and have liberty to meet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64521:24"/>
together, and <hi>worship</hi> God in season and out of season, <hi>is something,</hi> they would have thought it so, who walked in darkness, had not the word of God powerfully preached among them, and could not without danger repair to those places in which it was so preached. In a word, that we may (if we will) have Ordinances purely administred, the holy separated from the profane, <hi>is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> they cannot but think so, who do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what a burthen unto their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences unlawful mixtures, not long since, were. Questionless, Brethren, these are mercies of no small magnitude: We have <hi>prayed</hi> for them, and <hi>wept</hi> for them, and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted</hi> for them, and spent much <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>treasure</hi> for them, and it would be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an heart very much out of frame, should we now slight and undervalue them. Those blessed Saints that are gone before us, and are now in Heaven maintaining an everlasting sabbath, would have blessed God while they lived, if they had but enjoyed that which we do now enjoy, and therefore we have reason to do so too; And by way of expressing our thankfulness, let us pray for our Magistrates, who have been a means of bringing over these good things to us. And as for those mercies which we <hi>want,</hi> let us pray for our Magistrates, that through their means, they may be <hi>supplied</hi>; as for those things that are <hi>amiss</hi> and out of order among us, let us pray for our Magistrates,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64521:25"/>
that by their means they may be <hi>rectified,</hi> every stone of stumbling taken out of the way, the work of Reformation compleated, and the <hi>Head-stone</hi> of the spiritual Temple <hi>brought forth with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.</hi> By all that hath been spoken, you may plainly see, that to pray for Kings and such as are in authority, is a piece of duty, and no more then what we owe unto them, as they are men, as they are Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and as they are Benefactors. The third and last Reason is this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Governors and such as are in Authority, have need of prayers, their necessity calls upon us to be much in actings of this nature. There is not the lowest and meanest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who is placed in the <hi>narrowest sphere</hi> of activity, and whose work lieth within the smallest compass, but is constrained always, but more especially at some times to call in the help of his Fellow-christians, and see cause to rejoyce and bear up his spirit with this, that he hath a <hi>stock of prayers</hi> going in other hands, that Saints all the world over are praying for him; But those who are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in an <hi>higher and larger sphere,</hi> who have greater work and more publick imployment cut out for them, have much more need of prayers, Thus <hi>Ministers</hi> in the Church, who are the <hi>Guides, Overseers, Pastors, Leaders</hi> of the flock of Christ, have need of prayers. <hi>Paul,</hi> though an <hi>Apostle,</hi> a man singularly learned, eminently gifted, furnished with a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64521:25"/>
great measure of grace, extraordinarily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted from above, yet could not be without prayers; and therefore he doth most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly beg them in sundry of his Epistles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.19. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.25. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. Now I beseech you, Brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christs sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me, in your prayers to God for me. <hi>Pray for me, I say, pray for me, I say, quoth Father</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Pray for me, pray for me, for Gods sake pray for me,</hi> said holy <hi>Bradford.</hi> Ministers should have a special interest in their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prayers, for they have great need of them, and so have Magistrates too. As they cannot be without <hi>subjects,</hi> so neither can they well be without <hi>praying</hi> subjects: that prince is not like to live wel, nor raign well, not like to do his duty, nor to be a blessing to the nation, who is shut out of the prayers of the Saints. The Head in the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cannot say to the meanest member, I have no need of thee, some way or other it may be useful and serviceable to it. Truly so the Prince who is the Head of the Body Politick cannot say to the meanest subject, I have no need of thee: he that is the <hi>foot</hi> in that body, may <hi>go</hi> to heaven, and <hi>fetch</hi> a blessing from thence upon him.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64521:26"/>
great persons have more need of prayers then any men in the world. <hi>Great expences</hi> do call <hi>a good purse,</hi> and large Revenues to bear them out. An Earl or Noble-man must have a greater estate then an ordinary Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, since he must keep a greater house, and live at an higher rate. Oh the expences of Princes are more then most men dream of, they are continually <hi>laying</hi> out, and so had need that some should be by prayer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually <hi>laying up</hi> for them. But we shall by sundry particulars make this evident to you.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Princes need your prayers, because their <hi>employment is great.</hi> Many men are apt to envy them the <hi>Crown,</hi> because it is made of <hi>gold,</hi> but they little consider, that it is lined with <hi>care,</hi> and is heavy enough to make their heads ake: It is true, Diadems and Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters are <hi>glittering</hi> things, and they <hi>dazle</hi> the eyes of those that see them, but believe it, they make their <hi>hands weary</hi> that sway them. The <hi>burden</hi> which lieth upon their backs is weighty, and so they cannot be without good <hi>supporters.

The <hi>skain</hi> of affairs is exceedingly <hi>snarled,</hi> and an ordinary wisdom or patience will not serve for the <hi>unwinding</hi> of it. <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> thought he could guide the Chariot of the Sun well enough, and rule the horses at his pleasure, but he <hi>set the world on fire</hi>: when a person is sick, and near unto death, a little childe may see and say, he is so, but it is not so easie to cure the disease, to purge out the ill humors that feed it, and restore health unto the Patient. Kitchin-physick is very useful, but it will not serve every turn: there are many <hi>diseases</hi> in a Nation which will puzzle and non-plus the wisest <hi>Physicians</hi>; yea though they know what is very good, &amp; a proper remedy, yet the body is so weak and distempered, as that they scarce dare admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister it.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Princes stand in need of your prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>they are but men.</hi> Indeed they are men in an <hi>higher place,</hi> men in a <hi>greater, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> men of <hi>larger signification</hi> then others, yet they are but men still. It is true, the Lord hath said they are <hi>Gods,</hi> because they be his <hi>Vice-gerents,</hi> are clothed with his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and because they are <hi>to act for God,</hi> to do his will, and to seek his glory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should <hi>act like God,</hi> holily, just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteously, without fear or favor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality; but they are such <hi>Gods as are full of imperfections,</hi> men that not onely live in houses of clay, clothed with mortality, but men that carry about with them a body of sin and death. They <hi>are men subject to like passions</hi> with us, men incompassed with <hi>infirmities</hi> like us, men full of <hi>sin</hi> like us, they are <hi>frail</hi> men, <hi>vain</hi> men, <hi>erring</hi> men, not onely <hi>vanity,</hi> but a <hi>lie</hi>; men that confidence is not to be placed in: <hi>Stars</hi> indeed of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64521:29"/>
first magnitude, but which may be drawn down from heaven; they are men that have need of direction, help, and succour from above. Indeed some of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours would needs be accounted and worshipped as Gods, but therein they were worse then <hi>beasts,</hi> as bad as <hi>devils.</hi> Now since they are men, they are liable to mistakes: It is not in man to direct his steps, if man be left to himself to make <hi>choice of his own way,</hi> he will <hi>never walk in Gods way. Adam</hi> was a perfect man, had no sin, yet he found out many inventions: God <hi>left</hi> him to his own power and free will, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately he <hi>lost</hi> himself, cut his own throat, and all his childrens too, and ever since his fall, his posterity knew not how to <hi>reconcile</hi> themselves to their own <hi>happiness.</hi> Now, <hi>Humanum est errare,</hi> error is natural unto man; and to forsake the royal way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and righteousness, is (as one phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it) <hi>triste mortalitatis privilegium,</hi> the sad priviledge of mankinde. When man fell, he so lamed himself, and broke all the powers of his soul, as that he cannot stand one moment, unless the hand of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency be graciously pleased to hold him up. And this is the condition not only of some, or of many, or the most men, but of all: thus it is with the greatest, the highest, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest, the best. Though <hi>David</hi> was after Gods own heart, yet but a man, and so through infirmity he fell fouly, and brought
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64521:30"/>
thereby not onely a <hi>sword</hi> upon his house, but also a <hi>plague</hi> upon <hi>Israel.</hi> Now so long as they are weak men, in a state of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they have need of prayers. Indeed when once men come to be perfect, they shall pray no more: in heaven <hi>prayers</hi> are turned into <hi>praises, supplications</hi> into <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>; it is as vain to <hi>pray for,</hi> as it is to <hi>pray to</hi> Saints above, unless it be for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of their bodies, which are left in the grave as silver in a refining pot, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purified, throughly freed from all dross and corruption, shall at the last day be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up, and reunited to their souls. But for men in a state of imperfection, full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, subject to failings, prayer is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely &amp; constantly necessary. But then lastly</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Princes and such as are in authority have need of prayers, because <hi>their miscarriages are of dangerous consequence to the whole.</hi> A good prince is a <hi>common good,</hi> the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fares the better for him; whereas a wicked one is a <hi>publick evil,</hi> the whole land suffers by him. When those that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be gracious, men fearing God, the righteous increase, they swarm like an hive of Bees in a warm sunny day. If he that is <hi>godly sit in the throne,</hi> you may easily guess who shall be <hi>the Favorites at Court,</hi> whereas when the <hi>wicked</hi> rise, <hi>a man is hidden,</hi> a good man, an holy man, a man set for God lies close, hath no heart to appear, keeps within doors, not finding it safe walking abroad.

Thus <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Saul, Elijah</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, Obadiahs</hi> Clients from <hi>Iezebel, Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> from <hi>Iehojakim, Ioseph and the Childe Iesus</hi> from <hi>Herod,</hi> those <hi>Worthies</hi> of whom the world was not worthy, from <hi>Antiochus,</hi> &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persecuters; &amp; the <hi>Christian</hi> Church from <hi>Antichrist.</hi> She fled into the wilderness from the face of the dragon, 12 <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. so that she was not to be sought in <hi>tectis &amp; exterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri pompa, sed potius in carceribus &amp; spelun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> in palaces of worldly pomp, and among the great ones of the earth, but in dens and caves, and dungeons; so that a miscarrying Prince is a <hi>plague</hi> to a Nation. A distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in <hi>any part</hi> of the body should be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked to, and care taken for the speedy removal of it, since none knows what it may issue in, if suffered to get strength; but if a distemper seizeth once upon the <hi>vitals,</hi> it is incurable, and threatens destruction, disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to the whole. I may compare the chief <hi>Rulers</hi> in a Nation, to the <hi>Vitals</hi> in the body, if that they be distempered, the Land is well near <hi>mortally sick,</hi> sick unto death. If the whole <hi>head</hi> be <hi>sick,</hi> and the whole <hi>heart faint,</hi> wonder not, if the next news you hear be, that from the sole of the foot, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head, there is <hi>no soundness</hi> in it, but <hi>wounds and bruises, and putrified sores.</hi> Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King is a childe, saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles. 10.16. Here is not meant a <hi>childe in years, Iosiah</hi> was so, and also our <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi> and yet it was

well with the Land in their days; But by <hi>childe</hi> here understand a <hi>weak and wicked King,</hi> that lets loose the golden reins of Government, is acted by his lusts, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by his passions, which way soever they will drive him. Wo to that Land, whose Prince is a <hi>profane</hi> wicked person, a <hi>careless</hi> person, an <hi>heady</hi> wilful person. Wo to that Land, whose Prince is not <hi>directed</hi> by the spirit of God, nor <hi>curbed</hi> by the fear of God, nor <hi>constrained</hi> by the love of God. Wo to that Land, whose Prince hath neither <hi>grace</hi> in his <hi>heart,</hi> nor <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>eye.</hi> Evils in Princes are the worst and greatest evils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have the strongest influence; if the <hi>Pilot</hi> miscarry, the <hi>Ship</hi> is lost. Thus you see it clearly proved to you, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have need of prayers; and so have we done with the Reasons, and finished the Doctrinal part. Give me leave to speak something, though but a little, by way of Use</p>
            <p>And here I might justly take up a bitter complaint <hi>of,</hi> and order out a sharp repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension <hi>unto</hi> those who neglect this piece of their duty. Some out of <hi>a profane spirit,</hi> who spend days, weeks, and moneths, and yeers without prayer, they enjoy many mercies, but they were never of their seeking: If God wil do good to themselves or others, he may, but he shall never be desired by them. How many are there that shut prayer, and the whole worship of God out of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and closets, and they that will not pray
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64521:31"/>
for <hi>themselves,</hi> will never be suitors for <hi>others</hi>; if they will not beg their own lives, the <hi>lives of their souls,</hi> at the hands of God, they will not beg their <hi>Princes peace</hi> and prosperity: But let such men know, God hath wrath, <hi>pure</hi> wrath, fierce wrath, <hi>full</hi> vials of wrath to poure out upon the Heathen, that know him not, and upon the families that call not upon his name. God doth not heare from them now, but one day they shall hear from him, yea a terrible sound shall be in their ears, and the terrours of the Almighty shall make them afraid. Others neglect this duty out of a <hi>private spirit,</hi> who do indeed pray, and make conscience of it too, dare not omit it, but they extend their care no further then themselves, their thoughts are wholly taken up about their own private interest. They can pray for blessings upon themselves, and upon their families, but that is all, and so things be well at home, they care not how they go abroad. <hi>Paul</hi> complained of this in the 2 <hi>Philip.</hi> 21. all seek their own things, and not the things which are Jesus Christs: the things of Christ are shouldered out, and the interest of the Church is not studied, self-interest, like <hi>Aarons rod</hi> swalloweth up all other, and drowns the glory of God and the publique good; but this spirit is <hi>below a man,</hi> Heathens will condemn it. It is said of <hi>Cato,</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64521:32"/>
lay upon him. This spirit is <hi>below a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> and unworthy of the Gospel, which teacheth us to look, not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others; <hi>Timothy</hi> is said naturally to care for the Churches welfare. This spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>is hateful to all men</hi>; he that is wholly shut up within himself is an odious person, and the place he lives in longs for a vomit to spue him out. In a word, this spirit is <hi>condemned by reason it self,</hi> what dost thou think will become of thy <hi>Cabin,</hi> if the <hi>Ship</hi> miscarry? It is not like thy <hi>Closet</hi> should stand, when the <hi>house</hi> is burnt down. Others there are who utterly lay aside this duty out <hi>of a froward and discontented spirit,</hi> who like <hi>Flies</hi> feed upon the <hi>sores</hi> of Magistrates, thereby hindering a cure, but will not go to heaven for a <hi>plaister</hi> that they may be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they do not like the hand which sways the Scepter, nor the things that are done by him who sits in the throne, and therefore they will not so far befriend him, as to give him a room in their Petitions: They will shut him out of their prayers, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve all his doings; and yet they may finde fault where there is none, and look upon that with an evil eye, which in it self is matter and ground of thankfulness. Let persons that are guilty of this neglect, from what principle soever they act, know, that they have <hi>little sense of the mercies</hi> which they enjoy. Were Gods goodness to us in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64521:32"/>
our Governours eyed, and the blessings which by them we receive laid to heart, and seriously considered of, they would work another frame of spirit in you. Such as these are <hi>small friends to our English Zion,</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much beholding to them, is it not? how can it be thought they should spend their estates, shed their blood, hazard their lives for the Nation, who will not be at the cost of a few prayers for its prosperity: I might also tell them, that they will have <hi>little thanks for their forbearance</hi> at the last, and that if the Nation miscarry, its ruine may be laid at their doors. If the wrath of God breaks in upon us like a sea and drowns all, it was because you came not up to stand in the gap: If God departs from <hi>England,</hi> and carries his Gospel, and spiritual and temporal Mercies along with him, we may thank you, and such as you are; he would have stayed, if he had been but more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But I shall wave those things, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an <hi>Vse of Exhortation.</hi> And,</p>

the wilderness, preserved us from the rage and fury of our enemies, and brought us within sight of the promised Land, gave up the ghost, laid down his <hi>leading-staff</hi> and his life together, with whose fall the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was shaken; his death covered all the faces of sober and considerate persons with paleness, and their hearts with sadness, as if Peace, and Prosperity, Reformation, the Gospel, all lay drawing on, and would be buried in the same grave with him. But, blessed be God, Divine Grace vouchsafed to cast an eye toward us, and to visit us in our low estate; there is <hi>another Pilot</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his room; while he <hi>directs the course,</hi> let us fill the <hi>sayls</hi> with our <hi>praying breath.

Let us not be deaf to the <hi>cry</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Necessities, nor to the <hi>call</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Rulers, but let us up and be doing, and the Lord will be with us. You that never prayed before, pray now, you have been strangers to the work, and careless of the Nation long enough already. You that have <hi>prayed formerly,</hi> continue your acquaintance with that work still, and double your forces now. Blessed be God, something hath been already done this day among us here, and we are not alone; there is a sacrifice almost upon every Altar; throughout the Nation there are those that be putting to their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand, and are <hi>tugging</hi> for mercy, let us joyn with them, and <hi>pull hard</hi>; God is not yet gone, oh pray that he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of our Coasts: We are not yet <hi>past hope,</hi> pray that God would give us to see the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64521:34"/>
desire of our hearts: Our disease is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, though it may puzzle the <hi>wisest men,</hi> yet it cannot non-plus the infinitely <hi>wise God</hi>; oh pray that God would be our Physitian, and undertake for us. Our Prince <hi>riseth</hi> gloriously, pray that he might not <hi>set</hi> in a cloud: Our <hi>hopes</hi> concerning him are great, pray that they may not be <hi>blasted.</hi> Who knows what we <hi>may</hi> do, if we would but do what we can; grant that there is but a peradventure, yet let that prevail. The Nation <hi>may be lost,</hi> but let not that dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you, for it <hi>may be saved,</hi> and let that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you. <hi>Ionah</hi> preacht, yet forty days and <hi>Nineveh</hi> shall be overthrown, here was great ground of fear; that judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denounced by the Prophet upon the commandment of the Lord, but, saith the King, let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but why so? the sentence is gone out, hath the Lord said it, and shall he not do it? nay, but who can tell if God will turn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64521:34"/>
prayer poured out among us, I would not question but that God would open the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of his mercy, and rain down upon us a blessing in abundance. I will here lay downe something by way of direction, and then by way of Motive and so conclude. By way of direction take onely these two things. Pray Fervently and Constantly.</p>
            <p>First, pray fervently. You must <hi>fire</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sacrifice, if you would have it ascend as high as heaven. He will never hit the marke, who doth not draw the arrow up to the <hi>head.</hi> Therfore call forth all your powers, muster up all your forces, all your praying <hi>graces,</hi> all your praying <hi>affections,</hi> and go to the throne of grace as strong as you can. It is the effectuall fervent prayer of a righteous man that availeth much. If the Child do onely <hi>wrangle a little,</hi> it may ly still in the cradle, and be neglected, but if once it <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fiercely,</hi> and cannot otherwise be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then will the Mother draw her Breast. See that what you desire be good, and that your end in desiring it be right, and then cry mightily. <hi>Luther</hi> said, <hi>Vtinam sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eodem ardore orare possem</hi>; would to God I could alwaies pray with the same Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Fervency, for then I should alwaies have this answer, <hi>Fiat quod velis.</hi> Be it unto thee even as thou wilt. They that would return <hi>Hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urably,</hi> must set out <hi>Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly</hi>; wrestling with God is the onely way to prevaile like Princes; oh therefore be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64521:35"/>
There are many to <hi>hinder,</hi> and if you would obtain, you must be <hi>importunate.</hi> Englands sins do abound, and they are as so many middle walls between Gods ear and your Prayers, you must <hi>cry aloud</hi> if you would be heard. They lie as so many rubs in the way of mercy, lay out all your strength for the removing of them. When a Peoples <hi>transgressions</hi> are many, and their <hi>prayers</hi> are cold, reason will tell us, that their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations</hi> must neds be low, no sacrifice will be accepted but the male in the Flock. If you offer to God the Blind, and the Lame, cold, dead, formal prayers, they are so far from being a sweet-smelling savour, as that they are like the Cutting of a Dogs neck, or offering swines flesh, an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord. Let all, saith the King of Nineveh, <hi>cry,</hi> yea <hi>cry mightily</hi> unto God. We can never thinke, that God should be <hi>prevailed</hi> with by those prayers, with which we our selves are not at all <hi>affected.</hi> The Church complains in the 64 Isa. 7. There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that <hi>stirreth up himself</hi> to take hold of thee. No wonder. If God doth not <hi>rise</hi> to our help, if we do not <hi>stir</hi> up our selves to take hold of him, dull and sleepy prayers are never like to awaken Gods arm. But then</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, pray constantly, prayer is the work not of an <hi>houre,</hi> but of a <hi>life</hi>; not onely of a <hi>fasting</hi> day, but of <hi>every</hi> day. It is not enough to send out one messenger to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64521:35"/>
but we must speed away one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If a petition be sent to Court, and none to follow it, it will come to nothing, the thing will not be granted: he that <hi>faints</hi> in prayer, will <hi>fail</hi> of mercy. When an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my beleagures a Town, they do not give over at the first or second repulse, nor leave it unless a surrender be presently made, but there they lie week after week, and storm it time after time, and never give over till they are Masters of it. Thus when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege the Throne of Grace with our prayers, we must not be discouraged, though we do not presently obtain, nor be put out of heart with the first or second refusal, but continue the work, and renew our requests. Shrink not back like cowards in war, but stand your ground: Prayer must be <hi>redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> and <hi>reinforced,</hi> like those arrows of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.19. Smite five or six times, and though you seem to strike a rock, yet give not over until the waters gush out:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> : 18 43, 44.</note> go up to the top of the hill, and though you see nothing, yet go again and again, a cloud will appear at last. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> prayed on, though often denied, and reproached too. <hi>Iacob</hi> kept his hold, when his thigh was lamed, and would not let the angel go until he had blessed him, he would sooner <hi>die</hi> then be <hi>denied.</hi> God expects we should wait upon him, and it is <hi>good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> in us so to do. Indeed God doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>prevent</hi> his peoples prayers, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64521:36"/>
before they call, sometimes he <hi>meets</hi> them; and while they are upon the way he falls upon their necks, and kisseth them, but at other times he <hi>defers</hi> the grant, and sends them away without that which they come for; he will hear <hi>often</hi> from them, before they shall hear <hi>once</hi> from him; but it doth not become them at such a time to be so short breathed, as to cast the duty off: No, <hi>multiply</hi> your requests till God doth <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi> his goodness. You have, it may be, prayed many times against such and such <hi>burthens,</hi> and yet you groan under them; against such <hi>distempers,</hi> and yet you do not see the healing of them; against such <hi>abuses,</hi> and yet they are not removed; but what of all that? will you therefore give over, and pray no more? seek God no more? what would this be but to <hi>loose all</hi> your labor, and wilfully to <hi>throw away</hi> all your former pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and truly they are <hi>too good to loose.</hi> Give the Lord no rest until he give in unto you an answer of peace. The Merchant doth not lay aside his Calling, because he hath made a bad Voyage; <hi>etiam post naufragium t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tantur maria,</hi> though he hath suffered shipwrack he will try again. God hid his face from the house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet would <hi>Isaiah</hi> look for him, and wait upon him. Those Mercies are fullest and fairest, and taste sweetest, which are longest looked for. So much may suffice for Direction, take these following Motives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:64521:36"/>First, <hi>You will do your duty</hi>; I hope this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hath been so fully cleared up by what hath been all along said, that there is none will question it; you have heard this is the <hi>will of God,</hi> that which he <hi>requires and approves,</hi> calls for from you, and accepts in you: It is that which you owe to them as they are <hi>Men,</hi> as they are <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and as they are <hi>instrumental</hi> causes or means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many and choice Mercies to you. Now it becomes Christians to make conscience of duty, yea of every duty: Our obedience ought to be of equal length and breadth with the revealed will of God; we must not pick and choose, doing this, and leaving that undone, but every precept must pass <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> which hath Gods name and authority <hi>instampt</hi> upon it: then are we Christs disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples indeed, when we do whatsoever he commands us, and then shall we not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed. It is sad to see how Professors do their work by halfs, some are very observant of <hi>first</hi>-Table-requiries, but neglect the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>; others strict in their walking up to the commands of the <hi>second Table,</hi> but slight those of the <hi>first.</hi> Some rob from <hi>man,</hi> that they may do sacrifice to <hi>God,</hi> others neglect Gods <hi>altar,</hi> and serve mens <hi>tables,</hi> both which are an abomination. Give unto Cesar the things that are Cesars, and unto God the things which be Gods: If you would have a <hi>perfect reward</hi> at last, look to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64521:37"/>
it that you perform a <hi>perfect obedience</hi> now: besides, I am sure, duty is both safe and sweet, that way is hedged about with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and paved with pleasantness, and in the walking thereof we may groundedly expect both security and comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this hath been the practise of the people of God in all Ages, yea, when they lived under heathenish and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Princes, who designed their ruine, and thirsted for their blood, yet they did pour out their prayers for them. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertul. ad Scapu.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Christianus nullius est hostis, nedum Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoris, quem sciens a Deo suo constitui, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse est ut &amp; ipsum diligat, &amp;c.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is an enemy to no man, much less to the Emperour, but knowing him to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, it is necessary that he love, and reverence, and honor him, and desire his prosperity: And, saith he, <hi>Sacrificamus pro salute Imperatoris, sed Deo nostro &amp; ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, sed quomodo praecepit Deus pura prece.</hi> We offer up sacrifice for the Emperours health, but onely to him who is both his God and ours, and in that way which he hath commanded, by pure prayer. And so <hi>Athenagoras</hi> in his Apology for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians hath these words, <hi>Nos pro Imperio ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro preces ad Deum fundimus, &amp; ut filius in regno olim parenti succedat, ut Imperium ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum magis magisque semper augeatur, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique omnia ex animi sententia eveniant, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64521:37"/>
i.e.</hi> We pour out our prayers to God for your Empire, and intreat of him that your Son may be your Successour in the Throne, and that your Territories may be more and more enlarged, and all things answer the desire of your hearts. Let us be followers of them, who by faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have inherited the promises. If they prayed for <hi>Heathen</hi> Princes who persecuted the Truth, how much more should we pray for <hi>Christian</hi> Princes who own the Truth, and smile upon its most strict professors? Let us shew our selves to be as <hi>good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> as they, by our being as <hi>good subject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, you may in this way promote <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Nations prosperity. By prayer Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors may be made a blessing: It is true, we do not know what <hi>God may do,</hi> secret things belong to him, and we cannot look into his bosom, nor be acquainted with his counsel; but we know what <hi>prayer hath done,</hi> and how great and unexpected things have been brought to pass by it: there is a kinde of <hi>omnipotency</hi> in it, it hath helped at a dead lift: and when others have been found Physitians of no value, prayer hath wrought a cure. <hi>England</hi> hath many enemies, both at home and abroad, ever had since the first Reformation, and never more then at this day, yea, its own children are risen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, who are now seeking its ruine, and endeavor the under-mining of us: what
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64521:38"/>
they could not formerly do by <hi>force and power,</hi> that they would now do by <hi>wit and policy</hi>; but prayer can do more <hi>for us,</hi> then they can do <hi>against us.</hi> As it hath broken the bowe and the spear of the <hi>stout warrior</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so hath it turned the counsel of wise <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> into foolishness; it can turn the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man into a <hi>Coward,</hi> that he shall not finde his hands; and the wise man into an <hi>Ideot,</hi> that he shall have his brains to seek. Christians in their Assemblies, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Closets (if they will do but their duty) may fill their Rulers and Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors with wisdom, and strike rheir adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with blindeness, so that they shall not see their way, nor know how to bring their wicked and bloody devices to pass: I will assure you, let things be how they will, your adversaries never so high, your selves never so low, if you can but keep the Trade of Prayer going, the advantage is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on your side. I will se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one believing praying Christian, against a thousand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies because prayer engageth heaven, and brings in the help of Almighty power. And so, would you have your Magistrates good, pray for them, this may prevail not onely for temporal, but spiritual blessings also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The Kings heart is in Gods hand, he can turn it as rivers of water, would you have it set right, desire him to do it: God hath given in many a soul to the prayers of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64521:38"/>
his people. <hi>Praying subjects</hi> are most likely to make <hi>prudent and pious Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, while you pray for your Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> you pray for your own persons and families, in seeking <hi>their</hi> good, you promote <hi>your own.</hi> Let God but sanctifie, direct, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and protect them, you will finde the advantage of it. If you will but peruse the History of <hi>Israel,</hi> and diligently observe it, you shall finde, so long as they had good Kings that served God, and studied an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of themselves to him, it went well with the whole Nation, they had peace and plenty, victory over their enemies, and the blessings of God did abound among them. But if God forsake the Rulers of a Nation, withdraw from them his Spirit and Grace, give them up either to blindness or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to follow their own counsels, and to fulfil their own lusts, you shall soon in your families and the Nation feel the smart, and taste the bitter fruits of it. When the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were wicked, all went to ruine, the Nation lay bleeding, and the people were sometimes oppressed by their <hi>own Princes,</hi> at other times spoyled and led captives by their <hi>enemies.</hi> So that in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, you seek and further your own welfare.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, you pray for Religion while you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> pray for them. This should be very dear to us, and no cost nor pains should be thought
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64521:39"/>
too much for the maintaining and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereof: and truly that cannot be safe, unless we have Religious Governors; they that are of the <hi>synagogue</hi> of Satan will not build, or repair, or maintain Gods <hi>temple.</hi> If you would not have a <hi>lawless liberty</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others, pray that your Governours may be <hi>strict</hi> themselves; if you would not have others infected and poisoned with <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> pray that your Governors may embrace the <hi>Truth,</hi> and be valiant for it. The <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of Christians are <hi>State</hi>-Christians, are not so deeply <hi>dyed,</hi> but they can change their <hi>colour,</hi> when they once see it out of <hi>fashion.</hi> It hath been all along seen, that the <hi>Religion of a Nation</hi> hath been according to the <hi>Governors of a Nation</hi>: if they be holy, then the true Religion thrives, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers, and flourisheth under their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>adow; but if they be corrupt, the door stands open to error, heresie, and indeed, what not? It is true, in the time of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> God told <hi>Elijah</hi> he had yet <hi>seven thousand</hi> knees that had not bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality were idolaters; and these that kept themselves <hi>pure,</hi> did also keep themselves so <hi>private,</hi> as that the good Prophet looked upon himself as the onely man left that did own God and his cause: We need go no further then our own Land for the proving of this. Let a godly King <hi>Edward</hi> come to the throne, and there shall be an happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64521:39"/>
begun, the Nation shall become <hi>Protestant,</hi> superstition and idolatry shall seek corners and flie the Land; but if a wicked Queen <hi>Mary</hi> be advanced, she shall carry <hi>England</hi> back to <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather bring <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and Popery shall set up its <hi>Crest</hi> again. If there be no good <hi>blood at Court,</hi> there will be little found in the <hi>veins of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, in this way you will bring your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> selves peace. What ever should become of the <hi>Nation,</hi> how ever it should fare with <hi>Religion,</hi> what ever should happen to that <hi>Cause</hi> in which you have engaged, though all things should return to their former state, nay though you should be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a worse condition then ever you were in, yet this may stay and comfort your hearts, when you can say, O Lord thou knowest, I have not been wanting to my duty, there is many a <hi>prayer</hi> now upon the File in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which I have put up for <hi>England</hi>; there is many a <hi>tear</hi> now in thy bottle, which I have shed for <hi>England.</hi> This will be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to you in a day of trouble, and at the hour of death, if you have done your duty, you may rejoyce, let God do with you and the Land what he pleaseth.</p>
