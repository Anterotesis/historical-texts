         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I in all humility crave Your Highneſs

Your great Name before this Book, and
to offer you the trouble of peruſing it,
at ſuch a time, when the Affairs of Three

concerns you; It defends your Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

Princely Wiſdom and Knowledge; yet it
will ſerve to call many things to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,

            <p>When I heard how induſtriouſly this
Book of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath been diſperſed, and
how high a prejudice aroſe among the
more undiſcerning ſort, by the fine words

merited it, I have obſerved a Stile accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly

treated the man like himſelf; not that I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it, but becauſe it was neceſſary, and
the moſt proper way of Return, for due
correction, to intimate unto him, and his
admirers, as well the inſolency of his
Spirit, as the lightneſs and vanity of
his pretended Arguments. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
of them, I have given him his
own to the utmoſt, allowing him fair
play, by reciting ſome of them whole, the
reſt by parts in their full ſtrength and
force, which is more than ever he yet
gave to any adverſary in Print, it having
been his manner upon the like occaſion,
to trifle about the Out-works, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fall upon the main Fort, nor take the

an Argument lay.</p>
            <p>If this Addreſs prove unſeaſonable, I

               <hi>ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity;</hi>
in which number if he be reckoned, I do him no injury,
but have the general conſent of the Pious and Learned to
ſubſcribe to the Cenſure, together with all his own Works
to confirm it: And therefore obſerving him to be a man
of ſo elated a <hi>Supercilium,</hi> ſo audacious a Front, that he
hath dared to aſſault even Authority it ſelf, and in his
pompous way of Affectation with Strains of Oratory to
vilifie the moſt pious of their Ordinances, and trample
upon their intruſted Servants, I conceived, now the <hi>Swelling</hi>
is grown to this height, it would be an act of charity both
to himſelf and his Friends, for me to endeavour the Cure;
in order whereunto, I make uſe of no other <hi>Lancet</hi> but my
<hi>Pen,</hi> that I may meet with him at his own weapon, having
ſharpned it on purpoſe to prick the fiery <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> and let
out the Corruption: Which being done, there is hope the
man may love the Peace of the Church the better while he

Truly, 'twere high time for him to think of this in good

his diſſolution approaching, importuned</hi> to do Feats <hi>while his

to <hi>give a Teſtimony against</hi> the Commiſſioners for <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi>
and <hi>Ejection:</hi> And in his Title-page he ſets himſelf
out to be <hi>an Aged Miniſter.</hi> True; and if you look into
his Book, you will find it ſo, being arrived (I will not ſay
to Dotage, but) as one would think, to that Age of <hi>Senes
bis Pueri,</hi> wherein <hi>Old men are twice Boys,</hi> becauſe he trifleth
like any young Lad, priding himſelf all along from page

<q>Ludere par impar, equitare in arundine longa:</q>
his whole Work being but a kind of <hi>Boys-play:</hi> Inſomuch
as I muſt profeſs, in dealing with his Arguments, I was
poſſeſſed with an equal Temperature of Indignation and
Pity; Pity, to ſee him, an antient Miniſter of the Goſpel,
and one who a good while ago had a reputation of being
Conſciencious, ſo plainly to prevaricate in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
to the reviling of Authority, and abuſe of his
Brethren, even while he is (as it were) ſounding the trumpet
to his own final diſſolution, or the great day of Account:
how little theſe things were in his thoughts when he penn'd
his Book, you are left to judge by his carriage, and this my
Anſwer. On the other ſide, my Indignation aroſe, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that a man, whoſe Writings ſhew him to be a Scholar,
ſhould yet write ſo unlike a Scholar as he hath done, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
neither Rule nor Mood in matter of Argument;
but rambling through a wilderneſs of Talſities, Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
Slanders, Self-contradictions, and malicious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
inſtead of Reaſons or Inſtances, to make proof

I would not willingly be tedious; but I muſt needs have
you a little more intimately acquainted with the Man and
his Character. He is worſe than a <hi>Common Nuſance;</hi> for,
he doth not only ſtink, and annoy ſavoury Chriſtians by
his rotten Opinions, but by plain Lyes (pardon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion)
and Slanders, endeavoureth to make others of
all ſorts as unſavoury as himſelf. His Scribling Faculty is
his diſeaſe, which he labors under continually, and happy
it were for him if it would turn to the <hi>Hand-gout.</hi> His
Reaſon uſually rides poſt with pride or paſſion, and ſo is
the more eaſily over-ridden by a vaporing Phant'ſie; this
is it which gives Law to his Underſtanding, cuts out work
for all the other Faculties, makes his Pen a ready writer;
and the Windmill in the Brain keeps the Preſs always going
as if it were his Handmill; for, rather than it ſhall ſtand
ſtill, he travels through all Shops, like a Knight-errant, to
find out the Gyants in Print, making Adverſaries rather
than want them, that he may grinde them to powder.
Of a very Paper-worm, there never was a verier Tyrant in
the world: He hath a Tool betwixt the Fore-finger and
Thumb, with which he ſcrues all things to his purpoſe;
he hath made crooked things ſtrait, and ſtrait things crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at pleaſure; killed all men of ſame with as little remorſe
as <hi>Domitian</hi> didFlies;<note place="margin">Dan. 5 9.</note> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> like, <hi>thoſe
whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive, and
whom he would he ſet up, and whom he would he put down.</hi>
It hath been the wretched imployment of theſe his latter
days, and is ſtill, to go forth in the glory of this his ſtrength,
and either to take or make an occaſion to conflict with
whatſoever perſons or things he lights upon, eſpecially if
the men be in any repute or acceptation above himſelf;
Then it is he bends his Bow, makes ready bitter Arrows,
and feathers them at the Preſs, that he may take them down
a pin lower. There is not an Inſtance to be found in this
Age of ſuch another <hi>Hector,</hi> a man ſo full of Quarrels and
Conteſts with men of Conſcience and worth, as this Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
not ſparing even ſuch as he himſelf owneth for ſuch, I mean
the <hi>Commiſſioners for Approbation;</hi> (as you may ſee in his
<pb facs="tcp:52973:7"/>
Epiſtle) and tells the world before hand he eſteems them
ſuch; yet (as if it were becauſe they are ſuch, or at leaſt
becauſe they are eſteemed by others as ſuch) he lifts up
his Pen with all his might againſt them.</p>
            <p>'Twere pitty ſuch a Champion ſhould loſe the glory of
his Atchievements, and therefore to do him right, I ſhall
give you a ſhort Story of his Duels, and his other publick
Engagements, wherein I am to inlarge a little, and yet no
more than needs muſt. The ſingle perſons he hath been
in the Field with, <hi>i. e</hi> in Print, as his Adverſaries, and
whom he uſed accordingly when he got them under the
Preſſe, are theſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> Mr <hi>Gataker,</hi> Mr <hi>Walker,</hi> Mr <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
Dr <hi>Williams</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> Mr <hi>Pryn,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis
Netherſole,</hi> Mr <hi>John Geree,</hi> Mr <hi>Herbert Palmer,</hi> Dr <hi>Thomas
Goodwin,</hi> Mr <hi>Resbury,</hi> Dr <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> Dr <hi>Hill,</hi>
Mr <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi> Mr <hi>Barlow,</hi> Mr <hi>A. Steward,</hi> (in
particular Books printed) beſides ſeveral Members of his
own Church that he hath written againſt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others: Thus you ſee what a notable Duelliſt he
hath been.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; for, this <hi>Tenth Worthy</hi> hath been ſo
adventurous as to engage alſo with whole Troops and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments,
in the confidence of his own perſonal and ſingle
valour; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> the
<hi>Miniſters of the Province of London,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters of Sion-Colledge,
thoſe Miniſters that ſubſcribed a Petition to the
Lord Fairfax,</hi> part of the <hi>Company of Stationers,</hi> the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of <hi>Dort;</hi> and in this Treatiſe he challengeth forth the
Commiſſioners for <hi>Approving,</hi> and thoſe for <hi>Ejecting</hi> of
Miniſters, men of the greateſt Eminency and worth His
Highneſs, with the Advice of his Council, could pitch
upon in and about the City, and in every Shire throughout
the Nation. Nay, he goes further yet, and ventureth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
to provoke his Highneſs and Council in a moſt unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and unchriſtian manner, cauſing them to undergo the
<hi>Ordeal</hi> of his fiery flying Pamphlet, turning the edge of his
Pen againſt them, and ſhamefully reproaching them in the
eyes of the People, as he himſelf, in his <hi>Poſtſcript to the
<pb facs="tcp:52973:7"/>
Reader,</hi> acknowledgeth his words may bear ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
viz. <hi>as ſavouring of an undue liberty, and want of
reverence to thoſe that are in Authority;</hi> yet inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
the matter, he goeth on in the ſame <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> to
juſtifie and exalt himſelf above all Authority, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to give ſeveral Reaſons for it. As 1. Becauſe <hi>the
great men of the Earth might he in danger, if he ſhould not give
them ſeaſonable ſmitings. 2. That theſe ſmitings are more the
Reproofs of Jeſus Chriſt than of man;</hi> by which you ſee
how he ſpares not <hi>even Chriſt himſelf,</hi> but endeavours
to entitle him as Patron of his lewd extravagancies againſt
our Rulers. 3. <hi>Becauſe Kings, Princes, and Rulers, are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to theſe Reproofs</hi> (or ſmitings) <hi>as well as meaner men.
4. Becauſe Reprovers</hi> (or Smiters) <hi>in the Name of Chriſt
are not in this to reſpect perſons. 5. Laſtly, Becauſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
(viz. himſelf) <hi>ſtands particularly and publickly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to this;</hi> for he boaſts, he hath formerly defended their
Authority, and therefore ought now to have a Licenſe to
ſmite them. Excellent good! He, in the pride of his heart,
looks upon himſelf as the man that is, and ought to be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
above all that is called God on earth, being no leſs
than the Pope or Chriſt's Vicar, in the Name of Chriſt to
cenſure the proceedings of Princes, and reprove or ſmite
the Potentates, Rulers, &amp; great men of the Earth, they being
in their Actions ſubject to his Judgement and Correction,
he being the man out of all the Tribes and Kindreds of the
People, ſeparated and ſet apart (in his own conceit) for
the exerciſe of this Pontifical Authority over his Highneſs;
as if he meant to uſurp the Papal Chair, and turn out Pope
<hi>Alexander</hi> the ſeventh. And yet this is not all; for, as if he
meant alſo to be no leſs than <hi>Alexander the great,</hi> it was well
obſerved lately by a Gentleman in my hearing, that as
King <hi>Alexander</hi> having conquer'd the world, is ſaid to have
ſighed becauſe there were no more worlds to conquer, ſo
he having (in his own Opinion) triumphed over a world
of Penmen, and Powers, wanting work elſewhere, hath
now turned his Arms againſt a greater (in his own eyes)
than all theſe put together; even againſt his ſacred ſelf;
<pb facs="tcp:52973:8"/>
moſt ſhamefully contradicting himſelf in many places,
and thereby hath given the world to underſtand what a
Shuttle-cock this Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is, who hath ſo ſet out himſelf
with his own Pen, and in Print too, that the Nation may
know he careth not to have his wit, and reaſon, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
and all obſcured together, rather then his ſparkling
Phantſie ſhould not ſhine in its brightneſs.</p>
            <p>And theſe things he hath done, not in Anonymous ſmall
Kites and Pamphlets, but in grave and (as he thinks)
goodly Treatiſes, which he hath ſet his name to in Capital
Letters; and out of which I ſhall give you three or four
Inſtances of the Combats he hath had with himſelf, upon
the open Stage.</p>
            <p>One while you have him for the King; as in that Book
of his, called <hi>Anticavalieriſm,</hi> page 10, 11. where you
may read this following Paſſage.</p>
            <p>As for offering violence to the perſon of a King, or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take away his life, we leave the proof of the lawfulneſs
of this to thoſe profound diſputers the Jeſuites, who ſtand enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the tenure of their profeſſed Doctrine and Practice,
either to make good the lawfulnes thereof, or elſe to leave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Religion and abhorring and hiſſing to the world.
As for us who never travelled with deſires or thoughts that
way, but abhor both Mother and Daughter, Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
together, we conceive it to be the juſt Prerogative of the
perſons of Kings, in what caſe ſoever, to be ſecure from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of men, and their lives to be as conſecrated Corn, meet
to be reaped and gathered onely by the hand of God himſelf.
<hi>David</hi>'s Conſcience ſmote him, when he came but ſo neer the
life of a King, as the cutting off of the lap of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not long after, contrary to all this, he wrote that Book
entituled,</hi> A Defence of the Honourable Sentence paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the late King by the High Court of Juſtice. <hi>In the 73
Page whereof, writing againſt ſuch as would not have had
the King put to death, he adviſeth them to</hi> retract that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Tenet <hi>of exempting Kings from Puniſhment,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they encourage Kings to turn Tyrants, commit murthers,
<pb facs="tcp:52973:8"/>
and all abominations; that Tenet of theirs (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) I mean,
wherein they deny unto Kings the help of that Bridle for
the ruling of their luſts (more needfull for them than for any
other ſort of men) the fear of death by the Sword of Civil
Juſtice upon any occaſion whatſoever.</p>
            <p>At the latter end of the ſame Book he concludes thus:</p>
            <p>The late wars, wherein the King, by the ſword of thoſe men
of blood who caſt in their lot with him, ſhed ſo much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood in the land, being cauſeleſly (and contrary to
the frequent obteſtations, earneſt ſollicitations, grave adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Great Council the Parliament) commenced by
himſelf, are ſo far from mediating on his behalf for the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
that they open the mouth of it the wider, and cauſe it to
cry ſo much the louder for vengeance upon Him and His, both
unto God and men.</p>
            <q>Sic idem jungat vulpes, &amp; mulgeat hircos.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſecond Inſtance may be taken out of a certain Letter
of his written to</hi> T. G. <hi>againſt</hi> Independencie, <hi>which was
printed</hi> Anno 1643. <hi>condemning</hi> Separate Congregations,
(<hi>ſo he terms them in his Preface.</hi>) I am (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
as Confidence it ſelf can make me, that their way of a
Covenant is a mere humane Invention, and a ſtrain of that
wiſdom that deſires to exalt it ſelf, not only againſt men,
but against God himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> p. 10. (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) If you have the Truth with you,
woe to my Wits, Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; never poor man
ſo ſtrangely miſuſed by ſuch Friends in this world.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 13. he hath theſe words, <hi>I do profeſs in the ſight
of God, and in as great ſingleneſs and ſimplicity of heart
as ever man in this world ſpake word unto you, that I do as
clearly apprehend Error and Miſtake throughout the greatest
part of your way</hi> (that is, Independencie) <hi>as I do truth in
this Concluſion, That twice Two makes Four.</hi> A luſty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
indeed! Yet notwithſtanding, now his <hi>twice Two</hi>
doth not make <hi>Four:</hi> For, within a few moneths after, he
changed his Judgment from the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way wherein
<pb facs="tcp:52973:9"/>
he then ſtood, and profeſſed himſelf for this way which he
had ſo confidently decried, and took up the practice of it,
gathered a Separate Church in <hi>Coleman ſtreet,</hi> and wrote
divers Books in defence of this way, and with as much
confidence as before, as may be ſeen in his Books againſt
<hi>A. Steward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and other <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Third Inſtance,</hi> and which is moſt pertinent to our
purpoſe, is in reference to theſe two Commiſſions which
he flies out againſt with ſo much fury, the one for <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
and the other for <hi>Ejecting,</hi> and which he in this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
of his, makes the <hi>abhorring of his ſoul,</hi> and is angry
with his Governers about them, and tells us he ought to be
angry and to ſmite them with as much ſhame and reproach
before the World, as his Pen is able to load upon them.
Nevertheleſs, both theſe Commiſſions are no other, not
only for ſubſtance, but alſo in each material circumſtance,
then what was laid down in certain <hi>Propoſals for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Goſpel,</hi> and there diſtinctly commended one
after the other, to a Committee of Parliament appointed
to receive ſuch <hi>Propoſals, Febr.</hi> 8. 1651. as may be ſeen
in Mr <hi>Scobels</hi> Office in theſe Words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We whoſe Names are ſubſcribed, do, with others, humbly
deſire, that theſe</hi> Propoſals <hi>be preſented to the Honourable
Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. To all which Mr. <hi>John Goodwins</hi> own ſelf,
and Mr <hi>John Price</hi> one of the Elders of his Church, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with divers others, then ſubſcribed: And yet the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of his preſent Book is againſt the Magiſtrate for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch Commiſſions, as having (in his opinion) nothing
to do with propagating the Goſpel; and extream ſevere
he is in his language againſt the Commiſſioners, though the
purport of their Commiſſions to be act according to ſuch
Inſtructions as Mr <hi>G.</hi> then approved under his hand.</p>
            <p>To theſe give me leave to add a <hi>fourth Inſtance,</hi> and I
have done, it being ſuch a one as hath many Inſtances in
the belly of it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> you have him giving the
Commiſſioners what indeed is their due, declaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himſelf
concerning them in theſe Words, [<hi>I beleeve them to be men
of Conſcience, and worth, fearing God, and lovers of Truth</hi>]
<pb facs="tcp:52973:9"/>
Now let us take theſe Particulars in pieces, and ſee how he
agreeth with himſelf in his Book.</p>
            <p>1. Lovers of Truth. <hi>And yet</hi> p. 9. <hi>he intimates a</hi> bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
dominion <hi>exerciſed by them over men for holding the
Truth, and ſaith a little after,</hi> That they make the ſimple ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and profeſſing of the great and important Truths of God
a Bar againſt Preferment, p 12. <hi>He calls them</hi> Heterodox,
<hi>inſinuating,</hi> as if they held Errors againſt their inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the contrary, <hi>p</hi> 17. he makes them Counter-workers
againſt God <hi>in the work of ſending out Labourers to
preach the Truth,</hi> p 20. <hi>he ſaith,</hi> That what the Names of
ſome of the Commiſſion of <hi>Triers</hi> preſaged they have effected,
reducing the ſaid Commiſſion, in the execution of it, to a
neer affinity with the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> which accuſeth the
Romiſh Religion of cruelty and blood, and ſo of a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
fiery Antipathy to the Genius and Spirit of the Goſpel,
<hi>p</hi> 21. That they are ſuch as grind the faces, and break the
bones of men of ſignal peity and worth, who know more of
God and his Goſpel than themſelves; <hi>whom he calls a little
after,</hi> men of an erroneous and miſ grounded Faith, <hi>that uſe
men ſo, becauſe they will not comply with them in Error.
p</hi> 15. That their judgements are erroneous and deſtructive
to the precious ſouls of men; <hi>yet theſe are the men whom ere
now he ſtiled</hi> lovers of truth.</p>
            <p>2. Men of Conſcience. <hi>Nevertheleſſe,</hi> p 3. <hi>he tells them
of</hi> famiſhing men with their wives and children, onely becauſe
they will not profeſſe a beleif contrary to their Conſciences.
<hi>p 6. he ſaith,</hi> They intrench upon the Spiritual Rights and
Priviledges of the people of God, keep aſunder thoſe whom
God would have joyned together, and reject men that are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
<hi>p. 7. That</hi> they quarrel men preſented, and are not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
of the practice, whether there be any Chriſtian or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
cauſe for their acting ſo or no. <hi>Such</hi> as by their power
and ſubtilty bring about their own ends, and receive the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of thanks, if not baſer Metal, from thoſe who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
<hi>p</hi> 8. That they are worſe in their power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
than the Biſhops. Never ſuch a rule-leſſe, law-leſs,
controul-leſſe generation of men in this Nation. <hi>p</hi> 9. Such
<pb facs="tcp:52973:10"/>
as ſpread Snares and Temptations in the way of mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
<hi>Page</hi> 10. A generation of men that ſpread ſnares of
death, and lay ſtumbling blocks in their Brethrens way. <hi>And
Page</hi> 16. That uſe their power to the wringing and ſtraining of
mens Conſciences. <hi>Yet theſe are the men whom he before
owned as</hi> men of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>3. Men of worth. <hi>For all this page 5. he calls them</hi> an
inconſiderable number of men. <hi>Page</hi> 6. Such as diſgracefully
reject men, though never ſo worthy. <hi>Page 7. Such as uſe
indirect practiſes for ends and ſelf-advantage.</hi> That
Thieves and Murtherers may as ſoon (or ſooner) purchaſe
the Seal of their Approbation to any Benefice, <hi>as ſome others,</hi>
though never ſo ſignally qualified for the Miniſtry. <hi>P.</hi> 15. That
they uſe their power to revenge themſelves upon their enemies.
<hi>P.</hi> 16. That the day would fail him to inſiſt upon all their errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and irregular deportments. <hi>P.</hi> 22. That they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of any uſefulneſs in themſelves for the ſervice either of
God or man. <hi>That they are but like the</hi> Bramble in Jotham<hi>'s</hi>
Parable, <hi>meer Brambles in power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſinuating alſo, that
they</hi> are men of unchriſtian principles of immodeſt and
diſ-ingenuous Spirits. <hi>Page</hi> 23. Men of unhandſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed
doings in their way, ſuch as grant Paſs-ports to the
firſt-born of undeſerving men, but deny them to the deſerving.
<hi>Page</hi> 28. Engliſh Inquiſitors, ſirnamed Tryers. <hi>Page</hi> 25. Who
reſpect the vile many times more than the precious. <hi>Yet theſe
are the men whom profeſſingly he ſaid he beleeved to be</hi>
men of Worth.</p>
            <p>4. Men fearing God. <hi>Yet Page 2 and 3. Men who are</hi>
Lords and Maſters over other mens Faith and Conſciences.
<hi>Page</hi> 9. Men that exerciſe a bloody dominion over them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their conſciences. <hi>Men that frequently practiſe</hi> an
unchriſtian demeanour. <hi>Page</hi> 11. Men who reject ſuch as
God and Chriſt do recommend unto them. <hi>Page</hi> 15. Such as
are Papal in their power, principles, uſurpations, practiſes
and ſpirits. Treacherous and diſloyal. Makers and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of Parties and Factions to multiply diſciples to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and revenge themſelves upon their Enemies. <hi>Page</hi> 17.
Such who thruſt forth Loiterers into the Lords Vineyard.
<pb facs="tcp:52973:10"/>
               <hi>Pa.</hi> 22. Men who have conſumed and undone perſons of eminent
growth in all Chriſtian worth and excellency, and are like to
devour more. And that they ſell their brethren to poverty and
miſery. <hi>Page</hi> 23. Premoters of a Faction, and that it was none
otherwiſe <hi>from the very beginning, but that they would ſteer
that</hi> crooked Courſe which they have ſteered. <hi>Page</hi> 27. Men
of politick reaches, and ſubtil contrivances, for the bringing
about ſecular Projects, or by ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Page 29. Such</hi> as can
perſecute the innocent and harmleſs with a good conſcience.
<hi>Page 20, and</hi> 21. Brethren in Iniquity, Grinders of men; men
of ignorance and ambition, imbaſing other mens Conſciences.
<hi>Yet theſe very men whom in his virulent humor he thus
ſtigmatizeth in the Book, he in his Epiſtle (before the Fit
of paſſionate Phantſie was up) ſeating himſelf (as it were)
under the ſhadow of death, before the great Tribunal,
durſt not do otherwiſe, while a Fit of Conſcience was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, but give them their due Character,</hi> Men of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and worth, fearing God, Lovers of Truth. <hi>Pray ſee
now how the man and his humor and theſe things ſuit
together!</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Quàm bene conveniunt, &amp; in unâ ſede morentur!</l>
               <l>O <hi>Corydon, Corydon,</hi> quae te dementia cepit?</l>
            </q>
            <p>What ails the man, that he ſhould be thus poſſeſſed with
an Evil Spirit of Self-contradiction! So much for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,</hi>
though it be not one half of the Filth that he
vomited up againſt them. Now—</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>as in his</hi> Epiſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>he ſpeaks honor of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners;
ſo there alſo he</hi> profeſſeth all Chriſtian Loyalty,
and entireneſs of his Reſpects toward the Perſons by whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
the ſaid Commiſſions have iſſued, and been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
<hi>And yet before he hath done that very</hi> Epiſtle, <hi>he
cannot forbear ſlily intimating, that their two Ordinances
(which he otherwhere calleth Commiſſions) are</hi> Apocrythal
Statutes or Decrees to vex the Conſciences of good men in the
Nation. <hi>And to the end he may handle them roundly with
Authority, he in his</hi> Poſtſcript to the Reader, <hi>next after his</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52973:11"/>
Epiſtle, <hi>tells them in effect (as I have already ſhewn you)
that he hath a Commiſſion from Chriſt</hi> to ſmite them for
their miſ doings; <hi>which out of his great reſpect to them,
he executeth in his Book to ſome purpoſe againſt them.
As you may read Page 1. telling the</hi> Civil Powers, they
have put a great Indignity and Affront upon Jeſus Chriſt <hi>by
iſſuing out the ſaid Commiſſions or Ordinances. Page 2.
That thereby they have given the Commiſſioners</hi> an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
power to exerciſe dominion over the Faith and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of other men. <hi>Page</hi> 3. That they connive at the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.
<hi>Page</hi> 4. That they are deviſers of new Strategems,
Methods and Inventions to aid the Goſpel. <hi>Page 5. That the</hi>
two Commiſſions are Counter workers againſt the Orders and
Directions left by Chriſt. <hi>Page</hi> 6. That the Commiſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
upon the Spiritual Rights and Priviledges of Gods
People. <hi>And that they</hi> ſtrike (in effect) at the Civil Rights
of many Bodies of People, and particular perſons likewiſe in
the Land. <hi>Page 8. That our Governors have, in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commiſſioners,</hi> ſet up a lawleſs generation of men
over the Lords People; and that there never was the like
unſufferable yoke of ſlavery faſtened about the necks of the
free-born people here, as the power given to theſe Commiſſioners.
<hi>That they have therein</hi> done contrary both to Civil policie,
and Chriſtian piety. <hi>Alſo</hi> p. 11. contrary to Chriſtian policie;
<hi>and that</hi> when they were to chuſe perſons to be Commiſſioners,
they intruſted ſuch as (for the far greater part of them) are,
and were, by a true and ſolid eſtimate of them (in reſpect of
their Spirits, Principles, and Tenets) like to reject and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
ſuch men, whom Chriſt ſhould recommend to them for
Approbation. p. 14. <hi>That our Governors have</hi> erected the
Triers with power as ſuperlative, and of the ſame houſe and
linage with the Papal. And that they <hi>being the Founders,</hi>
do underhand indulge and connive at the Commiſſioners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
proceedings. <hi>p.</hi> 17. That they have an itching deſire
to be officious unto Chriſt; <hi>inſinuating withall, that they,</hi>
like other profeſſing Powers of the world, obtrude upon him
their own projections to help him through the world, &amp;c.
<hi>p.</hi> 19. That they have inveſted the Commiſſioners with power
<pb facs="tcp:52973:11"/>
to mould and form the Judgments and Conſciences of Fellow-Subjects
in matters of Faith. <hi>p. 20. That</hi> They connive at
the Commiſſioners, when they ſell their Brethren. <hi>p. 20,
&amp; 21. That</hi> They erected a Conſiſtory as bad as the
Spaniſh Inquiſition. <hi>And I know not what more: But
I am weary, and ſo I ſuppoſe is the Reader by this time, to
ſee a man ſo ſhamefully contradict himſelf over and over,
eſpecially if you compare his pretence of fair demeanour
towards Authority, with the language that he afterward
beſtows upon them as well as their Commiſſioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in concluſion, here now you have <hi>J. Goodwin</hi>
againſt <hi>J. Goodwin.</hi> proving himſelf to be of the ſame ſpirit

                  <q>IT is a great indignity and affront put upon the Lord

him, whether formally or conſtructively, with want
either of wiſdom and underſtanding, or of care and
faithfulneſs, in making ſufficient proviſion for the
due managing of his affairs, or for the propagation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Goſpel upon the beſt, and beſt-becoming
terms in the world. Now there being no Order or Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor any jot or tittle of either given by him to the Civil

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52973:14"/>
and over his ſervants, as that wherewith either Triers or
Ejectors, amongſt us, are inveſted by the ſaid Commiſſions
(reſpectively) They who notwithſtanding preſumed to
do it, I mean to make and eſtabliſh ſuch an erection in
the Church) what do they leſs then obliquely, yea and by
a pregnant and near-hand conſequence, impute either oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie
and forgetfulneſs, or elſe weakneſs and defect of
underſtanding unto the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in his own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt important affairs? If either the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
or any other on his behalf, will riſe up to plead or
ſhew an Order or Commiſſion from <hi>Chriſt</hi> for him to grant
ſuch Commiſſions and Authorities as thoſe now impleaded,
unto men, (beſides that it had been more Chriſtian and
proper that this ſhould have been done before the ſaid
Commiſſions had been iſſued, and exerciſed, to the great
ſcandal and offence of the far greater part of the godly and
underſtanding people in the Nation.) I fear that neither the
credit, nor the conſcience of the Undertaker will rejoice
over the enterpriſe, in as much as all attempts in this kind
that have been made (as many within the compaſs of a few
years laſt paſt have been) have miſcarried, and turned to
no account, but of loſs and diſparagement to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers.

this Pamphlet, it would have been known to be his by the
Air and Emptineſs, the boldneſs of Calumniating, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Miſtakes, Self contradictions, groundleſs Inſinuations,
vain Flaſhes, and the abuſing of honeſt-minded Readers, by
nauſeating them with Scandals, offered inſtead of Reaſons
and Arguments. And if theſe things be made to appear now
throughout the whole contexture of this Work of Darkneſs,
then the People of God, if they have not yet a full Diſcovery
of the Man and his Temper by his former Pieces, may here
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52973:14"/>
behold this <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren</hi> in his full Pourtraicture,
as he hath drawn himſelf to the Life with his own Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
the wicked Spirit of calumniation in this Diſcourſe
ſtanding (as it were) upon the cloven foot of two <hi>falſe
Suppoſitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Diſcourſe (ſuch as it is) conſiſteth of eighteen
ſeveral Heads, (as he hath made the Partition) though an
upright Heart, and a ſober Head not enclined to ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
would have been confined in a much narrower
compaſſe; and thoſe he calls <hi>Arguments and Grounds,
as well in Reaſon as Religion:</hi> but by the time that you
have ſeen with how much ſpleen and devotion he hath
ſacrificed both his Logick and Divinity to envie and
vain glory, in a few Rhetorical flouriſhes (the fruits of
an extravagant Phanſie) the World will finde but little
cauſe to admire him in point of Religion, much leſſe in
matter of Argumentation. Now to the Buſineſs; in
the handling whereof you will (perhaps) ſee cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
what he tells you in the Title-page, that he is an
<hi>Aged Miniſter,</hi> having indeed lived beyond the uſe of
that way of reaſoning, which he had when he was a
Boy in the Univerſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sum of this his firſt Argument may be reduced to
this Syllogiſm.</hi>—It is a great indignity put upon Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Goodwin's</hi> firſt Argument reduced into Form.</note>
to charge him either formally or conſtructively, with want
of care in making ſufficient proviſion for the propagation of
the Goſpel. <hi>But,</hi> there being no Order or Direction left
by Chriſt for erecting of ſuch an authority in the Church,
as that which is given to our Commiſſioners for approving
and ejecting, they who eſtabliſh ſuch an Erection, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively
and by conſequence, lay ſuch an imputation or
charge upon Christ, as if he had been careleſſe, and had not
ſufficiently provided for the propagation of the Goſpel; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
The Civil Powers in <hi>England,</hi> by erecting the Commiſſioners
for approving, and ejecting, have thereby put a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For Anſwer know,<note place="margin">The Anſwer.</note> That this Argument of Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
is grounded upon ſeveral <hi>falſe Suppoſitions</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52973:15"/>
being by him taken for granted, but not at all proved,
it is no other then a meer begging of the Queſtion:
For firſt,<note place="margin">Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Lord Ieſus Chriſt to make ſuch ample proviſion in his Goſpel,
by laying down Rules for the propagation thereof in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
that now there is nothing left for the Magiſtrate to
do, in point of prudence and diſcretion, for the promotion of
and advancement of it in the world:</hi> 2. He ſuppoſeth,
<hi>That the Commiſſioners for approving and ejecting are an
Authority constituted by his Highneſs and the Councel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His ſecond falſe Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                     <hi>in and over the Church.</hi> Theſe are the poor crutches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which this, and all the reſt of his eighteen Arguments
do halt. Take away theſe, all the reſt fail, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Pamphlet falls to the ground; therefore it
will not be amiſs to try how theſe will hold water, in
point of Religion and Reaſon. And hereunto it will be
neceſſary to requeſt the patience of the Reader a little
while, in order to his confutation, becauſe if he be
found faulty in the laying of his Foundation, it will be
an eaſie matter to bring the whole houſe down about his
ears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt Suppoſition before mentioned, upon which he
builds, is included in the</hi> Major Propoſition; <hi>and in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to that his</hi> falſe Suppoſal, <hi>let this</hi> Theſis <hi>be ſet down,

                     </note> Viz. That it was not the Intendment of our
bleſſed Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt to make ſuch ample
proviſion in the Goſpel, by laying down Rules for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
thereof, in all reſpects and particulars, and ſo to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
all occaſions, that now there is nothing left for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
to do, in point of prudence and diſcretion, for the
promoting and advancing of it in the World.</p>
                  <p>This youthfull piece of gravity hath lived ſo (like a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander)
the greateſt part of his dayes in the fire of
contention, that 'tis now become his moſt natural Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and having heretofore had ſome heats with Mr.
<hi>Pryn,</hi> who gives all to the Magiſtrate in Goſpel-affairs,
he cannot keep himſelf from the other extream of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52973:15"/>
all, and allowing the Magiſtrate nothing at all to do
therein; but thus it always happens, when a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
falleth into the hands of paſſionate men. And yet he
doth not expreſs himſelf with ſo much extravagancy, as
ſome others who are engaged with him in the ſame quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
among whom is one Mr <hi>Paſtlethwait,</hi> who in the
Preface to a Pamphlet of his Entituled, <hi>A Voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt the Tryers,</hi> hath made open Proclamation,
<hi>That we ought to accept no Lawgiver but Jeſus Chriſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Church or Common wealth, but that this ſhould be
our Profeſſion, the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
he is our King, &amp;c.</hi> Which being once admitted
in the ſame ſenſe, as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath inſinuated his own
wild Aſſertion, the Concluſion followeth as naturally from
this as from his; That therefore the Magiſtrate is not
at all concerned in the making of Civil Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
for the government of the Common-wealth;
which worthy Doctrine, in reference both to Church and
State, is in tranſcendent Terms, more Metaphyſically and
Hypertheologically expreſſed in another ſad Pamphlet, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>A Standard ſet up,</hi> lately written and publiſhed
in Order to the raiſing a bloody Rebellion in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
miſerably arrogating the Name of Chriſt and his
people to countenance the deſign, being ſubſcribed by
one <hi>William Medley,</hi> who jumps even in opinion with
Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> in all points (though he go a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
him in ſome) againſt the Authority of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and therefore Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> in ſuch Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
cannot chuſe but be a man of great credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
—But it is time I proceed to the proof of
my <hi>Theſis,</hi> the Reaſon whereof I propoſe as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</p>
                  <p>If it had been the intendment of Chriſt to do any ſuch
thing, as to leave Rules and Directions of ſo vaſt a latitude
and comprehenſion, as to take in and anſwer to all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Neceſſities, Occaſions, Contingencies and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Affairs, which might ariſe in the future in all Ages
and Nations of the World, concerning every prudent way

and means convenient for the promulgation of his Goſpel,
ſo that the Magiſtrate, and all other men, were to be tyed
up ſtrictly to the peremptory Obſervation of thoſe Rules,
without having recourſe (upon any emergencie) to the
Common principles of Natural Reaſon and Diſcretion, to
help on the work of propagating it among the Nations;
then doubtleſs the Eagles eye, and active pen of Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
would have ſpied them out, and tranſcribed a Copy of them
for us: But his autocratorical wiſdom is pleaſed either to
leave the Reader to take his word for the truth of it, or elſe
to go look where they may be found. Whereas the truth is,
if you make enquiry into the Precepts, and the Acts and
Monuments of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, upon the beſt
ſearch (certainly) no ſuch univerſal golden Rules and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
are yet diſcovered. For, while our Lord and Maſter
walked about clothed with the garment of his Incarnation,
we hear of no ſuch matter in the writings of the Evangeliſts;
and after his Reſurrection, in all the bleſſed Interviews and
Colloquies which he was pleaſed to have with his Friends
and Diſciples, there is not the leaſt mention of it; not at
the time of his Aſcenſion, when being ready to cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with the Robes of Glory and Immortality, he took
leave of his Apoſtles, and left them to carry on the work of
the everlaſting Goſpel, both among Jews and Gentiles:
Nor are there, after the time of his Glorification, any ſuch
Rules and Precepts to be ſeen in the Acts and proceedings
of the Apoſtles, of ſo various and univerſal an influence
and import, as in all points, upon all occaſions, in all
Countries, to ſerve to the great end before-mentioned.
Next to the great Act of ſuffering and Dying for the ſins
of Mankind, to reconcile Man to God, the ſpecial work of
Chriſt, to which he was deſigned by the Father, was, (as
himſelf hath declared, <hi>Luk. 4. 18.) To preach the Gospel to
the poor; to heal the broken-hearted; to preach deliverance to
the Captives; to recover ſight to the Blinde; to ſet at liberty
them that are bruiſed; to preach the acceptable year of the
Lord:</hi> That is to ſay, to reveal the way of life and ſalvation,
and to go about doing good to poor Sinners in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52973:16"/>
both of ſoul and body. The ſcope and purpoſe
of his taking Fleſh upon him, was to make publication of
the New Teſtament, and ſign and ſeal it with his blood:
But we find him not any where dictating Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
for the univerſal and perpetual Practice of men in the
communicating of it to ſucceeding Generations. The onely
Inſtitutions which were made immediately by himſelf, are
the great Ordinances of <hi>Preaching the Word,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper.</hi>
The <hi>Supper</hi> he inſtituted a little before his Death, and the
other he gave in Commiſſion to his Diſciples after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
when he commanded them to <hi>Go and teach all
Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe things which are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to the founding and conſtituting of a Church, he
took a particular care for; but as touching the means and
manner of publiſhing the Goſpel, and the way of planting
Churches, that (for ought that appears to the contrary in
Scripture) was wholly left to the management of the
Apoſtles, whom he promiſed to endue with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
ſpirit for ſo wonderfull and extraordinary a
work.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next place, it will be very requiſite to enquire
whether or no, in the Acts or Writings of the Apoſtles we
can find any kind of Canons, Decrees, or Conſtitutions
made by them, to be as ſtanding Rules, whereby men are
bound neceſſarily to frame and direct their deſigns, ſo as
by no means to uſe any other <hi>Mediums</hi> for the planting and
propagation of the Goſpel: Or, whether the Apoſtles have
left any Examples of their own practice upon Record, which
all men are obliged to follow, and not to recede a tittle
from them, in the ſame work of Goſpel-propagation: For
if ſo be that Chriſt neither immediately of himſelf, nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by his Apoſtles, eſtabliſhed ſuch obligatory Rules
and Directions (as are pretended to) excluſive of all other
means, by vertue of any Precept, or exemplary Practice;
then judge ye whether this bold Aſſertion of his be like to
hold right in concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt obſervable <hi>Medium</hi> that the Apoſtles made uſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52973:17"/>
of for the propagation of the Goſpel, and augmenting the
number of Converts and Profeſſors, was the exerciſing a
<hi>Community of Goods;</hi> ſo we may read, <hi>Act. 4. 34, 35. That
as many as were poſſeſſors of lands or houſes, ſold them, and
brought the prices of the things that were ſold, and laid them
down at the Apoſtles feet; and diſtribution was made unto
every man according as he had need.</hi> This is one Inſtance
of Apoſtolical practice and example; which no man that
knows the manner and condition of Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> will ſo
much as imagine 'tis his opinion, that this is one of the
Rules binding himſelf, or the Magiſtrate, or any other, to
obſerve in promoting the publication of the Goſpel. 'Tis
believed, neither the Credit, nor the Conſcience of the
Man, will rejoice in ſuch an Aſſertion; and therefore having
him herein (I dare ſay) <hi>confitentem reum,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Aſturam va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pich ſervat ſub pector ulpem.</note> 
                     <hi>Marſupio
conſulentem,</hi> it ſhall be preſſed upon him no further.</p>
                  <p>Another means that the Apoſtles made uſe of for the
ſpreading of the Goſpel, was that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Laying on
of hands,</hi> whereby the extraordinary Gifts of the Holy
Ghoſt were in thoſe days uſually conferred upon ſuch as
they converted to the Faith; and theſe again made uſe of it
in order to the converting of others; that men ſeeing thoſe
miraculous Gifts breaking forth in ſeveral Operations, and
being thereby convinced of that ſupernatural and mighty
power which then attended the miniſtration of the Goſpel,
might be brought in to the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and be
confirmed in it. But in all the Prints, and grave Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
hitherto publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> our great
<hi>Maſter of Sentences,</hi> we do not find that he hath concluded
us and all the World under the obſervance and imitation
of the Apoſtolical practice and example in this particular,
as abſolutely neceſſary for the work of Goſpel-propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And ſo I paſs it over at preſent, till it be known
how his Infallible ſelf will be pleaſed to paſs a Judgment in
the matter.</p>
                  <p>A third means that the Apoſtles made uſe of for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the Truth of the Goſpel, was, That when occaſion
of difference did ariſe among the Primitive Chriſtians,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52973:17"/>
touching Goſpel-affairs, to the hinderance of its progreſs;
they, to wit the Apoſtles and Elders, aſſembled together,
and by Decrees of their own made an authoritative poſitive
deciſion in the Caſe, and gave Laws to be obſerved by all
the Churches, as you may read, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And it's conceived
Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> never yet maintained, (but rather hath openly
avowed the contrary) that this Example of the Apoſtles is
to be received as a Rule univerſally binding all men in all
Ages to do the like, and to aſſume the ſame power of Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Determination, in the way of Synods or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
in order to the promoting of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the main obſervable Practices mentioned in the
Acts of the Apoſtles; and ſome other there were which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to things reputed of an indifferent nature, as the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or not eating of certain Meats, uſing or not uſing of
Circumciſion, and of divers Rites and Ceremonies of the
Moſaical Law, as you may read, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. which
ſometimes were admitted, ſometimes rejected, as may be
ſeen by <hi>Pauls</hi> circumciſing of <hi>Timothy,</hi> when as the ſame
<hi>Paul</hi> at another time was ſtiffly oppoſing and pleading
againſt the practice of Circumciſion. Now we ſuppoſe Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> will not ſay, That this kind of liberty ſo aſſumed
and practiſed, is one of the ſtanding Rules which he with
ſo much confidence commends unto the Reader, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
to be obſerved in the promoting of the Goſpel: And
therefore unleſs our Reveernd Author can produce ſome
other Examples and Practices of the Apoſtles, which yet
we have not ſeen, and with good evidence propound them
to the World as univerſally obligatory upon men to follow,
he will ſeem to be as a man beating the air, and that hath
made a noiſe to no purpoſe. For, the truth is, whereas in all
the Acts of the Apoſtles, other men can perceive no ſuch
Examples of theirs, from whence ſuch poſitive Rules as he
pretends to, are either directly, or by conſequence deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
ſo among all the Precepts of the Apoſtles contained
either in that Book, or in any of their Epiſtles, no Rules
will be found of ſo comprehenſive a nature, as to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in all particulars that may fall out, ſo as to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52973:18"/>
exclude all uſe of humane reaſon and diſcretion in the
Magiſtrate or any other, towards the advancing ſo good
a work.</p>
                  <p>As to the main concernments of Church-Oeconomie
and Adminiſtration, they are ſufficiently provided for by
the Precepts and Directions left by the Apoſtles in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
but as to Church-edification, and the gathering in
of Beleevers through the preaching of the Goſpel, by
employing and encouraging men to that work, there are
no Precepts by them recorded to Poſterity, but what make
in juſtification of thoſe two Commiſſions of <hi>Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Ejection.</hi> which were given out by his Highneſs
and the Councel; as will be made evident by and by,
when Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> comes to fall more directly upon the
Commiſſions, and thoſe reverend and worthy perſons that
are impowered by them. In the mean time, it is ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Reader, what to think of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> firſt <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi>
or <hi>Suppoſal,</hi> and whether he can imagine it was the
intendment of Chriſt, either immediatly of himſelf, or
mediatly by his Apoſtles to make ſuch large Proviſion,
either by way of Precept or Example, to be as ſtanding
Rules in perpetuity, utterly excluſive of the uſe and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of humane prudence, in order to the publication of
the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now to the ſecond <hi>falſe Hypotheſis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr Goodwin</hi> his ſecond Suppoſition refuſed.</note> or <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> upon
which the Argument is founded, and which is implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained in the <hi>Minor Propoſition,</hi> falſly ſuppoſing
and inſinuating, <hi>as if our Commiſſioners for Approving and
Ejecting were an Authority conſtituted by his Highneſs and
the Councel in and over the Church and People of Chriſt.</hi>
For Confutation of this, the onely way is to make enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into the nature of the Ordinances or Commiſſions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by the genuine ſcope and drift whereof it will be
certainly known of what kind they are, and what was the
Intent of our Governours in the eſtabliſhment of them,
that thereby they ſhould deſerve to be ſcandalized, and
ſo rudely handled by him, who would be thought a man
of Ingenie and moſt high Ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52973:18"/>
To this end, that the truth may be cleared, let both the
Ordinances ſpeak for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, that which he is pleaſed to call the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of <hi>Tryers,</hi> rightly entituled, <hi>An Ordinance appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Commiſſioners for approbation of Publick Preachers;</hi>
The true intent and main Scope of this Ordinance, is ſet
down in that part of it which here followeth:</p>
                  <p>WHereas for ſome time paſt-hitherto, there hath not
been any certain courſe eſtabliſhed for the ſupplying
vacant places with able and fit perſons to preach the Goſpel,
by reaſon whereof not only the Rights and Titles of Patrons
are prejudiced, but many weak, ſcandalous, Popiſh, and ill-affected
perſons have intruded themſelves, or been brought
in, to the great grief and trouble of the good People of this
Nation; for remedy and prevention whereof, Be it ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Highneſs the Lord Protector, by and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of his Council, that every perſon, who ſhall from and
after the five and twentieth day of <hi>March</hi> inſtant, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
nominated, choſen, or appointed to any Benefice (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
called a Benefice with Cure of Souls) or to preach any
Publick ſetled Lecture in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhall before he
be admitted into any ſuch Benefice, or Lecture, be judged and
approved, by the perſons hereafter named, to be a perſon for
the grace of God in him, his holy and unblameable converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as alſo for his knowledge and utterance, able and fit to
preach the Goſpel; And that after the ſaid five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
day of <hi>March,</hi> no perſon, but ſuch as ſhall upon ſuch
Approbation be admitted by the ſaid perſons, ſhall take any
publick Lecture, having a conſtant ſtipend legally annexed
and belonging thereunto, or take, or receive any ſuch Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
as aforeſaid, or the profits thereof: And be it further
Ordained, That <hi>Francis Rous <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Dr Tho. Goodwin,</hi> &amp;c.
ſhall be, and are hereby nominated, conſtituted and appointed
Commiſſioners for ſuch Approbation and admiſſion as is above
ſaid, and upon death, or removal of any of them, others ſhall from
time to time be nominated in their places by the L. Protector
and his Succeſſors, by advice of his Councel, in the Interval of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52973:19"/>
Parliament; and ſitting the Parliament, by the Protector
and Parliament. And the ſaid Commiſſioners or any five
or more of them, met together in ſome certain place in the
City of <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as his Highneſs ſhall appoint,
are hereby authorized to judge and take knowledge of the
ability and fitneſs of any perſon ſo preſented, nominated, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
or appointed, according to the qualification above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and upon their approbation of ſuch his ability and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to grant unto ſuch perſon admiſſion to ſuch Benefice
or Lecture, by an Inſtrument in Writing under a Common
Seal to be appointed by his Highneſs, and under the hand of
the Regiſter or Regiſters for the time being, to be alſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by the Lord Protector and his Succeſſors, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſaid Regiſter or Regiſters ſhall cauſe to be entred
in a Book for that purpoſe, and kept upon Record.</p>
                  <p>And it is hereby Declared, That the ſaid perſon ſo admitted
into any ſuch Benefice, ſhall be Poſſeſſor and Incumbent of the
ſame, and intitled thereby to the Profits, Perquiſits, and all
Rights and Dues incident and belonging thereunto, as fully and
effectually, as if he had been Inſtituted and Inducted according
to the Laws of this Realm; as alſo the perſon that ſhall be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to any Lecture as aforeſaid, ſhall be thereby enabled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Eſtabliſhment and Conſtitution of ſuch Lecture,
to preach therein, and to have and receive the ſtipend or Profits
to ſuch Lecture belonging.</p>
                  <p>Provided alwayes, That no perſon who ſhall tender
himſelf, or be tendred, for approbation as aforeſaid, ſhall be
concluded by any Vote of the ſaid Commiſſioners, which
ſhall paſs in the Negative, as to his Approbation, unleſs
Nine or more of the ſaid Commiſſioners be preſent at ſuch Vote.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Ordinance Concludes thus.</hi> [And it is hereby
laſtly declared and ordained, that the Approbation or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
aforeſaid, in ſuch manner as is before preſcribed, is
not intended, nor ſhall be conſtrued, to be any ſolemn or ſacred
ſetting apart of a perſon to any particular office in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but onely by ſuch Tryal and Approbation to take care,
that places deſtitute may be ſupplyed with able and faithfull
Preachers throughout this Nation; And that ſuch fit and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

proved perſons faithfully labouring in the work of the Goſpel,
may be in a Capacity to receive ſuch publick ſtipend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as is or ſhall be allotted to ſuch places.]</p>
                  <p>The other is that which he cals the <hi>Commiſſion of Ejectors;</hi>
rightly Entituled <hi>An Ordinance for the Ejecting of Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
Ignorant, and Inſufficient Miniſters and Schoolmaſters;</hi>
the main whereof is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>WHereas by the continuance of divers ſcandalous and
inſufficient Miniſters and Schoolmaſters, in many
Churches, Chappels, and Publick Schools within this Nation,
the more effectual propagation of the Goſpel, and ſettlement of a
godly and painful Miniſtry is much obſtructed, and no authority
now in force for removing ſuch Miniſters and Schoolmaſters;
For remedy therof, Be it ordained by his Highneſs the Lord

What I have here inſerted, gives you the very ſum and
ſubſtance of the two-Ordinances, ſo far as concerns the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
Power of <hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Ejection;</hi> and though the
bare Reading of the Ordinances may be ſufficient to ſatisfie
any ingenuous man, ſo as to wipe off that ſcandalous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which, by way of falſe ſuppoſition, and peeviſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation,
hath been darted at the ſupreme Magiſtrate, and
the perſons next him in Authority, in reference to the
power by them granted in the ſaid Ordinances; yet it will
not be amiſs a little to animadvert upon each particular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as touching the <hi>Ordinance for Approbation;</hi> how can
it be ſaid to conſtitute an Authority in and over the
Church, ſeeing if the Authority therein given, were ſuch
as he pretens, then it muſt be an Authority exerciſing
either Legiſlation in making Decrees and Conſtitutions for
the odering of Church-affairs, or Juriſdiction in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Church-Cenſures? But certainly, neither hath his
Highneſs given, nor the Commiſſioners themſelves ever
conceived they have, nor can any rational man infer
they have, from the Contents of the Ordinance, a faculty
of exerciſing Power in matter of <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> or Juriſdiction
within, or over the Church in general, or any particular
Congregation; and therefore certainly no man that is not
ſworn to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, will conclude, that they are
conſtituted (or can in the leaſt meaſure be reputed) an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in and over the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That high and heavenly Ordinance of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word, the due promotion whereof is the ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
ſcope of the Ordinance of his Highneſs, was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
intended by Chriſt for the inſtructing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
of ſuch as were, and are without the Pale of the
Church, and for the gathering of them into Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
in the next place, for the edifying and building
of them up after they are gathered in. Now the intent of
his Highneſs and the Council was not at all, that by vertue
of this Ordinance any ſhould take cogniſance of the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Paſtors or Preachers in private gathered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
or Churches, (who, it is known, notwithſtanding
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52973:21"/>
this Ordinance, remain as much at liberty as before;) but
they are <hi>Publick Preachers,</hi> that is, ſuch as have, or would
have a Publick State-maintenance (be it either in the way
of a Benefice, or Lecture) legally annexed to the places
where they preach, or otherwiſe publickly allowed, (theſe
are they) that fall within the reach of this Ordinance.
I ſuppoſe it would not well ſuit with Mr. <hi>Goodwin's</hi> principle
and way, to ſay that ſuch Beneficed men and Lecturers,
ſtanding upon a Publick Account, and their reſpective Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
or Pariſhes, are (in his opinion) rightly conſtituted
Churches. And if ſo, how then will this profound man of
Science be able (on his part) to make good, in reaſon or
conſcience, that the Magiſtrates authoriſing perſons with
a power of Trying ſuch men whether they be qualified for
the employment of preaching in Pariſhes, can be ſaid to be
the erecting of a Power in and over the Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though it would be beſide the preſent buſineſs
to ſtart that Controverſie, whether, or how far the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
may intermeddle in matters of Religion; yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
'tis fit to conſider, that the ſame thing may be a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon a Magiſtrate, being a Chriſtian, as really as
it is a duty upon inferior perſons who are Chriſtians. Now
if it be the duty of every Chriſtian man, in his ſphere, as
much as in him lieth, to advance the propagation of the
Goſpel where-ever he hath an opportunity, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,
or by procuring the communication of it to others,
(which it's ſuppoſed neither Mr. <hi>G.</hi> nor any elſe will deny)
then undoubtedly the Supreme Magiſtrate of <hi>England,</hi> being
a Chriſtian Profeſſor, by continuing that Publick way of
Maintenance, which the Laws of the Land, and the Bounty
of the State have allowed, to ſupport and encourage the
Publick Preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, and thereupon by exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Magiſtratical authority, in transferring it by way of
Truſt into the hands of certain perſons whom he ſees cauſe
to confide in as Commiſſioners under him, for the Proving
and Trying of men, whether they be fit to be owned upon
the Publick Account, in order to ſo high an employment as
Preaching to the People, hath therein done his duty, and in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52973:21"/>
ſo doing kept within his ſphere as a Magiſtrate, and is ſo
far from intrenching thereby upon the Church, or Churches
(take which you will) in any kind, that there is rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
cauſe for the Churches of Chriſt to bleſs God for
the care taken, than to find fault; and to hope, that by this
means the number of Believers will be exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and the Lord be pleaſed to add to the Church
daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved. All that the Magiſtrate hath
done here by ſuch an Ordinance, is an Act only of State,
a meer Civil Conſtitution, and by vertue thereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
not exerciſing any power of Legiſlation or
Juriſdiction for the ordering and governing of Churches,
but only a power of Trial and Inſpection concerning ſuch
men, whom the Magiſtrate is to ſend abroad to publiſh the
Goſpel, that the people may become fit matter for Churches:
Therefore the ſaid Commiſſioners muſt of neceſſity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
only Officers of the Commonwealth in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and not an Authority eſtabliſhed (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> would have
it) in and over the Church.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Ordinance for Approbation</hi> is in Truth, no more
then that other Ordinance of his Highneſs, whereby cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
perſons are commiſſionated under him as <hi>Truſtees for
the maintenance of Miniſters;</hi> that is, for ſetling of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
for the better maintenance of Miniſters in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where the means is but ſmall. As this Ordinance is
to be reputed a meer Civil Act in reſpect of its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
ſo alſo muſt the other; for the ſame hand framed
the one which did the other; and being both deſigned for
the ſame end, <hi>Viz.</hi> The due diſtribution of that publick
Maintenance which is allowed by the Magiſtrate, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſuch Directions as he hath preſcribed, they muſt
needs both in reſpect of their Original, the regulation
of their exerciſe, and their end, be eſteemed no other then
Acts of the ſame nature and conſtitution, both alike flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the ſame fountain of Civil power to the ſame
purpoſe: And yet Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not one Tittle to ſay
againſt that Ordinance, or Commiſſion of the ſaid <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees,</hi>
though in the execution thereof, it comes as neer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52973:22"/>
his Church-door as the other. But all the ſpight is it
ſeems at the <hi>Commiſſioners for Approbation;</hi> the reaſon
whereof will be better underſtood anon, when I come
to fall upon ſome of his following Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as concerning the Ordinance for <hi>Ejection,</hi>
it is alſo (as appears in the ſeverall parts of it) a meer
Civill conſtitution. For (you ſee) that Ordinance doth
uot inable the Commiſſioners to exerciſe the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
given, over any perſons whatſoever employed in the
work of the Goſpel, ſave only ſuch who are publick
Preachers, Lecturers, or other perſons formerly called Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Vicars, or Curats, enjoying thoſe. Benefices formerly
called Benefices with Cure of Souls, or that are ſetled
in publick Lectures, having any Stipends or Salaries le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
annexed or belonging thereunto. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
the Magiſtrate herein gives a power to animadvert
upon no other perſons, but thoſe onely who are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by himſelf to the imployment of publick preaching,
and upon that account have a maintenance derived to them
from himſelf, and the Law of the Land, who as they
have their riſe, and their Miſſion from the Civil Power,
ſo they have their dependency upon it, and in this reſpect
can be reputed no other then perſons publikely imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Common-wealth, on the behalf of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
to divulge the Doctrine of the Goſpel, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
aſſemblies of the people; who if they be found either
ſcandalous in life, or through Ignorance inſufficient for
the work; ſurely then the Magiſtrate who alloweth and
ſecureth them their Wages by Law, muſt needs look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as his duty to ſee them turned out of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
as he is concerned to do in the like caſe of any
other perſons whatſoever imployed in a publick relation
to, and dependency upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being ſo, the Reader is left to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be not more of vanity, then either Reaſon
or Religion in Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> firſt Argument, ſince in the
ſifting of it, there is nothing to be found, but the chaffe
of two <hi>falſe Suppoſitions;</hi> upon which he hath built and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52973:22"/>
flouriſhed up the whole ſtructure of his ſlight Pamphlet.
For, it being manifeſt that neither Chriſt nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
left any ſuch Rules in pepetuity to promote the
Preaching of the Goſpel, as to anſwer all future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
occaſions in order thereunto, or to exclude the
Magiſtrate from contributing his aſſiſtance, either in the
way of Countenance or Prudence, for the publication
thereof; And it being clear likewiſe, from the very
ſcope and intendment of the Ordinances themſelves,
which have been ſo injuriouſly impeached, that they
are onely Acts of a meer Civil nature, inveſting men
with power upon a Publick Civil Account, we muſt needs
come to this Concluſion, in opoſition both to the <hi>major</hi>
and <hi>minor</hi> Propoſitions of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> That as it was not the
intent of Chriſt or his Apoſtles to make ſo large provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
by Rules, in all minute Particulars, for publiſhing
the Goſpel, as to exclude the Magiſtrate from doing
what is fit in a way of Reaſon and Prudence, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
ſo good a work among the People; And that
as it was not the intent of his Highneſs and the Council
by their Ordinances to intermedle with Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but onely to have the Word univerſally preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by pious and able men, for the Peoples inſtruction:
So, by erecting the Commiſſioners for <hi>Approbation</hi> and
<hi>Ejection,</hi> they have been far from a conſtructive charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt with want of care in not leaving ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Directions to progagate the Goſpel (ſeeing to leave
Rules of ſo univerſal an extent, and excluſive a nature
as is pretended, was no part of his intendment;) nor
can they be ſaid to have eſtabliſhed any Authority in
and over the Church, (as is by him moſt cauſeleſly
inſinuated) and conſequently they have not put any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
thereby at all upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

the faithfulneſs of men legally entruſted with ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
yea and their own ſignal worths and miniſterial

Chriſt</hi> never took upon him the exerciſe of any ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as to appoint a few men for the deveſting of any
ſort of men whatſoever, much leſs the Miniſters of his
Goſpel, of their temporal rights or enjoyment, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their faith in matters appertaining unto God, is
not the ſame in all points with the ſaith of other men.</p>
                     <p>If it be replied, that neither ſort of Commiſſioners,
Triers or Ejectors, are impowred by the tenor or words
of their Commiſſions, to puniſh any Miniſter, either <hi>poenâ
ſenſus,</hi> or <hi>poenâ damni,</hi> ſimply for not beleeving, or (which
is the ſame in effect) for not profeſſing, or not teaching
others to beleeve as themſelves beleeve; ſo that when
they do any ſuch thing as this, they act beſides their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
I anſwer, firſt, The Commiſſioners themſelves, at
leaſt ſuch of them as are generally known to underſtand
their Commiſſions, as well as, or rather better then their
fellows, do ſo conſtrue and underſtand them, as giving
them power both to reject, and eject for not finding their

Their frequent, if not conſtant practice in this

not approved of by thoſe under whoſe authority and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
they thus practice, clearly ſheweth that the ſenſe
intended, or at preſent owned in both the Commiſſions

ought to be men of Judgment, I ſhall not deny; but that
(like Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>) they ſhould have an opinion of their
own Infallibility, or of neceſſity be indeed Infallible, before
they undertake ſuch a work, ſure there is no need. Their
Commiſſion (the Ordinance) impowers them to paſs their
Judgments concerning men, by approving, or not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
them for the work of Preaching, according as they
have cauſe to believe them duly qualified, or not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for it, in reference to theſe three particulars, <hi>viz.
The Grace of God in them; Their holy and unblameable,
Converſation; Their Knowledge and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance.</hi> What
need any Infallible Spirit be required in men to paſs a
Judgment upon other men in theſe Reſpects, before they
be ſent out to Preach? That which was the Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was written doubtleſs for our inſtruction

                     <hi>The things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou haſt heard of
me, the ſame commit thou to faithful men, who ſhall teach others
alſo.</hi> By which Text it appeareth, 1. That men ought to
be tryed and approved before they be ſent to preach the
Doctrine of the Goſpel. And, 2. That the proving of
their Grace and Faithfulneſs doth not preſuppoſe there
ought to be an Infallibility in the perſons who are to prove
and approve them; becauſe this proving and approving of
the Graces of men that were to be imployed in any work
of the Goſpel, was to be a thing of ordinary and continual
practice, as is cleer by that of the Apoſtle before cited, it
being a Rule of Direction now to ſucceeding Times and
perſons,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 10.</note> upon occaſion, as well as then to <hi>Timothy.</hi> And
by that of the Apoſtle in another place, where he ſpeaks of
the proving and approving of a Deacon, and ſaith, That
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52973:24"/>
before their Approbation, they muſt be proved whether
<hi>they hold the myſterie of the Faith in a pure Conſcience;</hi> and
then they may uſe the Employment. Which is no other
then a cleer Evidence of the lawfulneſs of the proving and
approving of men in point of Grace, before they be ſent
about Goſpel-work: And it being a Rule for conſtant
practice, it carrieth moreover along with it as cleer an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation,
that there is no ſuch need of a Spirit of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
before men can be fit to act in the way of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
in reſpect of the Graces of men. And as to the other
Qualifications, <hi>viz. Holineſs and unblameableneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
with Knowledge and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance;</hi> theſe two Points
are cognoſcible <hi>in Foro externo,</hi> by enquiry into mens Lives,
and by examination of their Parts, and their experiences
of Gods dealing with them in the work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſuppoſeth, That his Highneſs and the
Council have by the Ordinances impowered the Commiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
<hi>to exerciſe dominion over the Faith, Judgments, and
Conſciences of men.</hi> To prove this, he ſaith, The <hi>Commiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners

they cannot in conſcience profeſs and believe as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners

account diſapprove men, <hi>and ſhut them out from ſuch places
of livelihood, to which they are called by Patrons, and fitted by
their own ſignal worths and abilities.</hi> For Anſwer, know,
It is no wonder that he who dares faſten ſo ill and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
an Imputation upon our Governors, as that they have
impower'd perſons to exerciſe an unchriſtian dominion
over mens Faith, whenas there is not a tittle in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of any ſuch matter to be found (it is no wonder,
I ſay, that he who preſumes to prevaricate ſo unconſcion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
againſt them) ſhould under a pretence of making
good the ſcandal which he caſts upon them (to ſhew his
emptineſs of proof) fall to calumniating of thoſe who are
the Commiſſioners under them, by raiſing an ill report upon
their proceedings. But this hath been his uſual way of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52973:25"/>
Argumentation, <hi>fortiter calumniari,</hi> upon other occaſions,
and to obſerve neither Rule in Ratiocination, nor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> to make out an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe, whoever looks into the two Ordinances for
<hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Ejection,</hi> will find that the Commiſſioners
have their work ſet forth to them by the preſent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
with Rules whereby they are to proceed, and how to
behave themſelves, as Servants uſe to have when they are
imployed by their Maſters, ſo that it appears to be a point of
Service, rather then of Lordſhip or dominion, wherein the
Commiſſioners are exerciſed. It may with as much reaſon
be ſaid, when a perſon offers himſelf to be a Member of a
Congregation, and to partake of the Lords Supper, that
the trying and examining of him in this caſe whether he be
fit and worthy, is the exerciſing of a dominion and lordſhip
over him. Then, whereas he ſaith, they exerciſe <hi>Dominion
over the Iudgments and Faith of all the Miniſters of the
Gospel;</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>1. That as it is not a Dominion, ſo neither do they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
it over all the Miniſters of the Nation: Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
can (if he pleaſe) confute himſelf in this; For, I ſurpoſe he
believeth himſelf to be a Miniſter, and yet he knoweth
neither of the Commiſſions have been exerciſed over him.
Alas, he was ejected out of his Pariſh-Living in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet</hi>
by a Committee of Parliament; but that was before
the eldeſt of theſe Commiſſions was born.</p>
                  <p>2. That it is not over all the Miniſters of the Goſpel,
becauſe 'tis evident by the very letter of the Commiſſions,
that they are not impowered to meddle one way or other
with the Miniſters or Paſtors of <hi>Gather'd Congregations,</hi> but
only with ſuch as ſeek, or do enjoy the Publick Maintenance
of the State to ſupport them in the Miniſtry. And this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
afterwards confeſſeth in expreſs terms in his 5. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where he ſtileth them Miniſters of <hi>Parochial Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;</hi>
though here, to the end that this crazie Argument
might run the more roundly, he thought fit to let it paſs on
in general Terms, by omitting the due Diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52973:25"/>
3. That it is not over Miniſters <hi>quatenus</hi> Miniſters, as
they were taken heretofore under the notion and quality
of a Sacred Function, but only as they ſtand in relation to
the Magiſtrate, a Publick Miniſtry upon the Account of a
Legal Publick Maintenance; and ſo the Judgment that is
paſſed in the approving and diſapproving, or in the ejecting
of them by vertue of thoſe Commiſſions, is only in reſpect
of their being perſons fit or unfit to receive or enjoy that
Maintenance, and cannot be called a Judgment over their
Faith, which they are left to enjoy at their own liberty as
much as before; which being allowed them, it is fit the
Magiſtrate ſhould enjoy his liberty alſo, to refuſe them his
Maintenance, if their Faith and Perſwaſions be ſuch, as he
cannot in conſcience believe he ought to give countenance
and ſupport unto. Moreover, whereas he ſaith, that thoſe
Miniſters, by vertue of the Ordinance for Ejecting, <hi>are
put out of the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of ſuch Livelihoods,
which the Laws of the Land have entituled them unto, to the
affamiſhing of themſelves, their wives and children, becauſe
they cannot believe as the Commiſſioners require them, upon
the ſaid penalty, to believe:</hi> The Anſwer to this is evident
(as before;)</p>
                  <p>1. That the Commiſſioners do not eject them, becauſe
not of the ſame Judgment with themſelves in matters of
Faith, but becauſe their Judgment and Opinions are ſuch
as come within the compaſs of thoſe Tenets and Doctrines,
which the Magiſtrate hath declared he in Conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
and will not give Maintenance unto. Beſides, the
power of ejecting is not exerciſed upon men only becauſe
of their Opinions, but it reſpects alſo the looſe and ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
and converſation of ſuch as are imployed in the
work of Publick Preaching.</p>
                  <p>2. That any power which conferreth a livelihood on
any perſon upon certain conditions, to a certain end,
ought in all reaſon to have a right of reſuming that live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
in caſe neither the conditions be obſerved, nor the
end of the Collation be anſwered, while the party conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
in poſſeſſion of the ſaid Livelihood. Now it was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52973:26"/>
the Magiſtrate and the Law which conferred livelihoods
upon the Miniſters before-mentioned: The Conditions
whereupon they were conferred, were that they ſhould
behave themſelves in all things as becomes Miniſters;
the end was, that they ſhould with diligence and ſound
Doctrine feed and inſtruct the people under their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
charges. Therefore in caſe thoſe Miniſters do
not perform the conditions on their part, but run out
into any of the licentious and diſorderly practiſes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of behaviour enumerated in the Ordinance; and ſhall
happen to make ſhipwrack of the Faith, by corrupting
the truths of God with falſe Doctrine, or be ignorant
themſelves, ſo that the end (which was that they ſhould
inſtruct the people with ſound knowledge) is not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
certainly the Magiſtrate in this Caſe may righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(and is queſtionleſs bound in Conſcience to) reſume their
livelihoods into his own hand, and diſpoſe of them to
others, who he conceiveth will better perform the end for
which thoſe livelihoods and livings were firſt by Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
And though the wants and neceſſities to which
themſelves and theirs may be reduced to, upon their being
ejected, be a matter of Commiſeration, yet it holds not
water in point of Reaſon, to prove that they ought to be
kept in, rather then there ſhould be a Commiſſion to eject
them, unleſſe Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> (after his wonted way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
will judge it more reaſonable, that the great end of
the Goſpel-miniſtration ſhould be loſt, and the ſouls of the
people (without any commiſeration) be either ſtarved for
want of ſound Doctrine, or poyſoned with falſe, rather
than the falſe, ignorant, inſufficient, or ſcandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

If this Argument were of any weight, then no man ought
to be put out of his Office or Imployment in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

telling us, <hi>That doubtleſs Chriſt never took upon
himſelf any ſuch authority as to appoint a few men to deveſt
any men, much leſſe Miniſters of their rights, becauſe their
faith in matters appertaining to God, is not the ſame with

to the deveſting any men of their rights, becauſe they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not aright; but what is this to the purpoſe? Will he
infer from hence? <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Magiſtrate doth ill, becauſe
he requires thoſe who are Officers or Commiſſioners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him upon a publick and civill account, not to permit
thoſe perſons to enjoy the publick maintenance, who in
matters of Faith do <hi>hold</hi>

hold, teach, or maintain any of thoſe Popiſh Opinions, which
by the Oath of Abjuration (mentioned in an Ordinance of

Will he infer likewiſe? <hi>ERGO,</hi> The Commiſſioners who
put this part of their Commiſſion in execution, do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Dominion over the Faith and Conſciences of men.
Laſtly, will he infer, <hi>ERGO,</hi> rather then ſeem to do ſo,
both the Magiſtrate and theſe Commiſſioners who act
under him, are bound to maintain the men in the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their Execrable, Blaſphemous, and Popiſh Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in matters of Faith, rather than withdraw the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

them to have the ſaid Maintenance, or by withdrawing it
from them, they (according to the invidious ſenſe of

the rare Inferences that muſt unavoidably be drawn (for

varying the Phraſe of what he (in effect) ſaid before
in his firſt Argument, and grounded upon the ſame <hi>Petitio
Principii,</hi> a begging of the Queſtion, which we muſt by
no means admit, ſeeing I ſuppoſe we have already made it
evident, as a matter out of queſtion; That it was not the
intendment of Chriſt to leave (nor did he or his Apoſtles
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52973:27"/>
leave) any Rules and Directions of ſuch a nature, of ſo
univerſal an extent, variety, and Influence (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
would inſinuate he did) as that they will ſerve in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
for the publication of the Goſpel, and do poſitively
exclude the Magiſtrate from doing any thing at all that is
conducible thereunto; which indeed, as thus ſtated, is the

old as to account what hath been almoſt from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to be unto your gravity and long ſtanding in the

in all Times, that a man ſhould not be admitted to an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment

it be a new thing now to make a Trial and Judgement of

both in the old and new Teſtament. Beſides, you your ſelf
do tell us in you eighth Argument, that the Trying of men
thus is as old as Epiſcopacy, and yet now it muſt be a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty;
that is no rare matter for you to contradict your

ſo ordered; that it was exerciſed by the ſame perſons

by this time Mr <hi>G.</hi> is ready to retract, and acknowledge his
error, for ſaying that the practice of Trying and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

he pleaſe a little to look upward, he will finde it as old as
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus, &amp;c.</hi> So far is it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Novelty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> whereas he ſaith, <hi>Thoſe who deviſe means to aid
the Gospel, and prevent Inconveniences incident to it, beyond
or beſide what Christ hath preſcribed and directed, do in effect
deny him to be as faithful to God the Father, as</hi> Moſes <hi>was:</hi>
For Anſwer to this, obſerve, That the great ſtreſs of his
Allegation lieth in the particle [<hi>As,</hi>] by vertue hereof
ſuppoſing, that if Chriſt were as faithful as <hi>Moſes,</hi> then he
left as full and cleer Directions for the work of the Goſpel
in all points, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did for the Law. But this cannot be
the meaning of the place. For, in the 14. verſe of the ſecond
Chapter, he is ſaid to be a faithful <hi>High Prieſt</hi> in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.
1. <hi>In things pertaining to God,</hi> having approved
himſelf faithful in revealing the Doctrine of the Goſpel,
according to the mind of him that ſent him, (For, that was
one part of his Commiſſion, as you may read <hi>Luc. 4. 18.)
2. In that he made Reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi>
And ſo in theſe two regards he was faithful both as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and a Prieſt, or as an Apoſtle and Prieſt, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
a little after in the firſt verſe of the third Chapter;
where we are bidden to conſider his faithfulneſs in both
thoſe Capacities, who (as it followeth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.) was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52973:28"/>
to him that appointed him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the onely Inference that can be made from the place
is this, That as <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful to God in what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him to, ſo alſo was Chriſt. God the Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Chriſt as the great Prophet or Apoſtle of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
to preach the minde of God in the doctrine of the
Goſpel; that was one end of his miſſion: And he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him as our High-Prieſt, to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice to
make an Atonement or Reconciliation for the ſins of the
people. Which two particulars being the ends of Gods
appointing him, and he having fulfilled them according to
the appointment, is in this reſpect ſaid to be faithful as
<hi>Moſes</hi> was; not becauſe he had done things in all reſpects
to anſwer the things done by <hi>Moſes;</hi> for, then he would
have left us ſuch Rules and Directions at large (which we
cannot yet ſee) upon Record, as Mr. <hi>G</hi> ſaith he hath
done, for the Politie or Oeconomie of the Church, and as
fully and compleatly ſet down in writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Moſes</hi> left his;
but the genuine meaning of the place muſt be undeniably
this, That he was faithful in all things as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, becauſe
he publiſhed the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and ſealed it with
his blood for the expiation of ſin, and therein did what he
was appointed to, as faithfully as <hi>Moſes</hi> formerly did what
he was appointed to by God. The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Equiparation of
the faithfulneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place, reſpecteth
only the reality and exactneſs of their performance, both
of them having alike punctually performed the ſeveral Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
made to them by God; but it doth not infer
that there was, or ought to have been a ſimilitude, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency,
or congruity in the whole manner, extent and
fabrick of their Inſtitutions. For, to the end of the world,
let Mr. <hi>G.</hi> do what he can with the Scripture, let him wring
it by the noſe, to turn it which way he pleaſe, as the Papiſts
do, or to force blood out of it, as too many in our times do,
yet he will never be able to make this Text to ſerve his
purpoſe: Beſides, even in common ſenſe it is manifeſt to
any that is but the leaſt acquainted with the Goſpel, that
our Lord and Saviour hath not by poſitive Laws deſcended
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52973:29"/>
ſo far into particularities with us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did with the
people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And ſo you ſee what is become of the
Third Argument, grounded upon a miſunderſtanding of
that part of the Scripture concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi>
We might be far more copious; but this is too much for
him.</p>

out, and (in our Saviours phraſe) make of none effect
ſome or other of thoſe precepts or directions, which have
been given by the Lord Chriſt himſelf, for the ſame end.
Even as the Pope cannot gratifie any new Saint with a
day in the Kalendar, but only either by turning ſome of
the more antient out of their long-continued poſſeſſions,
or elſe by compelling them to take the other into part and
fellowſhip with them in their honor, becauſe the Kalendar
is from the one end of it to the other already filled with
the Names of the more antient: In like manner the whole
latitude and compaſs of wiſdom and prudence for the due
and ſucceſsfull managing of the affairs of the Goſpel,
being ſpread with the orders and charges given by <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> in that behalf, it is not poſſible for men to deviſe
or ſet on foot any method, means, or device of theirs for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52973:29"/>
the promoting of this end, but by diſauthorizing, or with
reflection of diſparagement upon ſome or other, or all,

any man to invent or form any projection, or make any
proviſion, which upon a true account will be found in

Howbeit, becauſe he ſeems to lay ſome weight upon theſe
words, [<hi>In all the houſe of God</hi>] ſome Reply muſt be

<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> is here meant the Church of
God univerſal, as will appear by comparing it with
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. where the <hi>houſe of God,</hi> is plainly called,
<hi>the Church of the living God.</hi> Now it is not to be denied,
but that Chriſt took care with as much faithfulneſs, as
<hi>Moſes</hi> did for the ordering of all this Houſe of God. For,
whatſoever was neceſſary for the founding, building;
and ordering of this Houſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Church univerſal,
he very faithfully provided. He laid the foundation of
it upon the Prophets and Apoſtles, theſe latter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>viz</hi> the
Apoſtles, ſeconding that Doctrine of the Goſpel, which
had been firſt publiſhed by the Prophets. Moreover, for the
planting and building up of the Houſe of God, it is ſaid,
<hi>That he ſet in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets,
thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles, then Gifts of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
diverſity of Tongues.</hi> Laſtly, for the ordering of
this Houſe of his, he left the great Ordinances and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of <hi>Preaching the Word, Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi>
which Things we ought to ſuppoſe are all that Chriſt was
appointed to do, in reference to the ordering of the Church,
ſeeing we read of no more, and therefore having fulfilled
the appointment of God therein, we ought to beleeve him
as faithfull in his houſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in his, becauſe he
omitted nothing for the eſtabliſhment of it, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought neceſſary for him to do in his own perſon. As
for other things, which were neceſſary to be made uſe of in
after-time, for the gathering and ordering of particular
Churches, in divers Cities, Towns, or Countries, he left
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52973:30"/>
them to the ordering of his Apoſtles, to whom, before his
Aſcenſion, he gave a promiſe of the Spirit, for their Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Aſſiſtance, which after his Aſcenſion was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for, when he aſcended up on high, he gave Gifts unto
men to that end and purpoſe; and therefore he was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in all his Houſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in his, though he and his
Apoſtles left not Rules and Direction, at ſuch a Latitude,
as to anſwer ſo many particularities of Affairs and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as <hi>Moſes</hi> did. Nor indeed was there the ſame Reaſon for
it; for, if it may be lawfull to gueſs at the ground of
Gods proceeding thus in this particular, who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts
all things according to the beſt and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
dictates and proportions of wiſedom, there appears
to be a great deal of Reaſon, why Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
having left ſuch Inſtitutions, Rules, and Directions, which
are foundational, and abſolutely neceſſary for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
of the Church in general, ſhould not deſcend
to the inferiour points of Regulation touching particular
Churches, ſo as to leave Rules for it as amply as <hi>Moſes</hi> did,
or to preſcribe means and Expedients, unto the uſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all men ſhould be tyed up, who endeavour to propagate
or promote the Goſpel. For, that Chriſt did not mean to
ſet down poſitive and particular Laws of ſo wide an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for all things, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, the very different manner
of the delivering of the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Laws of
Chriſt doth plainly ſhew. <hi>Moſes</hi> had command to gather
the Ordinances of God together diſtinctly, that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Jewiſh Church, and orderly to ſet them down, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſeveral kinds, for each publick duty and
office the Laws that belong thereunto, as appears in the
Books themſelves written of purpoſe to that end. On the
other ſide, the Laws of Chriſt about the affairs of his
Church, we finde rather mentioned by occaſion in the
writings of the Apoſtles, than any ſolemn Thing directly
written to comprehend and Record them in a Legal
method and form; which I mention not (and therefore
let no envious eye make ſuch a conſtruction, ſeeing
it cannot be conſtrued) in diminution of the ſaid Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Laws,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52973:31"/>
which with a devout heart I reverence as
of the moſt ſacred and moſt tranſcendent Divine
Authority; but I hint this onely to intimate, that the
very different manner of the delivery of the Laws of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> touching Church-affairs, doth ſhew, that
the one had no intent to leave Laws, which might anſwer
the variety of Goſpel-occaſions in particulars of ſo large a
compaſs, as the other did to ſupply Church-occaſions in the
time of the Law. Beſides, be pleaſed to conſider, that when
<hi>Moſes</hi> gave thoſe poſitive Laws and Ordinances both Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
and Judicial, they were intended onely for that
particular Nation, who then were the ſole People, Houſe,
or Church of God, and accordingly God in the framing of
thoſe Laws, had an eye and regard to the nature of that
people for whom they were made, and peculiar and proper
Conſiderations were upon that account reſpected in the
compoſure, to anſwer moſt of the Occaſions that might
fall out in the adminiſtration of the Affairs of that Church
and State; which end might indeed eaſily be attained by
preſcribing Rules in and to a particular Nation: But when
Chriſt came, the Caſe was much altered; for whereas the
Houſe or Church of God in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, was confined to
one ſingle Nation, now it was to be made up out of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
The Laws of the Common-wealth were then made
conformable to the Order of Church: But the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel, being to ſpread through all States and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
was ſo formed, as it might without prejudice
to the Civil Peace, be entertained in any Nation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the framing of poſitive Laws, Rules, or Directions
of the ſame nature with thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which might ſerve
to fit the different Tempers and Conſtitutions, the various
neceſſities, Affairs and Occaſions of all the Nations of the
World, or of thoſe Remnants which ſhould be firſt convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all Nations, and oblige them to a very Puntilio, (as Mr.
<hi>G.</hi> pretends) was in the very nature of the thing altogether
impracticable, ſo it muſt have proved no leſs inconvenient,
then unneceſſary. For, Chriſt himſelf having appointed the
principal Ordinances before his departure, ſuch as might
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52973:31"/>
be conveniently made uſe of by the Church Univerſal; and
his Apoſtles having left divers Rules and Directions which
are of the ſame general concernment, and which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
ſerve to the principal parts of Oeconomy in
the Churches, in all the Nations of the world, its to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
he hath (by himſelf and his Apoſtles) done all that
the Father judged neceſſary for him to do on the behalf of
the Goſpel, and thereby approved himſelf <hi>faithfull in all
his Houſe, as</hi> Moſes <hi>was in his.</hi> And whereas I maintain,
that in particular matters of leſſer Importance, concerning
the way of carrying on the Goſpel, there are no poſitive
Laws or Rules to be found of ſo vaſt a Latitude and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
as to reach all Purpoſes, Occaſions, Accidents,
and Emergencies, in all ſucceeding times all over the world,
ſo as for ever to exclude altogether the uſe of humane
Reaſon and diſcretion from aſſiſting about the way and
means of publiſhing the Goſpel; this Aſſertion of mine is
ſo far from occaſioning any man thereupon to infer, or
imagine any defect of wiſdom and providence on the part
of our Lord and Saviour, that it is rather a clear Evidence
he hath (as becomes his Divine wiſdom and faithfulneſs)
therein ſo ordered the matter, as was moſt agreeable to
right Reaſon (which is a ray of the Divinity) and to the
nature and ſcope of His and his Fathers own great deſign
and intendment; which was, and is, To gather unto him ſelf
a People out of all Nations upon the face of the Earth. So
there is an end of his fourth Argument; in the confutation
whereof, it was neceſſary to enlarge thus a little more than
ordinary, becauſe as 'tis a ſuppoſition too much rooted in the
conceptions of men in theſe times, ſo he ſeems to build much
upon it, and with many flaſhes of Oſtentation to dazle the
eyes of the Reader. The reſidue of his Arguments which
follow, import little elſe but matter of ſcandal, to which,
though there be no other Anſwer due than what <hi>Michael</hi>
the Archangel gave the Devil, yet ſomewhat muſt be ſaid
to each of them by way of Animadverſion.</p>

               <p>IT might be wonder'd why Mr. <hi>G.</hi> (but that we know

his following Paragraphs by the name of Arguments,

do tumble of themſelves, and drop into their firſt

he inſinuateth, That the Commiſſioners entruſted are
<hi>an inconſiderable number of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his fifth Argument.</note> 
                  <hi>ſubject to the like errors,
paſſions, weakneſſes, and miſcarriages with other men; and
what a ſad buſineſs it muſt be to the godly people, that they
ſhould have a Negative voice about the placing, diſplacing,
and diſpoſing of all Miniſters over all Pariſhes in the Nation;</hi>
which he calls <hi>an unchriſtian and an unheard of Prodigie.</hi>
That the Commiſſioners are men ſubject to failings, as
other men, 'tis like they will not deny: But what will this
great prodigious Man at Arms in Argumentation from
thence infer? Will he ſay, <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ought not to be
truſted in the Buſineſs committed to them? Then, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
neither they nor any other men ought to be
truſted with the placing or diſplacing of Miniſters in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
becauſe none of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> can be found
free from the poſſibility of falling into ſome error or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
about the buſineſs. If this Arguing hold good,
then neither the Magiſtrate, nor any other Officer ought
to be allowed any Truſt in the Commonwealth in matters
concerning mens lives and eſtates, becauſe as men they
are ſubject to miſcarrying; and by conſequence alſo,
neither Patrons nor others who have any right or power
to preſent to Benefices, ſhould enjoy or exerciſe their right
or power of Preſenting, becauſe they may, through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
erre or do amiſs therein; which would be a rare acute
way of Reaſoning indeed, and may ſerve on the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as ſufficiently to ſubvert mens Rights in every thing,
deſtroy Government, and prove that All things in this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52973:32"/>
world ought to be left at random, becauſe men may erre
in point of Adminiſtration.—But the Commiſſioners
(he ſaith) are an <hi>inconſiderable number of men, and have a
Negative voice to place, diſplace, and diſpoſe.</hi> How many
the Commiſſioners, and who they are, may be ſeen by the
Ordinances themſelves, where the Reader will find they
are conſiderable for number, and for worth remarkable,
(over and above their Piety and Learning) for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
eſpecially, that they know not how to give the
right hand of fellowſhip to men of his corrupt behaviour
and perſwaſion; and that I ſhall manifeſt anon to be the
great reaſon why the man is ſo angry. And as to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
voice,</hi> you may ſee in the <hi>Ordinance for Approbation,</hi>
that no Vote in the Negative ſhall paſs for the diſapproving
of any man, unleſs Nine or more of the Commiſſioners be
preſent: Alſo, according to the <hi>Ordinance for Ejecting,</hi>
there are to be Ten preſent and concurring, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
or ejecting of any perſon. And ſo now the only
queſtion is, whoſe wiſdom is beſt to be relied on, either
that of our Governors, or Mr. <hi>Goodwin's,</hi> touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie
and ſufficiencie of the Number for ſuch purpoſes.
As to what he ſaith about <hi>placing and diſpoſing,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
neither have, nor aſſume any ſuch power, but
Patrons and others do now as inviolably enjoy their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Rights of Preſentation, as heretofore.</p>
               <p>Here before I go any further, I muſt needs take notice of
one thing in this Argument as very obſervable; and it is
this; That he takes upon him to plead for the power of
Choice to be in Pariſhes, or in the well-affected in Pariſhes;
and in regard that they have not the power of Chuſing,
therein it is that he placeth the greatneſs of the <hi>unchriſtian
and unheard of Prodigie.</hi> Now,</p>
               <p>1. Conſider, what is this to the Commiſſioners? They (as I
ſaid before) neither have, nor aſſume any power to chuſe
or diſpoſe of men to Places, nor are they the Cauſe why Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
or the well-affected in Pariſhes have not all the power
of chuſing their own Miniſters. The moſt remarkable and
prodigious thing is, to ſee how this mighty man of Reaſon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52973:33"/>
baffles himſelf ever and a non with ſelf-contradiction. Here
you have him eagerly aſſerting it to be a prodigious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that the ſeveral Pariſhes, or the well-affected in them
have not the ſaid power of chuſing: And then hereafter in
the Seventh Argument, we ſhall find him ſtiffly pleading on
the behalf of the Right and power of Patrons in matter of
chuſing; tricking it up with many Flowers of Rhetorick,
telling us that their Right of Preſentation is a <hi>Right in Law,
a Royal priviledge;</hi> and looks upon it as a violation offer'd
to their Throne and Dignity, if they may not in the utmoſt
freedom <hi>enjoy this Conveniencie,</hi> as he is pleaſed to term it.
But ſeeing this is as great an Intrenchment as any can be
imagined, upon the power of Pariſhes by him pleaded for,
if Patrons ought to have the power; therefore we have
need of another <hi>Oedipus</hi> to ſolve this Prodigie or Riddle in
Logick, otherwiſe called a Contradiction; <hi>That it ought,
and it ought not to be in Pariſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Conſider likewiſe, in caſe Pariſhes were entruſted
with the power of choice and nomination, what then
would be the conſequence? Certainly, thoſe godly and
well-affected ones by him mentioned, who are uſually the
leſſer number among them, would have the leaſt ſtroke in
the choice; the truth whereof ſufficiently appears in thoſe
Pariſhes who by right of purchaſe, or ſome other way
have the Patronage veſted in themſelves. It is ſad to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what wofull diviſions and diſtractions uſually ariſe
among them about their Choice (eſpecially if the living
be conſiderable) and common experience ſheweth, that
the godly and well-affected are uſually overborn by the
profane and more numerous Party. Sure, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
will not eaſily forget the experience which himſelf hath
had of the truth of this in his own particular.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds to tell us, <hi>If the Triers ſhall be froward,
or bear a grudge at a Pariſh,</hi> then the Pariſh will come to
be defeated of the Miniſter that is preſented to the place.
This gives me occaſion to obſerve the prudent Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the preſent Ordinance for Approbation, the
power thereby delegated being intruſted not in few, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52973:33"/>
many hands; and herein it concurs with the antient pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Nations, it being ever thought requiſite by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Governours to put a multitude in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
when they deſigned to prevent the carrying of
matters of high importance in a froward and paſſionate
way. The reaſon hereof is evident, becauſe right reaſon
and Juſtice are common Principles which all men have in
them more or leſſe, and do bear a reverence thereto by
the very light of Nature, and therefore when any thing
that is reaſonable and juſt comes to be inſiſted on, all men
do readily aſſent to it, except ſome who may be byaſſed
to the contrary by Paſſion. Now on the other ſide, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
though it be an Affect common to all men likewiſe
more or leſſe, yet being an infirmity of nature which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clouds reaſon, or ſuſpends the uſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it in the man,
or men ſo affected, tranſporting them to do things unjuſt,
it appears ſo unlovely in the eies of others who obſerve it,
that inſtead of conſenting with it, other men unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the cauſes and occaſions of the ſame Paſſion, are all
ready to paſſe a ſentence of Condemnation upon it; and
therefore as touching matters carried by the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
here impeached (who are many) put caſe that one or
two among them ſhould bear ſuch a grudge, as is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> or be froward becauſe of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Paſſion, how will he or they do to prevail over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principles of Reaſon and Juſtice which are in their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Commiſſioners? who being unconcerned in the private
paſſion of thoſe one or two, as it will be a hard matter for
theſe to perſwade them to concur with them, ſo thoſe one
or two will be aſhamed to preſſe them upon ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
to joyn with them in ſuffrage to do injuſtice one
way or other. What think ye then? Is it likely indeed, that
all the Triers (as he is pleaſed to term them) or that the
<hi>whole nine</hi> who are to be of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approvement,
ſhould concur in Spleen againſt a whole
Pariſh? yet upon this extream improbability, he placeth
the force of this part of his Argument, to prove that the
entruſting of the Commiſſioners for Approbation is an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52973:34"/>
Unchriſtian Prodigie. By this way of Arguing I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all the Deputations, Delegations, and Commiſſions
of men under heaven, that act in any kind, and ſubvert the
power of Patrons too into the bargain, if you will admit
me to make uſe of <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> and from an Hypothetical
Inſinuation that they may behave themſelves ill in their
Truſts, permit me Categorically to infer this poſitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
That therefore they are unlawful, or that it were
better to have none at all truſted in any employment, upon
any occaſion whatſoever. But this is the tranſcendent
<hi>Goodwinian</hi> way of Argumentation, well known at the
Divinity-School in <hi>Coleman</hi>-University.</p>
               <p>Moreover, to prove that the entruſting of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
is <hi>an unchriſtian unheard of Prodigie,</hi> he tells us,
<hi>They may judge a man unſound in the Faith, whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
ſhall deſire for their Miniſter, becauſe of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Opinion, one or more, for-which (it is poſſible) the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
may in ſpecial manner deſire him, and can deſire
and admit of none that is contrary-minded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
may never be permitted to enjoy a Miniſter by whom
they can edifie.</hi> The Commiſſioners are unchriſtian, becauſe
they may judge a man unſound in the Faith! This is rare
ſtuff both in Reaſon and Religion, is it not? Suppoſe the
man whom a Congregation or Pariſh (for they are Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Congregations only, which have maintenance by
Law, that the Commiſſioners are concerned to take notice
of) ſhould hold ſome execrable blaſphemous Opinion,
or ſome other Opinion dangerous to the Chriſtian verity,
though not ſo formidable at firſt ſight as the other, and that
a Congregation ſhould deſire him eſpecially for that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
ſhould not the Commiſſioners reject ſuch a one,
whom they find to be ſo upon examination? Or were it fit
to gratifie the deſires of a Pariſh by permitting ſuch a man
to be their Miniſter, who would be a means of confirming
them in the ſame condemnable Opinion? Let Chriſtians
judge who are moſt unchriſtian and prodigious (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
by diſapproving ſuch a man, or Mr. <hi>G.</hi> by
recommending him) in reference to this particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52973:34"/>
But for a more full Anſwer, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> may pleaſe to conſider,
1. That it never was heretofore, nor is it now agreeable to
the purpoſe or conveniencie of this State, to imploy the
Publick Maintenance for the encouraging of this, that, or
the other particular Opinion; but it was firſt intended and
ſetled for the upholding of a Publick profeſſion of Religion
in the Nation, and for the ſupport of thoſe Miniſters that
agree with the Magiſtrate in the ſame Publick profeſſion.
And upon this ground it was, that the Statute of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> required a Subſcription to the XXXIX Articles
of Religion, which then were eſtabliſhed as the Publick
Profeſſion; otherwiſe, no man was to be admitted to a
Benefice with Cure of Souls; it being moſt reaſonable,
that the State ſhould do what they would with their own,
and accordingly diſpoſe of the State-maintenance, for the
maintaining of ſuch a Publick Profeſſion, as they in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
believed to be moſt agreeable to the Word of God.
2. Suppoſe that both <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Approvers</hi> were removed,
and all left to Pariſh-choice, yet I cannot underſtand that
the generality of Pariſhes are ſuch Opinioniſts, as to be
indeared to ſome one or two ſpecial Opinions; whenas the
truth is, they are led by other Conſiderations, when they
have a mind to receieve or refuſe a Miniſter. Of all men
living, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath leaſt reaſon to plead for Pariſhes in this
reſpect. Was he choſen Vicar of <hi>Coleman ſtreet</hi> Pariſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
for his one or two ſpecial and ſingular Opinions?
Nay rather, did not the Pariſh, when they had a ſeaſon and
occaſion to feel their own ſtrength, and after he had been
a painful Labourer among them many years, take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
becauſe of ſuch Opinions, to eject him, and place
another in his Biſhoprick? The truth is, (and that Mr.
<hi>Goodwin's</hi> own Conſcience tells him) if there might be no
other ſupply made for Pariſhes throughout <hi>England,</hi> but
ſuch as the Pariſhioners, or a major part of them can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
reverence and affect, the man ſo choſen in moſt Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
would be a man in a Surplice, with the Common-Prayer-Book,
devoutly obſerving all the Ceremonies and
Feſtivals, and giving Bread and Wine round the Pariſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52973:35"/>
Theſe are the ſpecial Opinions and Practices
one or more, for which ('tis poſſible) moſt Pariſhes in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> may <hi>in ſpecial manner deſire ſuch a man,
and can deſire and admit of none that is contrary-minded.</hi>
Yet perhaps Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his <hi>Arminian</hi> ſpecial Opinions (one
or more) may go far with the Common people, who have
a mind to live as they liſt, and to live ſo long as they liſt;
becauſe according to thoſe Opinions of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſo pleaſing
to fleſh and blood, they may when they pleaſe ſet themſelves
on work to mend their condition. But yet thoſe ſpecial
Opinions, though pleaſing enough, would not pleaſe half
ſo well, and open but a few Pariſh-doors in this Nation, in
compariſon of thoſe that would be opened to Superſtition
and Malignancie, and one or more of ſuch ſpecial Opinions.
Nevertheleſs, provided the door may be large enough (ſo
large is this dying mans Conſcience, or the dying Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this man) to let in <hi>Arminians</hi> into a few Pariſhes,
then, though Popery, Superſtition, Profaneneſs, and the
Devil himſelf ſhould by that means get into the reſt of the
Pariſhes, he takes no care, he could notwithſtanding die
quietly.</p>
               <p>3. The power of Choice and Nomination to Livings
was never yet intruſted ſolely in the hands of Pariſhes, but
it hath remained partly in the hands of the Magiſtrate as
the grand Patron, partly in the hands of private Patrons,
who had a Right to it either by Inheritance or Purchaſe:
But yet ſtill the Magiſtrate and the Law interpoſed as to
the power of Trying and Approving men preſented, and
ſetled a Courſe accordingly for the Trial and Examination
of them, before they were admitted to enjoy that Publick
Maintenance which was legally annexed to the Places to
which they had been preſented. This hath been the practice
from all Antiquity; and yet he is pleaſed to laſh out againſt
the preſent Courſe appointed for Approbation, as unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
and prodigious: And therefore I think rather he (this
ill-portending Comet, this wandring Star of Error and
Falſhood, who would ſeem to be one of thoſe real ones
fixed in the Firmament of the Church, but hangs only in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52973:35"/>
the Air, as if he were to uſher ſome greater Hereſies into the
world) is himſelf indeed a moſt unchriſtian Prodigie.</p>
               <p>He ends this Argument with telling us, <hi>The Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
may obtrude a man upon a Congregation</hi> (pro libitu ſuo)
<hi>be he never ſo froward, inſufficient, or ill-conditioned, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</hi>
Read over the <hi>Ordinance for Approbation</hi> (which
is their Commiſſion) and you will find this to be like the
reſt of his ſtories: For (as I have ſaid already) if a man
that is preſented to a place happen to be diſ-approved by
them upon examination, they have no power of placing
any other there in his ſtead, but ſuch perſon or perſons who
have right thereunto.</p>

               <p>NOw to the ſixth Argument (much like the former)

Rights and Priviledges of the people of God, who are

they pleaſe, and keep aſunder them whom God would have
joyned together, if they will not yea it, and nay it with them
from the one end of their faith to the other.</hi> This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
being compared with the former, ſuppoſeth two
ſorts of Congregations in the Nation; which is granted,
<hi>Viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

only (ſo far as in charity we are able to judge)
of perſons fearing the Lord in truth and ſincerity. The
Miniſter of the one we uſually term Parſon or Vicar;
and the Miniſter of the other Paſtor or Teacher. It is
of the latter that in this place he aſſerts this priviledge,
but it is with the former only that the Commiſſioners
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52973:36"/>
have to do. Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> could himſelf have ſolved this
doubt without my help. He knoweth, that the Vicar of
the Pariſh Aſſembly of <hi>Stephens Colemanſtreet</hi> may either
be put in or put out, and yet the Paſtor of that remnant
of ſheep (uſually aſſembling in ſome private houſe in <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtreet</hi>)
remain in his Paſtoral relation ſtill, and neither
be put in or out by either of theſe Commiſſions. And yet
he hath the confidence to ſpeak what he ſaith, at large,
of the people of God in general; whereas 'tis well enough
known, that what priviledge ſoever the people of God
in gather'd Congregations have exerciſed heretofore in
the chuſing and retaining of their own ſpiritual Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
they do ſtill enjoy and exerciſe with the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;

Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> to no purpoſe but to fill up the Page; and ſo

ſcandal, which he calls his ſeventh Argument, and under the
name of an Argument he will needs obtrude it upon the
Reader, whereas it is nothing leſſe; for it concerneth an
Accuſer both <hi>in foro externo,</hi> and <hi>interno,</hi> that if he brings
in an Accuſation of Fact againſt any man, or number of
men, he ſhould produce Inſtances as an Argument to prove
the Accuſation, or elſe he muſt ſtand condemned of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation,
both before the world, and in his own conſcience,
for want of due proof: But Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> brings not ſo
much as one ſingle Inſtance towards the making of ſuch
an Argument; <hi>Ergo,</hi> He is an errant Calumniator.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if you look a little narrowly into it, you
will finde this directly contradictory to the two foregoing
arguments. In the fifth he pleads, as if it were the Civil
Right and Royalty of the People in a Pariſh to chuſe. Then
in the ſixth, he pleads for it, as one of the Spiritual Rights
and Priviledges of the People of God onely to chuſe. And
now again, in this ſeventh, he forgets both theſe, and falls
ſtifly to pleading on the behalf of Patrons, aſſerting the
power of choice to be in them, as a Royal Priviledge and
matter of Conveniencie intended them by the Law, by
which means he now thruſts the Rights that he before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
on the behalf of the other two quite out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar.
<hi>Saevis inter ſe convenit <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſis, Bears uſually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
together,</hi> yet theſe Arguments of his are ſo wilde
and ſavage, that it is not in the power of man to tame
them or bring them to conſiſtency and correſpondence
with each other, ſo as to apprehend what he intends by
either. Onely, this is evident, that ſomewhat he would ſay
againſt the <hi>Commiſſion of Tryers</hi> (as he is pleaſed to terme
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52973:37"/>
them) and ſo being in paſſion cares not what he ſaith, but
utters what makes rather for, than againſt them. For he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
Patrons have a Right; alſo, that their Right
is a Civil legal Right (and upon that account he pretends
to defend it againſt the Commiſſioners, as violaters of it,
though neither their Commiſſion, nor their practice do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
upon it;) and therefore if by his own Confeſſion it
be a Civil Right to chuſe, then doubtleſs to examine and
judge, whether the man ſo choſen be fit or no, muſt needs be
a Civil Act; and ſo the care of examining, and approving
accordingly, cannot be denied to the Civil Magiſtrate now;
more then in former times, unleſs (like your worthy Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in this Plea, Mr. <hi>Poſtlethwait</hi>) you would have no Law-giver,
no Magiſtrate but Chriſt in the Commonwealth.
Thus you ſee, by making uſe of that which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> himſelf
before confeſſeth, (<hi>viz.</hi> that the Right of Preſentation
ſtands upon a meer Civil account) it followeth plain,
that the Civil Power hath a Right to approve men to
thoſe Civil and Temporal (which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> calleth <hi>Spiritual</hi>)
Demeſnes, and that they have done but of what right they
ought to do, in entruſting certain perſons to act under
them, as Commiſſioners for Approbation.</p>
               <p>But how comes it to paſs that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is ſo earneſt an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
on the behalf of Patrons? By this I perceive,
that all the Subjects of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> are not of one
minde; for his brother Mr. <hi>Poſtlethwait,</hi> who hath dipt
his Pen likewiſe againſt the Triers (ſo he alſo calls the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners)
is altogether as hot againſt Patrons, crying out
in his<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Entituled,</hi> A Voice from Heaven againſt the Triers.</note> Book, page 72, <hi>Away with Patrons—thoſe
moſt abominable uſurpers; durſt</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>exerciſe
ſuch Tyranny, as to impoſe a Miniſter upon the People?</hi> and
he goeth on page 73 thus: <hi>Away therefore with theſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
uſurpers—Though it be under more reſtraint
now then formerly, this will not ſalve the matter.</hi> What Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
pretends a crime in the Triers, his brother <hi>Poſtlethwait</hi>
looks upon it as a vertue, and thinks the fault is this, that
Patrons are not reſtrained enough by the Triers, whereas
indeed the <hi>Triers</hi> (ſo called) do not all ſtreighten Patrons
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52973:37"/>
in their Rights, but rather preſerve them. However Mr.
<hi>Poſtlethwait</hi> tells us page 84. <hi>he muſt confeſs, that at firſt he
was pretty well ſatisfied with the Ordinance.</hi> Tis true, he was
ſo well ſatisfied, that he came up and took <hi>Approbation</hi> from
the Commiſſioners, but afterwards being returned, he, like
his brother <hi>Goodwin,</hi> is blown about to another point in
Judgement; And though in <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi>-Principles
they are the ſame, and in mutability the ſame, yet being
carried with ſeveral winds they vary; for Mr. <hi>Poſtlethwait</hi>'s
next words tells us, he <hi>was pretty well ſatisfied with the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for the Commiſſioners ſitting, ſaving that its grounded
in part upon the defence of Patron's Rights and Properties.</hi>
Then ſaith he, <hi>That which ſatisfied me at firſt was, that their
Commiſſion gives them not power to inveſt into office; but that
will not anſwer all my ſcruples now</hi> (a very growing man he
is in ſcruples!) <hi>for, though they are not to inveſt into Office, yet
they are to take the beginnings of their Proceeding from the
Preſentation of the Patron, who preſents to benefice with Cure
of Souls originally; and I know no qualification that is put
on his Preſentation, but onely a care taken to preſerve his
Right and Property.</hi> I cannot but commend this ingenuity
of Mr. <hi>Poſtlethwait,</hi> which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is not willing to imitate.
Time was, when Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> uſed theſe following words,
[<hi>The time was I was pretty well ſatisfied,</hi> &amp;c.] which time
was juſt the eighth of <hi>Frebruary,</hi> 1651. for then you (Sir)
and your Elder, Mr. <hi>Price,</hi> ſubſcribed with others, an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſire to the Parliament, that two ſuch Ordinances as
now you write againſt, might be eſtabliſhed by the Civil
Magiſtrate: But you (Sir) you that have the <hi>Staggers</hi> in
the Brain, it is not for you to remember, or be of one minde
long together.</p>
               <p>As to that paſſage of his before-recited, wherein he ſaith,
<hi>the Commiſſioners are found Patrons</hi> (effectivè) <hi>to all the
Livings in the Nation,</hi> let me add thus much further by way
of Anſwer. 1. Is it likely that his Highneſs and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ſhould ſo pen an Ordinance, that one part of it ſhould
contradict and utterly make avoid another, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s
Scriblings uſe to do? This is to let the world know how
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52973:38"/>
little he eſteems their prudence, and how much his own.
But his principal Aim is at the Commiſſioners; <hi>who,</hi> he
ſaith, <hi>are of Approvers become Patrons;</hi> yes, and worſe too;
for Patrons do not, or ſhould not make a gain of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations.
But he dares not ſpeak out; for, his own heart
knoweth, he hath not the leaſt pretence for it, yet it ſeems
he could wiſh it were ſo, and therefore inſinuateth ſuch a
baſeneſs, in ſuch Covert terms (which he knows well how
to do) as may not amount to a direct charge. Is this a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man, who endeavours here to faſten ſo high and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
an Accuſation upon the Commiſſioners? whoſe
known integrity hath extorted another Character con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, even from himſelf, in his Epiſtle before this
very Book, Where he ſaith, that he <hi>beleeves them to be men
of Conſcience and worth, fearing God, and lovers of Truth:</hi>
So that you have waters of Contradiction, bitter and ſweet,
proceeding from the fame Fountain. And obſerving this,
I reſolve to inform my ſelf more fully both from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and by other Enquiries, whether it be poſſible,
that men deſerving that high Teſtimony which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them in his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> ſhould ſo totally fall from grace,
and all ingenuity, as to become ſuch as he makes them in his
<hi>Book;</hi> and this pains I the rather take, that ſo Mr. <hi>G.</hi> may
appear the more illuſtrious in his Art of Calumnie and ſelf-contradiction.
As to what he objects about <hi>the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
diſpoſing of Livings, and becoming</hi> effectivè <hi>Patrons.</hi>
1. Take notice the Ordinance ſaith no ſuch matter. By it
they cannot give Approbation to any perſon who brings
not a Preſentation or nomination from a Patron. They
give admiſſion to none but it is upon Record, and entred
into a Book, with the name of the Patron, the names of
thoſe who certifie, and the date, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which any man may
ſee that hath a minde to it; and then will be able to ſay,
whether there was ever yet any perſon put into any Living
by them, that was not firſt preſented by the Patron. 2. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
If the Perſon preſented be diſapproved, it muſt be
by nine, or a greater number; and certainly, for any one
Commiſſioner to compaſs his end upon ſuch a number, it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52973:38"/>
will not onely require great ſubtilty in him, but great ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
in the reſt, of which crime they ſeem as yet to ſtand
cleer with Mr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi> But ſuppoſe a man ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
upon ſome ſuch deſign, what are the Commiſſioners,
or any one of them the better for this, if they ſhould have
a deſign to bring a friend in his room? Is it likely the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
will be ſo much in love with the Commiſſioners for
this their forwardneſs in putting by his friend every way
worthy, that he will ſo eaſily be induced to preſent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their recommending? If he ſhould, certainly he hath
little of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> precious ſpirit of revenge in him.
But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſaith further, That the Commiſſioners can put
men by, that are preſented, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> until the ſix
moneths be run out, and the Living lapſed to his Highneſs;
of whom, or from the Lords Commiſſioners of the great
Seal, they will by their Intereſt obtain the Living for a
Friend. But (Mr. <hi>G.</hi>) can you give Inſtances of any ſuch
practices frequent among them? if you can, it well becomes
you to do it. If he could give but one Inſtance, the
world ſhould have heard it loud enough: For can any man
that reads this Pamphlet of his, imagine him ſo much in
love with the Commiſſioners, or ſo indulgent to their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
that if he knew any thing this way, he would conceal
it for their ſakes? Well then, let Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> be Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
and give me leave to tell the world before his face
what I finde.—The Commiſſioners wiſely foreſeeing
what odious neceſſary work they had undertaken, and how
provoking it was like to be to witty unworthy perſons,
who are able to dreſs up ſurmiſes and jealouſies, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
ſuggeſt any ſlander againſt them that hath but the
leaſt colour of Truth, though never ſo falſe (I ſay, the
Commiſſioners foreſeeing this) did by Joynt-Conſent,
among many other Orders, make this; <hi>That no Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſhould endeavour the procuring from his Highneſs,
or from the Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, any ſuch
Living, for any friend or relation, the vacancie or Lapſe
whereof hath been occaſioned by the inſufficiency of a perſon or
perſons preſented, and refuſed by them.</hi> And I am able with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52973:39"/>
the greateſt confidence to affirm, that an Inſtance cannot
be given throughout <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> whereby you can
make it appear, that they have not in the greateſt ſeverity
obſerved this Order; or that any Commiſſioner hath, by
any ſuch ſubtilty, or intereſt, preferred a man ſince their
ſitting. He that hath a large Phant'ſie, and a large Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may irrecoverably wrong the innocenteſt perſon in
the World.</p>
               <p>Then, whereas he talks (like himſelf) of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
receiving the Tribute of thanks and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to Patrons (<hi>if no baſer metal withal</hi>) from thoſe
whom (as he pretends) they ſo preferr; He thereby inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth
and tempts men to beleeve what he hath not the
leaſt ground to aſſert, namely, that they have not onely
wreſted Patrons Rights out of their hands, but do diſpoſe
of them in a way of gain to themſelves. By the words
[<hi>Baſer Metal</hi>] he would give men occaſion to ſuſpect, that
they receive metal or money in the baſe way of Bribery;
yet in his Epiſtle he terms them <hi>men of Conſcience and worth,
fearing God.</hi> Certainly, this man hath ſtrange Notions, as
in other Points, ſo about the nature of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the
<hi>Fear of God;</hi> but if he mean to have himſelf ſo thought
and judged of in ſuch dealings as theſe, he had need lend
us ſome other Notion of a Conſcionable man fearing
God, then as yet we have commonly received. I am
ſure, if he had but the Conſcience of a Moral Man;
that is, if he thought it juſt and honeſt to prove or
give Inſtances when he accuſeth, he would not thus
voluntarily have given himſelf up to his ſervice (with
whom he deſerves to ſhare in Title) who is indeed
the <hi>Grand Accuſer,</hi> nor have ſacrificed his Pen a
weapon of unrighteouſneſs, as he doth in every page of
his Book.</p>

                  <hi>That in the dayes of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
when the Biſhops were Tryers, if they upon a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
or illegal pretence, refuſed to admit any preſented to
them, there lay a</hi> Quare impedit <hi>againſt them for remedy in
Law;</hi> but the Commiſſioners (he ſaith) have power now,
<hi>Beyond the Biſhops, and above all Law.</hi> But how doth he
make this out? not with any rational Evidence, but clothes
his irrational Inſinuations in Scripture-phraſe, in hope to
make them take the more plauſibly, and ſink the deeper.
<hi>In their proceedings</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they eſteem all Laws as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan
eſteems Iron and Braſſe, who eſteemeth Iron as Straw,
and Braſſe as rotten wood.</hi> This is baiting the hook with
<hi>Leviathan</hi> to catch a <hi>Gudgeon,</hi> making a great deal ado
to little purpoſe. For firſt, there is no uſe now of the
Old Law concerning the <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> the Reaſon of it
being gone: For, it was the practice of the Biſhops here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
when a Clerk had been preſented to any of them
by a Patron, many times to deny him <hi>Inſtitution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi>
and then uſe ſleights to baffle off both the Clerk
and his Patron from time to time, that ſo the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Patron was to preſent being Lapſed, the power of
Preſentation might fall into the Biſhops own hands (as
by Law it was to do in caſe of a Lapſe) by which means
Patrons came to be defeated of their Rights, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
gained thereby an opportunity to prefer their own
Chaplains and creatures into livings: For remedy of this
abuſe it was, that the <hi>Quare impedit</hi> was appointed. But
now there is no ſuch occaſion for the uſe of it againſt the
preſent Commiſſioners, becauſe they have no power to act
the ſame abuſe; for in caſe they reject a man that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
the Patron may preſent another; and in caſe it ſhall
happen at any time through his own default, that the
Preſentation be Lapſed, the Commiſſioners have no
power to place another in the living, but the Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52973:40"/>
upon a <hi>Lapſe</hi> devolveth of courſe into the hands of the
Lord Protector. Moreover, he forgets that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
act by an Ordinance, which at firſt was equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to a Law, and is now become a Law, in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Law, and how then can they be ſaid to be above
Law? Beſides, he doth not conſider, That this Law, called
the Ordinance, is much more ſuitable to the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it makes a more Goſpel-like and ſtrict proviſion for
the trying of Perſons, then former Laws did, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
having heretofore a greater Indulgence by Law, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Qualifications required to be in them for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the Miniſtery, and the Biſhops accordingly had a
greater latitude of power, as well as Conſcience, to give
them an eaſie approbation and admittance to the work of
the Goſpel; and that was the reaſon why the Benefices of
this Nation became ſo well ſtocked with numbers of
ſtrange licentious and ſcandalous Miniſters, moſt of which
(if not all) were of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> own Heterodox opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt the great truths of Gods <hi>electing love in Chriſt,</hi>
and the <hi>Saints perſeverance,</hi> and held the other contrary
coincident Phant'ſies, which neceſſitate the Owners in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the maintaining of them, to torment and ſubvert
the whole Analogy of Scripture. If Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> were
the pious man indeed that he would be thought to be, he
would rather bleſſe God and commend our Governours,
who have taken ſuch an eſpecial care by the two Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
that the Rules therein being obſerved, ſuch brute
Beaſts cannot enter the Lords Vineyard in time to come,
and that if any ſhould (by accident) enter, they may ſoon
be ejected. But alas, his great buſineſs is, to propagate
his own opinion, and becauſe ſome of the Sons of the

into poſſeſſion, and ſo have run and complained to him
who hath ambition enough to be thought their Father,

of <hi>Arminius,</hi> as he was of the more antient Hereticks)
it is for the ſakes of theſe Sons of his, that his bowels are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52973:40"/>
moved, eſpecially his Spleen, the dark vapors whereof have
ſo obſcured the light of his Conſcience and Underſtanding,
that he ſeeth not the neceſſity, the equity, and piety of the
two Ordinances, which provide againſt a return of the
like men of Belial into the work of the Goſpel; and the
ſharp humors which proceed from an overflowing of the
Gall, have ſo raiſed his paſſions, that the uſe of Reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

upon the belief of the World.</p>
               <p>But he (it ſeems) is as bold as <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and having a

Reader muſt pardon this Levity, if I uſe it a little now and
then; it is borrowed from him out of his Book; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there can no ſutable Reply be made to him without it,
who in ſtead of Argument, ſpends the main of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
in Quips and Taunts againſt the Commiſſioners,
calling them <hi>A rule-leſs, lawleſs, controlleſs generation of
men, the like whereof were never ſet over the Lords people in
this Nation;</hi> And the Commiſſion he terms <hi>the like inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
yoke about the necks of the Free-born people.</hi> And all
this (forſooth) he vomits up againſt the preſent Authority,
becauſe they have given Rules and Directions by a Law to
prove men whether they be ſound in the Faith, before they
be ſent to preach the Faith; and againſt the Commiſſioners
becauſe they act under them to the ſame purpoſe, and take
care to do that which <hi>Paul</hi> commanded <hi>Timothy,</hi> which
was, <hi>To commit the Word of the Goſpel to faithful men;</hi>
and to follow the counſel of <hi>John</hi> in refuſing ſuch as are

falſe Teachers, and not bidding them <hi>God ſpeed</hi> by giving

Servant ſhall give you part of your payment. That there are
in this Nation men of various Judgments in divers Points,
who are eminent for Parts and Piety, we grant; and it is no
little part of our glory that we have ſuch; but 'tis much
of ſorrow, that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſeems not to be of the number.
Thoſe Parts which he hath, he hath endeavoured to ſhew
them to the utmoſt in the holſtering up of that unhappy
Controverſie, for which he is ambitious to be known.
Some men have an itching pride to leave themſelves a name
famous upon Record, though with infamy: This ſet a
Fellow on work to fire the renowned Temple of <hi>Diana;</hi>
and this only humor hath (I verily believe) ſtirr'd up many
a vain Heretick to kindle and blow a fire of Controverſie in

itchie; yet in all the Ink that he hath ſcratched and ſcribled
with about that Queſtion, or any other, Oſtentation is one
of the principal Ingredients; upon which Account I have
obſerved, when many a man hath been engaged, that it
hath drawn a cloud over his Intellectuals, ſo that being in

right way by an active and victorious Phant'ſie, which
eaſily inforceth any thing that offers it ſelf (though it be but
to build, or maintain an Intereſt) upon the Underſtanding.
An Intellect that is bribed with Intereſt, will go far to own
and uphold a matter even againſt Conſcience; but yet
there is hope ſuch a one may be rectified, when Intereſt
altereth in ſuch a manner, that the mans ends may as well
be ſerved by owning the Truth; and upon this account
many a Heretick hath of himſelf renounced his Error, and
imbraced the Truth. But when an Intellect is once baffled,
ſubdued, and (as it were) enſlaved to a lofty, luxuriant,
Lordly Phant'ſie, then in ſuch a Phant'ſie it is that Satan
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52973:42"/>
erects his throne, rules and reigns there; then there is never
any taking the man off by all the offers that can be made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Reaſon or Advantage: Nothing leſs than the mighty
power of the ſame Spirit that raiſed Jeſus from the dead,
can reſcue ſuch a man out of the power of darkneſs,
and reſtore him to a right Apprehenſion. By the one, or
the other of thoſe two ways it is, (<hi>viz.</hi> either by Satans
bribing the Intellect with Intereſt, or by his ſeating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon a towering Phant'ſie to controll and befool the
Intellectual Faculty) that all the Hereticks in the world
have been made. I ſhall not apply this to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> nor judge
him ſo far as to faſten the odious name of <hi>Heretick</hi> upon
him: But this I will take leave to acknowledge as his due,
(becauſe all his Works do manifeſt it) that he is a man
of a working, capering, ſtately Phant'ſie; and ſo the beſt
of his Parts lying therein, he might (as we find by this Piece
of his) have made a notable Poet, or a Painter: But, as
a good Poet and a good Divine, a good Poet and a good
Logician, a good Poet and a good Stateſman do very
ſeldom meet in one, (becauſe in every Profeſſion where
the uſe of a ſober Reaſon is requiſite, the more ſober and
ſolid it will be, if the Phant'ſie be the leſs brisk and frisking
to diſturb it) ſo Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath verified this abundantly
throughout his preſent diſcourſe: The luxuriancie of a
flouriſhing Phant'ſie manifeſted in the dreſs and ſuper-abundance
of his Fictions, do ſhew him to be a ready Poet
and Painter both; but for a Divine, as to ſound knowledge
in affairs reſpecting Religion and the Goſpel; and for a
Logician, as to matter of Reaſon and Argumentation, you
may perceive already by what is paſt, I have no reaſon to
allow him: And now being to ſee how he will play his part
in the Politicks as a Stateſman, I fear I ſhall find but playing-work,
as little of Reaſon &amp; Religion in this his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Arg. as
in any of the other; and that his gray head, though pouder'd
by Time, is as poetical and phantaſtical as any young Boy's
in the Town. Thus having rambled a little in a digreſſion,
'tis high time to return to the matter, in hope the Phantſiful
man (who was not wont to be long of an opinion) is not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52973:42"/>
yet ſo deſperately given to <hi>Opiniaſtrie,</hi> but that he may be
brought to ſee and retract his Errors.—'Tis well (I ſay)
that we have in this Nation ſo many pious and able men,
though differing in ſome Points from each other: But
what have they in Authority done to make one Part Judges
over the other? Can any man in his ſenſes infer, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Commiſſioners are veſted with a power to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and try whether men be fitly qualified for the work of
the publick Miniſtry before they enter upon it, therefore
they are made Judges over all men of parts and piety in
the Nation that are not of the ſame Judgment with them?
This Charge ſtretcheth wide, and with a great noiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis empty; for, it is only thoſe particular mens Gifts
and Graces that they are Commiſſionated to enquire into,
who come to them, in order to that publick Maintenance
which the Magiſtrate and the Law alloweth; and they
neither have, nor do they aſſume any power to refuſe men
becauſe of the ſeveral ways and forms wherein they walk,
or becauſe of their Opinions, provided they in their ways
be not licentious nor diſorderly, nor their Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Faith and ſound Doctrine; of which certainly 'tis
but reaſon that the Magiſtrate, or thoſe men whom he thinks
fit to truſt for the purpoſe, ſhould be Judges, that he in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
may be ſatisfied either mediately or immediately, of
the Fitneſs of thoſe men, before he give them his Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Moreover, leſt it ſhould be thought that the way to
this Maintenance ſhould not be open to any but men of
ſome one particular perſwaſion or form, one would think
the very Tenor of the former Conſtitution of Government,
and of the preſent, might ſerve to ſtop the mouth of Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
it being apparent both in the one and the other, that an
equal regard was and is had to all the people of God under
different perſwaſions and ſeveral forms: And as this hath
been, and is the ſcope of the Government in general, ſo
particularly in thoſe two Buſineſſes of <hi>Approbation</hi> and
<hi>Ejection,</hi> to the end that no partiality may be uſed in the
execution of either, towards any man, in any kind, becauſe
of his private Opinion, (if it be not deſtructive to this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52973:43"/>
Publick, the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Truths therein contained) or becauſe of the Form
under which he walks, ſo ſpecial a regard hath been had
in the choice of the Commiſſioners, that pious, ſober and
learned men of ſeveral ways and perſwaſions are taken into
the number, who being entruſted to execute the Ordinances,
are ſo ballanced in this reſpect among themſelves, that it
were abſurd to imagine they ſhould agree to deſign an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning
of any one Way or Opinion, for the oppreſſing
of all the other; or that any pious and ſober man of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
parts, who comes to them, ſhould ſuffer becauſe of
his particular Way or Opinion. And that this is the truth
of the matter, any one may be ſatisfied that will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the quality, conſtitution, and conſtant practice of the
Commiſſioners. And in the next place, whereas he ſuggeſts
that there is <hi>no remedy by way of Appeal</hi> againſt them, in caſe
they ſhould abuſe their power, He himſelf by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
knows knows the contrary, having not long ago
made an Appeal upon ſuch a pretence againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
on the behalf of another, to his Highneſs the
Lord Protector, before whom the Appeal was admitted,
and the Buſineſs heard.</p>
               <p>Beſides, in this Accuſation touching Non-Appeal, he doth
not only gainſay what his own doings, but alſo what his own
ſayings do confirm; and there is neither of theſe but are as
dear to him (except Revenge) as any thing in the world.
And yet he is pleaſed to contradict himſelf alſo in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to this particular. For, he who is ſo audacious here,
as to ſay men are <hi>without remedy or relief either by Appeal
or otherwiſe,</hi> hath forgotten what he affirms in other places
of his Book, where he acknowledgeth ſuch a Power in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as may, and (if it be faithful) will relieve ſuch as may
have occaſion to appeal. Caſes of Appeal to a higher Power
are occaſioned, in reſpect either of miſinterpreting the Law,
or of male-adminiſtration, though the mind of the Law be
rightly underſtood: Now, if ſo be it ſhall fall out, that
wrong be done to any by wreſting the ſenſe of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
then, as himſelf hath ſaid (<hi>pag.</hi> 4.) in plain terms,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52973:43"/>
                  <hi>Thoſe who are in Authority have power to declare the ſenſe of
either Commiſſion, Viz.</hi> Of either Ordinance: And on the
other ſide, if the Commiſſioners ſhall behave themſelves
otherwiſe than they ought in the adminiſtration or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ordinances; He tells us in his <hi>page</hi> 20. The
Commiſſioners <hi>are (its greatly feared) more than connived
at, by thoſe who have power to reſtrain them from their evil.</hi>
If by his own confeſſion there be a power to whom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
may be made in caſe of miſ-interpretation of the
Ordinances, or in caſe of miſ-behaviour to reſtrain the
Commiſſioners from evil, pray you then what can be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a remedy by appeal againſt them? Both theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are you ſee now <hi>in terminis</hi> acknowledged by this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
ſelf condemned creature; ſo that I cannot but propoſe
him to the World, eſpecially to thoſe who are in Authority,
as a Subject of Pity, rather than of my Triumph, or their
diſpleaſure. Thus you ſee what his Politicks amount to,
his Political advice being of the ſame nature with his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological
Diſcourſe, the one running upon falſe Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning Goſpel-verity, the other being grounded
upon Suppoſitions of Scandal which he takes a priviledge
at pleaſure to caſt upon the Civil Government; which
being proved to be falſe, his Argument in Policie (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is pleaſed to tell our Governours how impolitick it
is for them to do what they never did, nor ever thought to
do) is much of the ſame ſort with his other Arguments,
(as he calls them) in <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe by the wiſdom and favour of Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
here is an occaſion miniſtred to diſcuſs a point of
policy, pray let me have a little leave to lay his high pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and charity in one ballance, and the prudence and
bounty of the State in the other, that ſo I may do him
right (as it becomes his Grandeur) by comparing him and
our Superiours together.<note place="margin">A true State of the deſign and purport of the Ordinance for Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The State have been pleaſed
to ſettle and confirm a publick maintenance by Law for
the publick preaching of the Goſpel; and becauſe it is not
like that a work of ſo high and heavenly a concernment
ſhould take ſo good an effect as is to be deſired and ſought
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52973:44"/>
for among the people, if ſo be that a courſe be not taken
to commit it into the hands of faithful and able men,
therefore they for the ſatisfying of their own conſciences
in diſcharge of their duty and concern, in Order to the
promoting of the work, have thought fit to ſelect a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, whom for the opinion they have of their
piety, faithfulneſs and knowledge in the things of God,
they conceive they may ſafely truſt with the trying and
examining of all perſons who deſire the State mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to ſupport them in that work, whether they have
gifts and Parts anſwerable to the employment; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
they have eſtabliſhed that ſelected number of perſons
as Commiſſioners, with a power either to reject men,
if they find them not qualified for the work, or if they find
they have fit qualifications, then to approve them being
preſented or recommended, and give them a legal Title,
to poſſeſſe and enjoy all the Rights and Profits which are
legally annexed to the places for their maintenance in ſo
good a Work as the Preaching of the Goſpel. This on
the States part, ſo far as concerns their Bounty and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this particular.—On the other ſide, let us
counterpoiſe them with the better charity, and diſcretion
of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> His Charity is ſeen in this, that he would have
the Magiſtrate without any more ado, to give a publick
maintenance to any man that offers himſelf to the work of
the Goſpel; for if ſuch a courſe be not to be taken, as is
before mentioned, for the approving of men for the work
and maintenance, then the conſequence is clear in the ſence
of Mr <hi>G.</hi> that the Magiſtrate is bound to maintain them,
whatever their Qualifications and Deſigns be, rather then
leave them (as Mr <hi>G.</hi> hath expreſſed the matter with much
compaſſion) to the doom of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> to be <hi>fed with the
bread of affliction, and water of affliction, or to ſuffer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and cold, and nakedneſs, and all extremity, if God will not
look after them, and provide better than ſo for them.</hi> A ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
man (you ſee) he is, that neither erroneous, ignorant,
nor prophane perſons ſhould want if they will but preach,
and that there ſhould be no care at all taken by the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52973:44"/>
Magiſtrate, but rather that he ſhould diſtribute his Bread at
random, for fear leſt <hi>pretending Goſpellers</hi> ſhould be ſtarved
out of their deſigns and projects, uſually laid to propagate
their own ends and opinions by infecting the people. This
is the ſum of the charitable part of his Argument. Then,
as to the politick and prudential part, whereas he tells us,
that as the impowering of the Commiſſioners is <hi>of a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
tendencie to beget in them a ſpirit of inſolencie and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
over other men, ſo in the party oppreſſed a ſpirit of
diſcontent, diſaffection, &amp;c: the occaſioning whereof he looks
on as moſt impolitick.</hi> But certainly, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his <hi>Politicks</hi>
have very little of Divinity, that in his Commonwealth he
would not have the Magiſtrate diſcharge his Conſcience in
reſpect to the Particular before-expreſſed; and all (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)
becauſe it may work up a ſuppoſed ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
and diſaffection among ſome in the Nation. This
profound man may do well rather to conſider what it is
that is the true Cauſe why there are ſo many ſpirits up
abroad, not only of diſcontent and diſaffection, but alſo of
Faction among the People. Have they not been conjured
up by men of his own looſe temper, that would not allow
the Magiſtrate the leaſt power to make uſe of his Intereſt
and Authority for the promoting of the Goſpel, nor of his
own Underſtanding and Diſcretion for the ordering of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in ſuch a manner as might be for the encouraging of
ſound Preachers, and the diſcountenancing of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
minds, and of aery Fanatick Notions? How many of
this ſort of Teachers have we lately ſeen (under pretence of
zeal and high devotion) openly ſacrificing the Truths of
God, and the Affairs of Religion, to ſerve and advance
ſome ſmall Deſign, or petty Party, while their Hearers
have had their perſons in admiration becauſe of advantage,
<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe too many of them thereby came to get well;
which others ſeeing, have ſtricken in the ſame way, till the
number of the Party encreaſing, they have been able to let
the Magiſtrate underſtand by dumb ſigns, and an active
temper, that he ought to remember them in good time, or
elſe he may hazard the high diſpleaſure of a formidable
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52973:45"/>
Faction? How often hath the preſent Authority been put
to a ſtand by ſuch Demagogues, who have abuſed the
Pulpit, and the Ordinances of God, to make them ſerve their
purpoſes by bidding defiance to all Rule and Authority?
And how many are there abroad ſtill upon the ſame deſign?
and it's not impoſſible but Mr. <hi>G.</hi> may ſtrike in among them.
Doubtleſs, he will deſerve to be a principal man with them,
if he can but perfect what he hath begun, to level the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
and lay the Publick Maintenance in Common
for all ſorts of Stray-Cattel to enter, and by that means be
enabled to lead the people out of the way, to the diſturbance
of the Commonwealth, and their own deſtruction. By this
you may apprehend the more than probable effect and
tendencie of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his Charity and Policie; which being
laid in the ſcales with the wiſdom and liberality of our
Superiors, in reference to the Particular under queſtion,
the judicious Reader is left to turn them at his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
Only, for a Farewell, let me have leave to tell
Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> That theſe and the like Concluſions of his
may ſtand well in tune with the Policie and Principles of
his Brother <hi>Williams,</hi> though indeed Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath more
policie then to vent them with the ſame plainneſs: For,
Mr. <hi>Roger Williams</hi> ſpeaks out with a full mouth in a Book
of his printed <hi>Anno 1652. pag. 24. I humbly conceive</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>that the great duty of the Magiſtrate as to Spirituals
will turn upon theſe two hinges. 1. In removing the Civil
bars, &amp;c. the paiment of Tythes, and the maintenance of
Miniſters, &amp;c 2. In a free and abſolute permiſſion of the
Conſciences of all men in what is meerly ſpiritual; not the
very Conſciences of the Jews, nor the Conſciences of the Turks,
or Papiſts, or Pagans themſelves excepted.</hi> By Conſcience
he doth not mean the Faith a man hath to himſelf, but a
Liberty to profeſs, and teach others accordingly: And
indeed, this is the natural conſequence, and the very Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
of this Ninth Argument of Mr. <hi>Goodwin's;</hi> and
he may as well cloſe with Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> in the full latitude of
every point: For the ſame Gentleman in the Book before-mentioned,
ſaith, <hi>If a world of</hi> Arrians <hi>deny the Deity of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52973:45"/>
Chriſt Jeſus; if a</hi> Manichee <hi>his Humane nature; if the</hi> Jews
<hi>deny both, and blaſphemouſly call our Chriſt a Deceiver;
nay, if the</hi> Mahumetans, <hi>the</hi> Turks <hi>prefer their cheating</hi>
Mahomet <hi>before him: What now? muſt we cry out Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers!
Hereticks! &amp;c.? Muſt we run to Cities or Senates,
and cry, Help you Magiſtrates! Or, muſt we flie up to
Heaven by Prayer?</hi>—This is a brave Latitude indeed;
and there being elbow-room enough, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and he
muſt needs ſhake hands, if he means to maintain this his
Ninth Argument. And ſo I leave them together.</p>

The ſum of the ſtory in ſhort is this; For he ſpeaks
out now, and tells us at large why he is ſo virulent angry
at his Highneſs and the Council, and the Commiſſioners;
even for no other cauſe, but that neither maintenance nor
countenance is like to be given to ſuch as are tainted with
his ſpurious, heterodoxal, pſeudo-theological Phant'ſies.</hi>

               <p>Before I make Reply to the Main, let the Reader ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

a meer Civill Act and Proviſion. But to proceed;</p>
               <p>It is not a Buſineſs proper upon the preſent occaſion, to

not in a Univerſal ſence, as if all men were ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into ſuch a State, that they may ſave themſelves if they
will. 2. That ſeeing from all eternity God was pleaſed to
take ſome (as it were) out of the lump and common maſs of
Mankind, and deſign them to become veſſels of honor, and
leave others as veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
queſtionles there are a ſort of particular perſons, whom
he never loved in Chriſt, &amp; ſo conſequently are concluded
under a ſtate of Reprobation. 3. That he doth vouchſafe a
ſufficiency of means to all men to repent, and beleeve; but
not ſo, that the means ſhould be ſo far in their own power,
that they ſhould be able to beleeve and repent when it
pleaſeth themſelves. Laſtly, That he neither conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52973:46"/>
nor neceſſitateth any man to beleeve, or be ſaved;
yet having by the power of his own Spirit ſo wrought
and framed the heart of a man, that it becomes pliant
to the purpoſe of his grace, then the heart is of it ſelf
induced and diſpoſed, not conſtrained to beleeve, and by
the ſame power of the Spirit is enabled to perſevere in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
being ſuſtained by continual ſupplies of Grace,
(through the Spirit) from Chriſt, by vertue of the union
with him through faith, ſo that they cannot make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of Faith and a good Conſcience, ſo far as to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;
foraſmuch as being the Sons of God, they are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

his mighty power to Salvation.</q> Now whereas Mr <hi>G.</hi> is
pleaſed to underſtand theſe great and important Truths,
and the other which depend upon them, not in the ſame
genuine ſence that the Scriptures hold them forth, but
hath ſet the whole Canon of Scripture upon the Rack
to extort another meaning from them than was in all
times confeſſed by the precious Saints of God in all the
Churches, I muſt needs make bold to brand his Tenets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

before he comes to the end of his rambling! Theſe
are Doctrines that would make a tender Conſcience melt,
and tremble at hearing them. No wonder then if the
Commiſſioners be ſtartled, and think it concerns them to
do what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> chargeth upon them here in this Argument
of his as a Crime; which is (as he is pleaſed to expreſs it)
<hi>to dive as far and as deep as they know, into the Judgments of
thoſe that come before them, to diſcover whether there be not
ſome Touch or Tincture (at leaſt) of ſome propenſion of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
towards thoſe Opinions;</hi> thoſe Opinions, I ſay, which
draw ſuch a horrible Train of Abſurdities after them, as
directly tend to the utter ſubverting of the Doctrine of the
Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſaith, The Commiſſioners lay ſnares and
ſtumbling Blocks in the way of the Young men of theſe
Opinions, becauſe when they come before them to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52973:48"/>
they are put to this <hi>Dilemma</hi> either to loſe the hopes
of their Preferment, or get through by diſſembling their
Opinions; As many of them have done, if their own Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
may be credited; They will tell you of many through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>England,</hi> and more than two or three now in <hi>London,</hi>
that have gone through this Teſt. By ſuch diſſimulation it
muſt needs be, or elſe the Commiſſioners deſerve not to be
blamed by you for being ſo over-ſtrict. But what do you
infer from this wild Aſſertion? even as wild a Concluſion.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> It is unchriſtian for the Commiſſioners to ſift them
touching thoſe Opinions: And they (forſooth) who lay
<hi>ſuch a ſtumbling-block as this in the way of their Brethren
will not</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>eſcape the revenging hand of God more than</hi>
Balaam <hi>did, who taught</hi> Balack <hi>to caſt a ſtumbling block
before the Children of Iſrael.</hi> This is like leaping over
Blocks, and a running over Hedge and Ditch in matter
of Argumentation, as if <hi>Balaam</hi> were alive again and had
bewitched him: Certainly if <hi>Balaam's</hi> Beaſt ſhould revive,
and recover the uſe of his Tongue, he would frame ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more like an Argument then this, or elſe he would
deſerve his Maſters cudgel. But theſe things we muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
for the old <hi>Man-and-Boy</hi> is very angry on the behalf
of thoſe his Sons, whom he hath begotten through his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting

                  </gap>ſ-ſervice both unto
God and men. But ſuch are the perſons, at leaſt the far greater
part of them (and ſuch they were before their Intruſtment)
who by the Commiſſions aforeſaid, are made the authorized
Judges of the judgments of all the publick Miniſters of the
Nation, though they are and were (in reſpect of their Spirit,
Principles, and Tenets) not only like to preſume and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to preſcribe unto God and Jeſus Chriſt, who, and what
manner of Perſons, they ſhould do well to employ in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Miniſtry, and again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who and what manner of perſons,
it would be expedient for them to reject and put by from that
employment; but, further, more generally to recommend and
order unto them (that I ſay not, obtrude upon them) for the

they (God I mean, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> and the Lord Chriſt) do recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
daily and providentially ſend unto them for their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and yet are diſallowed and rejected by them.</p>
               <p>Well ſaid Mr. <hi>G.</hi> If theſe things be ſo, they in Authority
have great reaſon to ken you thanks (Sir) for the diſcovery;
but had ill luck they had not ſo foreſeeing a Politician to
adviſe with in the Council, becauſe you (it ſeems) like a
wiſe <hi>Aruſpex,</hi> are able to make an inſpection into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and from thence collect a Judgment: You
(it ſeems) could beforehand have acquainted them with
the hearts of thoſe whom they choſe to be Commiſſioners,
and told them, before the Inſtrument, what a ſort of men
they were like to prove. Indeed, it was a mighty overſight,
that you were not adviſed with about the Choice of them;
then doubtleſs the Ordinances or Commiſſions had been
good, and all would have been well, had the Commiſſioners
been of your own grave Opinion and Appointment. In
the mean time, the Commiſſioners are ſuch as are all well
known to the people of God throughout the Nations; and
if they were not, yet it is Argument enough on their behalf,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52973:49"/>
that they were thought fit to be entruſted by a Prince and
his Council, moſt renowned for piety throughout the
Reformed Churches; and it is not the leaſt part of their
vindication, that your Greatneſs hath been pleaſed to caſt
ſo many Revilings and Reproaches upon them, which
(knowing who, and what you are) they are willing to
wear as Garlands and Crowns of honor about their
heads.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> would ſeem to have ſome Reaſon for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt them, becauſe he ſaith they take upon
them <hi>to preſcribe unto God and Jeſus Chriſt who and what
manner of perſons THEY ſhould do well to imploy in the
work of the Miniſtry, and whom to reject; and to obtrude
others upon THEM,</hi> viz <hi>upon God, and the Lord Chriſt,
who are leſs able and fit for this work.</hi> This is the ſum of the
buſineſs; wherein I cannot but take notice of the manner
of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his expreſſion in theſe words, [<hi>God, and the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt</hi>] They (in the plural) being twice repeated at
length, as if he intended ſome more then ordinary <hi>Emphaſis</hi>
thereby. I ſhall not make a buſineſs of it to inſiſt further
upon the Expreſſion; nor ſhould I have ſtood ſtill at it by
the way, if any other kind of man had uſed it: But when
I conſider who penned it, and how he hath dipt himſelf in
other deſperate Opinions and Phant'ſies, a little matter
may give an occaſion to fear leſt he be ready to take ſome
other new Vagary (being already upon the way) and run
over to <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> with the reſt of his Brother-Wits,
whoſe ambition it was to have their Names ſtand
upon Record, as the great Maſters of Reaſon in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of Religion. But to the buſineſs in hand.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſaith, The Commiſſioners <hi>preſcribe unto God</hi>
whom he ſhould employ in the work of the Miniſtry, and
whom he ſhould reject, and <hi>obtrude others upon him</hi> who
are leſſe able; he gives us no more for the proof of this
than of the reſt of his Arguments. The Commiſſioners
are ſo far from preſcribing unto God, that they follow
the preſcript of Gods Word in employing or rejecting
men, and make that their Rule, the Rules given them by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52973:49"/>
our Governors in the two Ordinances being all either ſet
down in, or derived from and grounded upon the Word by
neceſſary and undeniable Conſequence, as is evident to any
man that doth but read the Particulars enumerated in the
Ordinances: And you may be ſure it is ſo; otherwiſe Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
being ſtreightned in his Arguments for want of real and
ſolid matter againſt the Commiſſioners and their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
would have taken occaſion to enlarge himſelf upon
them all, rather than have recourſe (as he hath done all
along) to feeble and groundleſs Allegations of Falſhood
and Scandal, to fortifie himſelf in his deſign againſt them.
But the Commiſſioners are (he ſaith) to blame for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
men that are leſs competent, and diſallowing others
<hi>whom God and Chriſt do recommend unto them for appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
and who are more competent for the work of the Goſpel.</hi>
But who are thoſe whom God recommends as more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent?
Even thoſe perſons, he tells us, <hi>who are qualified
to teach the juſt compaſs and extent of the grace of God in the
death and Goſpel of his Son.</hi> That is to ſay, thoſe who teach
the extent of the grace of God in the death of Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ſenſe, juſt as he himſelf hath calculated it for
the Meridian of <hi>Coleman-ſtreet,</hi> yet ſo as that the Influence
of it may (in his conceit) indifferently ſerve for all the ſons
of <hi>Adam</hi> without diſtinction throughout the world; which
is indeed of ſuch an extent and compaſs, that it will ſtretch
any mans brains, and the whole Scripture too, (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
very well knoweth) to bring the grace of God to ſuch a
latitude, as that it ſhall reach to all men alike. They that
can do this, are not only men of competent, but reaching
Parts and Pates indeed; and a pleaſing Doctrine it is to
the carnal part of the world, who thereupon preſuming
that it is in the power of their own Wills to return and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and lay hold (at any time when themſelves pleaſe)
upon the grace of God, are by ſuch doctrine encouraged
to make uſe of their young days at their own liberty, and
to ſtretch their Conſciences to the full compaſs and extent
of their own luſts, having this comfortable Reſerve within
their thoughts, That they can leave it off when they are old,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52973:50"/>
and take their own time to think of Chriſt (having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in his death already) and grow better at leiſure;
and (having the word of ſo reverend and learned a
Preacher as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to bear them out) that it muſt be their
own fault, if for all this they do miſcarry in the buſineſs.
This doctrine is of a brave latitude indeed, it including vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
as the Root, all the Fruits of Ungodlineſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
that break forth into the world: For, when
men grow audacious and continue in the commiſſion of
ſins, it is generally upon this account, that by ſome ſecret
ſuggeſtion of Satan and their own corrupt hearts, they are
induced to flatter themſelves thus, that they will mend and
do otherwiſe ere long, thereby poſting off repentance from
time to time, upon a vain ſuppoſition, that Redemption by
the blood of Chriſt is ſo comprehenſive and of ſuch a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that all men are intereſted therein alike; ſo that the
work being done on Chriſts part already, there remains
nothing now on their part, but to claim an intereſt in it,
which they can do a year or two, or ſeven, or twenty, forty
years hence, as well as now, ſeeing there wants nothing
but their own good will to the buſineſs; and rather than
be wanting in that, they can ſet their Wills on work when
they will themſelves, unleſs you can imagine they would be
ſo fooliſh as to neglect their own ſalvation, and tumble
voluntarily into hell when it is in their own power to avoid
it. This is a Doctrine of a rare Extent indeed, that fetcheth
all manner of wickedneſſes (more or leſs) into the world:
It helps to people <hi>Bridewell,</hi> ſtock <hi>Newgate,</hi> and feed <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi>
under the protection and inſtruction of the Pens and
Pulpits of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and thoſe more competent Sons of his
whom he baptizeth into that wretched Opinion of the
Univerſal extent of Redemption, (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Benefits of
the death of Chriſt) to all the world, to wit, every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
perſon. And therefore certainly, the Magiſtrate
and the Commiſſioners for Approbation cannot chuſe but
conceive it much concerns them to aſſign maintenance to
men on purpoſe to propagate it, and the other attendant
Phant'ſies, by preaching for the encouragement, exceeding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52973:50"/>
conſolation and conveniencie of all the impious, diſſolute,
and profane perſons in the world: Eſpecially Mr. <hi>G.</hi> having
paſſed his word, that they are Preachers of Gods own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.
And ſo I leave this commendable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
paſſing on to the Twelfth.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="argument">
               <head>ARGUMENT XII.</head>
               <p>THe Twelfth is nothing elſe but a Repetition of the
Plea on the behalf of Patrons,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument.</note> as if he meant meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to purchaſe their good will towards himſelf and men
of his own opinion. For, ſaith he, <hi>In caſe a man be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
in the great Doctrines of Vniverſal Atonements by Chriſt,
of Conditional Perſeverance, and the reſt of the ſame Band of
Aſſociation, and a Patron ſhould preſent ſuch a one to the
Commiſſioners for Approbation, as a man whom in conſcience
he conceives be ought to preſent, and that it were unlawful for
him to preſent any man otherwiſe minded, and hereupon the
Commiſſioners diſapprove him;</hi> by this means he inſinuates,
<hi>that the Pariſh comes to ſuffer prejudice for want of a Miniſter
the ſpace of ſix moneths, and at the ſix moneths end the Patron
becomes non-ſuited of his priviledge of Preſentation; and ſo
ſome Favourite of the Times wearing Black, in ſtead of a
Miniſter, comes to be thruſt upon the Pariſh, or elſe they muſt
remain ſpiritually waſte and deſolate.</hi> This is the ſum of the
Argument, which being put in the balance, is of the ſame
weight with the reſt. As for the Doctrine of <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Atonement,</hi> and the reſt of the black Guard of Errors
which follow it at the heels, it ſeems to be of the ſame nature
with the <hi>Tail of the Dragon,</hi> mentioned <hi>Rev. 12. which drew
down the third part of the ſtars of heaven, and caſt them to the
earth.</hi> For, more than a third part of thoſe glorious Truths
of the Goſpel, which ſhine as ſo many ſtars in the eyes of
all, except thoſe who are held in chains of intereſt, or of
darkneſs and deluſion, are (ſo far as Satan's power can
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52973:51"/>
prevail) drawn out of the Firmament of the Church, and
caſt upon the Earth by that corrupt Doctrine, and the
whole Train of Conſequential Abſurdities hanging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
And yet, for the ſake of this Doctrine (you ſee) it is,
and becauſe the Magiſtrate ſeeth no reaſon to countenance
and maintain it, that all this ſtorm is raiſed againſt the
Commiſſioners. Otherwiſe, we had never heard Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
make a needleſs Plea on the behalf of Patrons, and ſuch
perſons and Pariſhes as have power of Preſentation; for
they ſtill enjoy that power notwithſtanding the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.
But we know he wants matter to fill up the pages,
and ſo any thing ſhall be foiſted in that may be an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſaying ſomewhat, though to no purpoſe, againſt the
<hi>Commiſſioners.</hi> And therefore upon this ground it is, that
(wanting other materials) he falls to beſpattering them
and the preſent Authority, under pretence of pleading for
Patrons and Pariſhes, whereas there was never yet any
ſuch injury done, as might either defeat any Patron of his
Right, or prejudice any Pariſh for want of a Preacher, or
force any <hi>Favorite in Black</hi> upon them. <hi>Sir,</hi> Be perſwaded
even to give over this black work of ſcandalizing your
Superiors and your Brethren; it would be more ſuitable
for a dying man to exerciſe himſelf in ſome better devotion
than to be ſcribling thus inſtead of arguing; and not make
good any thing by Inſtance, or otherwiſe: You were never
right for the Polemical part of Divinity, and never worſe
than now. 'Tis ſomewhat too nimble a work for an old
man; the gauderies of a little rambling Rhetorick will not
ſerve to dreſs out ſuch a diſcourſe; and therefore 'twere
high time you would end your days with repenting and
praying (you have cauſe and work enough of that nature
before you, if you reflect upon what is paſt) and not ſpin
out the ſmall Remainder in reproaching your ſelf and
others.</p>

preſumed to correct and inſtruct his and our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
in points of Civil and Chriſtian Policy, (and that
very gravely, as he not humbly conceives) he now comes to
produce a Maxim of State to convince them of their Error;

whereof is this, That <hi>No Power is Truſty, if it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great;</hi>

<hi>an unlimited exorbitant power, of the ſame houſe and lineage

the death of Chriſt, &amp;c.) the door of preferment is
ſhut up againſt him.</hi> This is a ſtout Argument indeed,
and if rightly ſtated, the force of it would amount to this;
The Commiſſioners cannot approve of men that are of
the <hi>Goodwinian</hi> miſerable Foundation-deſtroying doctrine
concerning <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation, &amp;c.</hi> nor judge them
fit to be owned by the Magiſtrate in a way of maintenance,
according to ſuch Rules as the Magiſtrate himſelf hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them to judge by; <hi>Ergo</hi> they do as the Pope doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
hold themſelves to be infallible. A man might from this
rather infer this Conſequence, That they do not conceive
themſelves infallible, becauſe they are willing to judge as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52973:52"/>
the Magiſtrate directs them, and that Mr <hi>G</hi> conceiveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
infallible, implying as if the Commiſſioners were bound
to follow his judgment, and make that their Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to try and approve men, rather than by thoſe Rules and
Directions which have been given them by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
Here (it ſeems) lieth the core of all the evill, and
the Occaſion of all this Rancor, that the Commiſſioners
are not (<hi>hujus jurati in verba Magiſtri</hi>) ſworn to follow
this great Maſter, and to approve ſuch men as have ſhaken
hands with him in the bearing up of that Un-evangelical
Opinion, againſt Gods electing love in Chriſt, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
whereof, he would compaſs even Sea and Land to
make a Proſelite. 2. Whereas he inſinuateth, that the
Commiſſioners are as lawleſs as the Pope, <hi>becauſe none may
queſtion or judge of them, and becauſe they will approve of
none but thoſe that will wonder after their Learning and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets;</hi>
and though he divides theſe Particulars under a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third head, as if they were diſtinct, and this on
purpoſe to make his Pamphlet ſwell, yet this ſhort Reply
may ſerve in return to both his hold and frothy Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
how is it poſſible that the Commiſſioners ſhould
be accounted lawleſs in their proceedings as the Pope is,
when as it is known (and Mr. <hi>G.</hi> himſelf here hath ſaid it)
that the Pope makes himſelf above all Law and Power that
is without himſelf? and hereupon by vertue of ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Autocraſie,</hi> as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> taketh to himſelf upon all
occaſions, he proceeds in the ſame manner as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
conſtantly doth; what he doth by his Bulls, Mr <hi>G.</hi> doth by
his Pen and Pamphlets, who takes upon him at pleaſure to
control, cenſure and defie Acts of the Civil Power, and
doth what in him lies by reproaches and ſcandals almoſt
to Anathematize them, and to diſſolve the bond of the
Subjects obedience, by rendring the Government odious
and contemptible, and to overthrow it by ſtirring up. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and Factions among the People; and all this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
becauſe he cannot impoſe upon his Highneſs and the
Councel in matter of Faith, ſo as to make them the publick
Patrons and Promoters of his private Opinion; if this be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52973:52"/>
not Papal, I know not what is: But now, the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
are ſo far from imitating him and the Pope, in any
of their lawleſs humours, that they in their proceedings are
under the Law and direction of another, <hi>Viz.</hi> the preſent
Authority, and can do neither more nor leſſe than what the
ſame Authority hath by a Law preſcribed them; if they
ſhould, Mr <hi>G.</hi> knows by experience Authority is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to hear a complaint, and that Law doth not enable
them to ſet men a wondring after their Learning and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets;
for what Tenets or Opinions ſoever in points of the
leſſer importance may be among themſelves, they are not
to eſtimate, nor do they meaſure a Judgement concerning
any man according to them, nor do they diſ-approve any
men becauſe of their opinions, provided they be not of the
<hi>Goodwinian</hi> ſtrain before-mentioned, <hi>Errores in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus,</hi>
which tend to a rending of that very Foundation
which was laid upon the Prophets and Apoſtles, and a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of the glorious ſuper-ſtructure of all the main truths
which are built thereupon. Moreover, there is not the leaſt
affinity between the Popes power and theirs: For the Pope
arrogates to himſelf a power in the Church, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of being the ſole Deputie or Commiſſioner for the
Government of it under Jeſus Chriſt, and thereupon ſtileth
himſelf his Vicar; but the Commiſſioners have neither aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
any power to themſelves, it being a matter intruſted
to them, nor is it derived to them in any ſuch way as from
Chriſt, much leſſe from him in order to Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but they have received it in truſt from the Magiſtrate,
whoſe Deputies they are, to a civil end and purpoſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> to
ſee that the publick State-Maintenance, allowed for the
Preaching of the Goſpel to the people, may be diſpoſed of
according to the Magiſtrates own appointment and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
in any of which reſpects there is not the leaſt
reſemblance betwixt the Popes tranſcendent ſpiritual, and
their limited temporal Power; and therefore Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
hath not injured them ſo much as himſelf, who though his
Biſhoprick be not very large, might a great deal ſooner be
taken for the Pope (as appears) in all his actings. The reſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52973:53"/>
of this pretended Argument is a mere idle repetition of
Scandals, and of other matter already refuted. It's a ſad
thing to ſee a man of his garb and grave pretence, ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
in Aſperſions throughout his Pamphlet, and yet not
make ſo much as an Inſtance to prove any one Particular.</p>

               <head>ARGUMENT XIV.</head>
               <p>THe Fourteenth I find to be only a quaint piece of Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie
flouriſhed over with a new dreſs:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his 14th Argument.</note> For, abſtract
the Rhetorical levities, and there remains nothing but the

which he brings in here as an Auxiliary to the other,
doth but help to make him and his deſign the more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
For, whereas he tells us again, that <hi>the Goſpel ſtands
in no need of any Commiſſion or Conſtitution of humane device
and contrivance to carry on the intereſt of it in the world, but
that Chriſt hath left Rules and Directions in perſpicuous terms
in the Goſpel, ſufficient to render the ſtate of the Goſpel flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and proſperous, ſo as not to leave ſo important an affair to
the care and management, and contrivance of the Secular
Powers;</hi> I ſhall not make repetition of any thing that I
have diſcourſed before to anſwer this, but refer the Reader
to be ſatisfied at large in the former part of the Book, where
I have fully anſwered his other Arguments relating to this
particular. Only I ſhall examine what he offers more to
prove that Chriſt hath left perſpicuous Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
in all Circumſtances, for the promoting of the
Goſpel, ſo as that the Magiſtrate ought not to deviſe or
contrive any thing in order to the ſetting forward of that
good work. But alas, among all thoſe pretended perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rules and Directions, his perſpicacious eye hath not
been able yet to find out and afford us ſo much as one
(which might eaſily have been done, had there been any
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52973:53"/>
ſuch) but in ſtead of that he brings in a Text by head and
ſhoulders, and offers it as ſuch a Rule. The words are theſe;
<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 9 38. Luc. 10. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harveſt, that he will ſend
forth laborers into his harveſt.</hi> Well; but what doth he infer
from this? 1. <hi>Ergo, Laborers ſent or thruſt forth, will, with
Gods ordinary bleſſing upon their labors, advance the intereſt
of the Goſpel among men; elſe, why did Chriſt pray for their
ſending forth?</hi> 2. From the words, <hi>Pray ye,</hi> he inferreth,
<hi>That Chriſt preſcribed no other</hi> (and conſequently, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his ſenſe and ſcope it muſt be, that uſe ought to be
made of no other) <hi>courſe or means for the obtaining this
high favor from God, but Prayer only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to theſe (after a ſmile or two, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the rare ingenie of this reaching Commentator)
give me leave to wonder a little at the confidence of the
man, that his gravity ſhould have time to trifle thus in ſo
ſerious a buſineſs. 1. As to the firſt Inference, It is not
to be denied, That the ſending forth of Laborers, and Gods
ordinary bleſſing upon their labors, will advance the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of the Goſpel among men: But what is this to the point
in hand? Surely, it cannot be concluded hence, becauſe
Chriſt would have Laborers ſent out, therefore they ſhould
not, before they are ſent abroad, be tryed and examined
whether they be fit for ſo high and bleſſed a labor or work,
for which few among many Pretenders are found ſufficient;
as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Or that the
Magiſtrate, or any other, ought not to take a convenient
courſe for their Tryall and Approbation; but leave all to
goe that gape for publick maintenance, or that in caſe he
ſhould take a courſe, it ought to be looked upon as an
humane invention and contrivance, derogatory to the
wiſdom of Chriſt: Till Mr. <hi>G.</hi> be able rationally to draw
ſuch Concluſions as theſe from that Text, he might have
ſpared the labor of citing it to no purpoſe. 2. As to
his ſecond Inference drawn from the words, <hi>Pray ye;</hi>
it is readily acknowledged, that Prayer is an excellent
means to procure that great Bleſſing of the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Goſpel by the hands of ſuch Laborers as are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52973:54"/>
ſent abroad: But is it thence to be concluded, that becauſe
Chriſt in this Text ſpeaks of no other means but Prayer,
therefore he recommended Prayer excluſively, ſo that no
other courſe ought to be taken for the promotion of the
Goſpel but only Prayer? Mr. <hi>G.</hi> might as well ſay, when
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Pray ye that ye enter not into temptation,</hi> that
we need only to pray, and do no more, not do ſo much as
to uſe wiſdom and diſcretion for the avoiding of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note> nor have recourſe to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> remedy, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for
the crucifying of thoſe luſts, or the mortifying of thoſe
earthly members, which diſpoſe us to the entertaining of
temptations. Prayer is indeed a general means ordained
for the procuring of Bleſſings upon all Occaſions: And
therefore when he ſent forth the Seventy Diſciples to
preach, and bade them pray for more Labourers in the
Lords vineyard, I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>G.</hi> will not undertake to
prove that Chriſts intent therein was, that they ſhould only
pray, and not uſe the leaſt point of induſtry or diſcretion
(as occaſion offer'd it ſelf) for augmenting the number
of Laborers. But till he be able to make that good, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee how we can admit, that Chriſts commanding his
Diſciples to pray upon that occaſion, is ſuch an Inſtitution
for propagating the Goſpel, as that it excludes the uſe of
ordinary prudent means or endeavour (as in other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions) on the part of the Magiſtrate, or any other,
upon any occaſion whatſoever. Certainly if we are bound
to pray that Laborers may be ſent forth, it clearly implieth
alſo, that utmoſt endeavour in all other ways and means
ſhould be uſed, as well as Prayer, for the ſending of them
forth fitly qualified. And ſo this Text being rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
makes rather for, than againſt the care and means
which is and ought to be exerciſed in all Chriſtian Common-wealths
in upholding Univerſities the Schools of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Proviſion of liberal maintenance, that they which ſo
labour, and are worthy, may have their reward, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 18. And that this, or the like courſe be
taken, that ſuch Laborers or Workmen be ſent forth, as
the Magiſtrate need not be aſhamed of, and ſo ably dividing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52973:54"/>
the Word of Truth, that themſelves need not be aſhamed;
according as it is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15.
Unleſs perhaps Mr. <hi>G.</hi> will ſay, that we may pray for a thing,
and yet uſe no other means to attain it. But if he have not
forgotten all his School-boy-Learning, there is a Fable in
<hi>Eſop</hi> that will better inſtruct him, where the diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Jupiter</hi> and the <hi>Carter</hi> will ſhew him, that if the wain
be in the ditch, 'tis in vain for the Carter to lie on his back,
and pray for help, without ſetting his ſhoulder to the work
of heaving it out. Whereſoever God directs man to the
purſuing of an end, it is ever implied that man ought to uſe
all means which in right reaſon are conducible, if he will
attain thereto. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is the firſt man I have heard of that
ſcruples at this matter; this Soveraign Penman, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<hi>Pen-and-Inkhorn-Prince,</hi> may preſume to do any thing
in print. But if ever he appear in print again, he may do
well to ſet out his new Art of Logick, that the world may
not want an Inſtrument to fetch any thing from Scripture,
and make lucky Concluſions.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, as if he thought this Text would but
little avail him againſt the preſent Authority and their
Commiſſioners, he hath recourſe again to his old refuge,
and raiſeth a new Battery of Slander to ſhoot his bitter
arrows at them; ſaying, <hi>They are ſo far from being Co-workers
with God in thruſting forth Laborers, that they
are rather Counterworkers, thrusting thoſe back whom God
thruſts forward, and thrusting loiterers and unworthy men
upon him in their ſtead.</hi> Here are the Plague-tokens of Envy;
but where is the Proof? Alas, that is reſerved for ſome
other ſeaſon; in the mean time it ſerves his turn well
enough to chime and gingle upon theſe words, <hi>Co-workers</hi>
and <hi>Counter-workers, thruſting forward and thruſting back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
in and out, Laborers and Loiterers;</hi> knicking and
knacking it with ſuch kind of Knacks and Play-games as
make a ratling noiſe in Rhetorick, to pleaſe childiſh fancie;
but what are theſe things to men of ſolidity and ſobriety,
that would inform their underſtandings? But 'tis all one
with him; he is every jot as light and toyiſh alſo in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52973:55"/>
managing matter of Argument. And this appears by his
trifling with another Scripture, which he hath drawn in
(I know not how) to prove, that Chriſt hath left Rules
enough of ſuch a nature, as there needs no help of any
prudence to promote the preaching of the Goſpel. But
what, trow ye, is the proof? Even ſuch another Text, ſave
only it makes leſs (if that were poſſible) to his purpoſe than
the former. It is <hi>Luk. 12. 49. I am come to ſend fire on the
earth, and what will I if it be already kindled?</hi> This, he tells
us, ſignifieth, <hi>that Chriſt deſired nothing in this world (at
leaſt comparatively) before his departure from it, but only to
ſee that fire kindled which he came to ſend on the earth, that
is, to ſee the Goſpel (as it were) to have gotten footing, and
taken ſome hold in the world.</hi> Well; admit this be the right
interpretation, what doth he infer from it? <hi>Ergo, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Lord Chriſt, who was deſirous to ſee this, was ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and provident enough by himſelf, or by his Apoſtles (at
least) to order and enjoin all things neceſſary or meet, for
the ſpreading of the Goſpel, upon terms of the beſt advantage
after him, and not to leave ſo important an affair to the care
and contrivance of the Secular Powers.</hi> Doubtleſs, while
Chriſt and his Apoſtles were upon the earth, they neglected
not to order things which were then neceſſary and meet
for the then ſpreading of the Goſpel. So much of Inference
may be admitted: But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſtretcheth it further, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
from this Text what it never intended to import.
His Argument ſtands thus: Chriſts great deſire was, while
he was on earth, to ſee the fire of the Goſpel kindled; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
He by himſelf, or his Apoſtles, laid down ſuch Rules and
Directions ſo full in all circumſtances, that the Magiſtrate
hath no liberty left to uſe his diſcretion for the kindling or
promoting of it (upon any occaſion) in After-Ages. I ſhall
not now reſume the debate whether there are ſuch large
Rules and Directions to be found, or whether the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
may exert his Civil power and wiſdom, to ſettle any
Courſe upon a Civil Account for the publication of the
Goſpel, (the former part of this Diſcourſe having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
cleared the Truth already concerning thoſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52973:55"/>
but the matter under queſtion here is this, whether
from ſuch an <hi>Antecedent</hi> as this, <hi>That Chriſt deſired to ſee
the Goſpel take footing while he lived,</hi> any ſuch Conſequence
as this do naturally &amp; clearly follow; <hi>Therfore he by himſelf,
or his Apoſtles, left ſuch univerſal Rules to promote it, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all endeavour and care of the Magiſtrate from aſſiſting
thereunto in ſucceeding times and generations.</hi> It muſt be
a rare Logical Engine that can ſerue in ſuch a Conſequence
without the mighty help of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> who ſeems to have an
extraordinary faculty of tormenting his own Brains, and
the Scripture, to bring about ſhadowie pretences of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Religion, to cover the peeviſh deſigns and odd
purpoſes of an angry ſpleen.</p>
               <p>But he goeth on to tell us, <hi>Experience hath manifeſted in
all Ages, that for men, whoever they be, to compound the
wiſdom, counſels, and inſtitutions of Chriſt, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Goſpel in the world with their own devices
and Inventions, is the next way to obſtruct the courſe of the
Goſpel. And yet the profeſſing powers of this world have
always had itching deſires to be officious unto Chriſt in this
kind, to obtrude upon him their own Projections and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to accommodate and help him through the world with
his worſhip and Goſpel.</hi> It is readily granted, that the
Civil Powers of the world have been too much engaged
in mingling their own Inventions with the Inſtitutions of
Chriſt, and Goſpel-worſhip, which hath been the great
hindrance to a progreſs of the Goſpel in the Truth and
Power of it. But why is this brought in here to be inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
againſt the Civil Powers now in <hi>England?</hi> and why
is ſuch a heap of words erouded in here to incumber the
Reader, and countenance the Inſinuation? Certainly Mr.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> cannot charge the preſent Governors for mingling
their own Inventions with the Inſtitutions and Worſhip of
Chriſt. Could he have done it, we ſhould have ſeen him
deſcending to particulars to prove the charge, and have
heard of him in a more lofty tune; but knowing in his
Conſcience there is no ſuch matter, it ſerveth his turn well
enough, by packing and ſhuffling a company of words to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52973:56"/>
thereby ſlily to cheat, and inſtill an ill Opinion of
the preſent Authority, into the unwary Reader, as if they
compounded their own Inventions with Goſpel-worſhip
and Inſtitutions. But take away the Boxes, and then what
becomes of the Jugler? Remove the <hi>deceptio viſus, Viz.</hi>
the Miſt of words from before the eyes of the Reader,
and then Mr <hi>G.</hi> his tricks and ſlights of Inſinuation ſignifie
nothing at all to the meaneſt underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Ordinances for <hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Ejection</hi> made by
his Highneſs and the Councel are the preſent Subject of
this bold mans diſcourſe; and therefore we are to ſuppoſe
his meaning is, that by thoſe they have compounded their
own devices with Chriſts Inſtitution and worſhip. If it
be ſo, he might have done well to have ſhewn us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                  <hi>That however it hath been talked over
aud over, and printea a thouſand times, that there have been
no valià Titles to Government, but what were received
from the People; yet from the very firſt time, that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
called Political was inſtituted in the World, it is a moſt
undeniable truth, that in all the conſiderable Nations which
have ſince been under the Sun, Titles to government, and forms
of Government, have in all times been</hi> de facto <hi>diſpenſed, and
devolved from hand to hand, mediately by the power of the
Sword.</hi> There are but few, or no exceptions that ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
record to the contrary; and indeed, the onely remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inſtances which are contrary, are thoſe in ſacred Story
concerning the State of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
alone it was, above all the Nations upon the face of the
earth, to have perſons and Families<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inveſted with Title
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52973:57"/>
to Government many times, by immediate deſignation from
God himſelf. But this was extraordinary; and excepting
only thoſe extraordinary Inſtances, I am able otherwiſe at
large to make good the Aſſertion. But becauſe I live in a
touchy time, when moſt mens brains are crowing upon
points of Government, I would by no means be miſtaken;
and do therefore for the Readers more right apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my purpoſe, take leave here to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Title to Government,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
I gladly acknowledge that in all times, after Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have been founded and eſtabliſhed by the ſword, then
they who held the Sword have been contented, and thought
it their beſt ſecurity (as indeed it is) to adminiſter Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Law, and accordingly they have been willing to
admit the People to the exerciſe of their Right (more or
leſs) in the making of thoſe Laws whereby they were to
be governed; and ſo the ſuperſtructure in the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi>
of Government by Rulers, hath oftentimes been
carried on by their contenting themſelves to rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſuch Rules or Laws as have been (in a meaſure)
handed out unto them by the Repreſentative Bodies or
Aſſemblies of the People. This hath frequently been the
way, after that Governments and Titles have been ſet up
and founded: But in the <hi>ſetting up</hi> or <hi>founding</hi> of them,
the People have ever had but little, or no ſhare; Titles and
Forms in their original having <hi>de facto</hi> been cut out and
carved by the Sword all over the world, in the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
(and I might ſay, all) Nations. Which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
I ſuppoſe this Political point of his lies flat upon
the ground, and his Aſſertion may with better reaſon be
turned this way; That God hath been ſo far from making
Rulers mediately by the People, that having ever aſſumed
to himſelf the diſpoſing of Governments and Kingdoms to
whom he pleaſeth, as his great prerogative, he hath, in the
ſeveral turns and variations of his Providence concerning
it, generally ſo ordered the matter, that the People have
(for the moſt part) had leaſt to do in founding Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or in making their own Rulers; but that the only
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52973:58"/>
wiſe God having permitted the Sword many times to be
drawn for the executing of his juſtice upon Nations for
their ſins and for the bringing about his own great deſigns
in the world, hath mediately by the Sword exerciſed that
his own Prerogative in ſetting up Governors and Rulers
(at his own pleaſure) and in founding new Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
from time to time: And the ſame God, who
hath conſtantly over-ruled the management of Affairs in
the hands of men after this manner, for bringing things to
a new ſettlement after warlike commotions, hath alſo ſo
diſpoſed the hearts of men to acquieſce therein, that the
Suffrages and Conſent of the People have uſually <hi>ex peſt
facto</hi> been brought and taken in for Confirmation. This
hath been the general courſe of Gods providence in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Governments of this World, as is evident both in
Profane and Sacred Story. In the mention whereof take
notice by the way, that I diſpute not the Peoples right, but
only tell how things have gone <hi>de facto.</hi> What then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> his Poſition, <hi>viz. That God makes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Rulers mediately by the People?</hi> Though it was to
little purpoſe for him to ſtart this point upon this occaſion;
yet it was neceſſary thus much ſhould be returned, to hint
to him his error, notwithſtanding it be a Subject fitter for
a ſet Diſcourſe, than that it ſhould be touched only by the
way.</p>
               <p>2. As the beginning of this Argument is grounded upon
a Miſtake in Politicks; ſo the remainder of it runs upon a
<hi>falſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uppoſition</hi> of Scandal, which is this; That his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the Council have by the Ordinance for Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
eſtabliſhed a Law, authoriſing the Judgments of a
certain number of men (meaning the Commiſſioners)
among us, to be as <hi>the Standard</hi> unto which all other men
muſt conform their Judgments in matters of Faith or
Worſhip, or elſe incur ſome Civil puniſhment, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them from places of Publick Truſt, and from all
Livelihood. For anſwer whereunto, I conceive it is beſide
the buſineſs to debate the Conſtitution of the preſent
Powers, or what they may do, or what the People may do;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52973:58"/>
but I think it becomes us rather to conſider, That his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the Council have not inthroned the Judgments of
the Commiſſioners (as is pretended) ſo as to enable them
to impoſe them upon men in Points relating unto Chriſtian
Faith or Worſhip. As to matters of Worſhip, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
for Approbation meddle not with them at all,
ſave that Common-Prayer men, and men Popiſhly or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly
affected they reject, to ſave the Commiſſioners of
Ejection a labor; and I hope Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is not of opinion that
ſuch as they, though they be generally men of his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
ſhould be allowed a Support by the Magiſtrate,
No perſons are debarred or excluded in reſpect of their
ſeveral ways and Forms of Worſhip, but the door of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
ſtands open to them all alike. Moreover his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the Council have been ſo far from ſetting up the
Judgments of the ſaid Commiſſioners, that They have in the
Ordinances preſcribed them certain Rules, whereby to limit
and regulate their Proceedings; ſo that whatever their
own Judgments in particular may be, yet it is not in their
power to refuſe any man of any Way, Opinion, or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
provided his Qualifications for Grace, unblameable
Converſation, Knowledge and Utterance, have fitted him
to preach the Goſpel; and provided, his Opinion be not
tending to deſtroy the Fundamentals of the Goſpel. Theſe
are the Rules that they are tyed up to, and they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to do, but only to examine and judge how near
the qualifications of men of all Judgments do come up to
thoſe Rules, before they admit them to partake of that
Publick Support and Maintenance which is allowed by the
State.</p>
               <p>The true and full ſtate of the Buſineſs is this in ſhort:—
The Magiſtrate hath in his hand a certain Publick Revenue
ſetled by Law to promote that good work of Preaching
the Goſpel to the People. In the diſpoſing thereof he is
willing to diſcharge a good Conſcience. This he conceives
he cannot better do, than by ſending men abroad to be
ſetled in the ſeveral Places of his Dominions; And before
they be ſent, he thinks he ought to be ſatisfied, that the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52973:59"/>
men, in reſpect of Grace and Gifts, are fitted for the Work;
otherwiſe how can he in Conſcience conceive the Work
will go on as it ought? Now, in regard the Magiſtrate,
being taken up with many great Affairs of State, cannot
himſelf poſſibly take cogniſance of great numbers of men,
by proving and trying their qualifications; He hereupon
makes choice of certain perſons whom he conceives every
way fit, and whom he believeth he may ſafely confide in,
to undertake on his behalf the buſineſs of examining and
trying the qualifications of the men. He conceives alſo it
is his duty to preſcribe Rules and give Inſtructions, whereby
the perſons entruſted ſhould regulate their Judgment and
Proceedings, that ſo he (<hi>viz.</hi> the Magiſtrate) may reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
he hath, on his part, taken order what lieth in him to
make as ſure as may be of entertaining fit and able men to
inſtruct the people under his government. Then, having
reſolved upon the ſaid Rules, he next thinks of a way how
to convey the Truſt of Examination and Trial into the
hands of the aforeſaid perſons. This he doth by a ſpecial
Ordinance or Commiſſion, wherein, beſide the conveyance
of Truſt, the ſaid Rules alſo directing and limiting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Commiſſioners are ſet down, as alſo the
qualifications which he expects all men ſhould have, that
ſeek to enjoy any part of maintenance from him out of
the aforeſaid Publick Revenue. And in caſe the due qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
ſhall be found in any perſons who come to the
Commiſſioners upon the Account of that Publick Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
They have alſo a power by their Commiſſion not
only to approve of the men as fit to receive and enjoy it,
but alſo to grant unto them Admiſſion by a Publick Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in writing under a Common Seal appointed by the
Magiſtrate, whereby they are inveſted with a Legal Title
to poſſeſs and enjoy that portion of the Publick Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which is by Law annexed to the reſpective Places
unto which they are preſented for the preaching of the
Goſpel; and if upon examination they appear not rightly
qualified, they are to have no part of the ſaid Maintenance.—Here
now you have (<hi>ſine ſuco</hi>) the whole and the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52973:59"/>
naked Truth of the matter. The Magiſtrate hath a Publick
Revenue in his hand to promote the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and he takes care to diſpoſe of it in ſuch a manner as
he conceives he may beſt ſatisfie his Conſcience in the doing
of it. Now it ſeems it is not thought fit, that men groſsly
corrupted, and boldly aſſerting the whole Syſteme of Mr.
<hi>G.</hi> his rotten Opinions, ſhould have any portion of it;
and this is the only ground of all theſe cauſeleſs Calumnies
and Imputations by him caſt both upon the Magiſtrate, and
the Commiſſioners, who are but Deputies under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
in the buſineſs. Hence it is that he cries out upon
Lording it over mens Judgments, oppreſſing the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
conſtraining it in matters of Faith, ſelling men to
poverty and diſgrace, becauſe they cannot believe as the
Commiſſioners believe, and I know not how many light
Flouriſhes and Flaſhes more, which may ſerve to dreſs out
an envious Declamation, but fall ſhort of the frame and
conſtitution of a ſerious Argument; this way of Arguing
being in all reſpects a reproach as well to men of Reaſon as
Religion. In a word, the ſum of all is reducible to this:
The Magiſtrate takes a care to diſcharge his Judgment and
Conſcience in diſpoſing a Livelihood which belongs to him
to diſpoſe of; <hi>Ergo</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>) he Lords it over
other mens Judgments and Conſciences, and deprives
them of their Livelihood. Here (Sir) lies the ſtabbing force
of your Argument; Pray ſend this Logick along with
the next grand Volume that you dedicate to the Univerſity
of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and let my Apologie go along with it, for
ſpending ſo much Ink here in repetition of Things, which
have been explained already over and over, in my Anſwers
to ſeveral of the foregoing Arguments: For, I am willing to
do as they do who tend children, not rail, but reel up and
down (Sir) as you do, and run in and out in Tautologie;
not that I love or like it, but becauſe ſo I muſt do, if I mean
to keep you company.</p>
               <p>But before I part with this Argument, I muſt needs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
one thing more not yet cited, which is this; That he
makes the refuſing of men who deſerve not Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be equivalent to a <hi>Civil Mulct,</hi> becauſe thereby
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52973:60"/>
they become excluded from places of publick Truſt in the
matter of Preaching; and thereupon makes an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> it up to the proportion of ſome great cruelty or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Now I would fain know how this can be called a <hi>Civil
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> when men who deſerve not to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>: Give me leave to put a caſe; ſuppoſe
that his Highneſs appoints Commiſſioners for Inſpection,
and gives them authority to make a judgment of the fitneſs
of perſons perhaps in matter of vigilance, <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> skill
in Merchandiſe, Accounts, and other neceſſary Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
to be entruſted with a managing the Exciſe and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of the Nation; Suppoſe likewiſe, that upon trial and
examination of the Perſons, the Commiſſioners do find cauſe
to judge them not fit for ſuch truſt or imployment; ſhall
the refuſing of ſuch perſons, and the denying of them that
Salary which is annexed to the imployment, be ſaid to be
an oppreſſion to them, or a civil Mulct and puniſhment
upon them? For my part, I cannot ſo apprehend it, nor do
I beleeve any man elſe can, without the help of Mr <hi>G.</hi> his
more then ordinary underſtanding. Yet this is the very
caſe of the <hi>Commiſſioners for Approbation;</hi> they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by his Highneſs to judge whether men be fit to
undertake the publick work of preaching; and when upon
Trial they find them otherwiſe, they are to deny them that
publick Salary or Maintenance which is annexed to that
publick work or employment, and not to entruſt them
therein. And now for doing their duty herein, they are
ſaid by him to be Inflicters of a Civil Mulct or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
lords over mens Conſciences, deprivers of livelihood,
and I know not what more: Which how he can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
infer (as the caſe really ſtands) is beyond the reach of
my low apprehenſion.</p>

It (Viz. <hi>the Government</hi>) hath endeavoured to put a ſtop to
that heady way of every man making himſelf a Miniſter,
and a Preacher. It hath endeavoured to ſettle a way for the
approbation of men of Piety and Ability, for the diſcharge of

Work to the Truſt of Perſons both of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and
<hi>Independent</hi> judgment, men of as known Ability, Piety, and
Integrity, as I beleeve any this Nation hath. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
alſo, that in the care they have taken, they have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to approve themſelves to Chriſt, the Nation, and their own
Conſciences. And indeed I think if there be any thing of
Quarrel againſt them, it is (though I ſtand not here to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the proceedings of any) I ſay it is, that they go upon ſuch a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52973:61"/>
Character as the Scripture warranteth, to put men into that
great imployment; and to approve men for it, who are men
that have received gifts from him that aſcended up on high,
and gave gifts for the work of the Miniſtry, and for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It hath alſo taken care (we hope) for the expulſion of all

ſcandalous, and who are the common ſcorn and contempt of

eye upon the Sons of his Opinion, as occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
by the fall of good Benefices: But withall, Patrons
ought to be ſo good-natured as to forget, (as he himſelf
doth) how in other places of this Pamphlet he is pleaſed
to contradict himſelf and their priviledge of Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both together. But that is no wonder in the eye of
thoſe who are acquainted with the Works of Mr</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win.</p>
               <p>Then whereas he inſinuateth, That the ſettlement of the
Commiſſioners is <hi>a new way that puts by another which is
generally known;</hi> the Reader is to conſider, that the old
way generally known was the way of the Biſhops, who
when a Patron made preſentation of any to a Benefice, had
the power of Approbation, and did exerciſe it by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or their Chaplains, before they granted Inſtitution
and Induction. This was the old way generally known,
and it was not put aſide by the preſent way; but fell of it
ſelf many years ago, together with <hi>Epiſcopacie.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
being gone, and there remaining a neceſſity ſtill for
approving men before they enter upon ſuch places of truſt,
then (as you may ſee in the fore-going part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
the Parliament ſetled the power of <hi>Approbation</hi> in
the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> or a Committee of them. And
the Aſſembly ceaſing, it was exerciſed by ſome of their
number till the end of the <hi>Long Parliament.</hi> Afterwards
when his Highneſs came to the Government, He and His
Council finding the great want and neceſſity of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
way for approving of men, and how much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
him to provide betimes, that the publick Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which the Law alloweth for promoting the work
of the Goſpel, ſhould be conferred upon ſuch men as are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52973:62"/>
rightly qualified for the work, that ſo pious and ſound
Preachers might (upon the publick Account) be planted
in the ſeveral parts of the Nation: Hereupon it was, that
they reſolved on the preſent Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Commiſſioners
for Approbation;</hi> which was ſo far from juſtling out any
old way generally known and uſed (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> pretends)
that it came in when there was no good and regular way
left for the carrying on of ſo good a work. What ground
then of diſcontent can any man have, or pretend, upon the
pretended putting by of another way? But Mr. <hi>Goodwin's</hi>
Pen is a Quill taken out of his own high-flying Phant'ſie:
If he do but fancy a thing (right or wrong) he dares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
print it to all the world: But would any man
do ſo, that were not inwardly tempted and ſet on work to
create diſcontents and diſturbances in the mindes of the
weaker perſons, and to deceive and draw them in, upon
miſtakes and falſhoods, to be offended, and become Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in crying down an Eſtabliſhment? ſuch an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for promoting the preaching of the Goſpel, as upon a
right enquiry into the matter, cannot in the leaſt meaſure
be offenſive to any who are truly godly; againſt which
though <hi>Cerberus</hi> may bark, becauſe he and his Litter are
not like to have an<note n="*" place="margin">Offa Cerbero.</note>

               <p>No, nor yet all the lewd and ſcandalous Inſinuations
which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath here packt together. For, though accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his wonted liberty he preſume to ſcratch the faces of
the Commiſſioners with a licentious pen, charging them to
have preferred perſons as unworthy as ever were preſented
by any Patrons, yet he hath not been able to produce one
Inſtance to make the leaſt proof of ſo high and general a
Charge in any one particular: But that we muſt ſuppoſe
to be the modeſty of the man, and his great ingenuity to
forbear particulars: So he ſeems to intimate unto us in the
following words, whereby he doth as good as confeſs he
hath no matters of Fact to make good the Charge. <hi>For</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>I always judged it beneath a ſpirit of ingenuity to

hold intelligence with any man for information of the ſiniſter

Brethren home and heavily in general terms, but is ſo full
of ingenuity as to tell us why he ſpares the mention of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
even becauſe he hath none that he knows of, either
upon record or in memory. If this be not a man of rare
Reaſon and Religion in matter of Argument, let the World
judge; or what credit may be given to him now or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,

                  </note> He in the next place
is ſo kind as to ſtart an Argument on the behalf of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.
<hi>If it be argued</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>on their behalf, that it
is neither meet in point of Conſcience or Religion, nor yet pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
or ſafe in point of Policie, that all Patrons, authoriſed
for ſuch by Law, ſhould be ſuffered to prefer to the work of the
Miniſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all places where they have to do, whom; or what
manner of perſons they pleaſe; For, by this means, a great
part of the Parochial Congregations in the Land ſhould (in all
likelihood) have either Popiſh, or ignorant, or ungodly, or
Malignant perſons ſet over them in the work of the Lord; the
ſad Conſequence whereof is every mans apprehenſion.</hi> This is
an Argument indeed; and there is not ſo much as the
ſhadow of an Argument in all his Book beſide: For, moſt
certain it is, that if there be not a ſetled Courſe for the
proving and approving of perſons preſented to Benefices,
then Patrons may at random put in what manner of men
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52973:63"/>
they pleaſe, either inſufficient, profane, or malignant; and
what the iſſue of that would be, is obvious to any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man. But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> brings not this here as an Argument
to any good intent; for he hales it in as an Objection againſt
himſelf, merely to make way for the purgation of ſome
other odd humors, which he calls Anſwers to this Objection
(ſeven in number) and hath put them to do ſervice in the
Reer, in hope they may do ſomwhat to win the day: But
upon examination, they are like to prove as Forlorne as any
of the Eighteen Arguments newly defeated, and ſerve only
to render them the more contemptible, by reaſon of a
certain Figure called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, much uſed by Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
in his way of Rhetoriſing.</p>
               <p>1. In his Firſt Anſwer to the foregoing Objection,<note place="margin">A Survey of the Anſwers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brought by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> againſt the Objection raiſed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> he
implicitely acknowledgeth, that it would be a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> to
the Nation, that perſons preſented to Livings ſhould paſs
and poſſeſs them, without ſome previous courſe for Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
and in this Anſwer he implieth likewiſe, that the
way of Approbation is a <hi>Remedy;</hi> only this preſent way of
Approbation, now eſtabliſhed in the hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
is (as he ſaith) <hi>a Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe.</hi>
As he here implieth, ſo by and by he openly expreſſeth
himſelf in the following Anſwers, that a Power of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
may be requiſite to reſt ſomewhere, but he would
have it be in other hands; the only ſpight is at the men
who are now inveſted with that power, and for their ſakes
'tis that he is ſo angry, both at the Magiſtrate, and at the
Courſe which is by him eſtabliſhed. All would do well, if
theſe were but out of Commiſſion; partly becauſe Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
himſelf is none of their number, and more eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot approve men high in his monſtrous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>2. This appears further by what he ſaith in that which
he calls the Second Anſwer,<note place="margin">A reply to Mr <hi>G.</hi> his ſecond Anſwer.</note> where, like a wiſe State-mender,
he takes upon him magiſterially to cenſure the Actions of
his Superiors, telling them, <hi>It is no ways neceſſary either the
ſame Commiſſioners ſhould be entruſted with the Inſpection of
the buſineſs throughout the whole Nation, or that thoſe who now
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52973:64"/>
occupy the places of Commiſſioners ſhould put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the vile and the precious in their Decrees of Reprobation.</hi>
As to this latter Arrow ſhot at the Perſons who are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
I ſhall make no other Return but this, That it
is a vile Scandal againſt men whom himſelf hath commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Epiſtle, and who are eſteemed precious in the ſight
of them that fear God in the Land; and it muſt be ranked
among the reſt of his unchriſtian Calumniations; for ſo
now I may ſafely call them, ſeeing in the Cloſe of his
Eighteenth Argument (as hath been already ſhewn) he as
good as confeſſeth he is not able to make proof of any
one particular: And therefore though in the enſuing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
he takes occaſion all along to be ſpatter the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,</hi>
no notice need be taken of it, becauſe being
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſelf-condemned man, it will be no injury
either to him, or the Reader, to diſmiſs him with this brief
Retort of the Proverb, That <hi>his Tongue</hi> (his Pen) <hi>is no
ſlander.</hi> As touching his Cenſure of the preſent Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he adds, <hi>That it would have been much better to
have framed the Commiſſion of</hi> Triers, <hi>according to the
Model and Tenor of the Commiſſion of</hi> Ejectors, <hi>and to have
appointed men for that ſervice in each County reſpectively,
by which means the grandure of their power and authority
would not have been ſo Hyper-Archiepiſcopal, ſo Super-Metropolitan
and Roming as now it is.</hi> Here the Reader
hath words for his money, and his Highneſs and the
Council have Advice for nothing, from this Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantaſtical
Metropolitan of <hi>Bell-Alley,</hi> and all the other
By-lanes within the Juriſdiction of <hi>Coleman.</hi> But before I
ken him thanks for his Counſel, I muſt needs give him the
<hi>Ferula</hi> once more for Contradiction, and this within the
narrow compaſs of three lines; one while acknowledging
the work of the Commiſſioners to be a <hi>SERVICE,</hi>
and then immediately talking idly of <hi>the grandeur of their
power and Authority,</hi> which in other places of his Book
he in other Terms calleth a <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and <hi>Dominion.</hi> But
this being ordinary with him, we muſt take the leſs notice
of it, and make him ſome return for his Counſel, it being
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52973:64"/>
his opinion, that men ſhould <hi>be appointed for that ſervice
of Trial and Approbation in each County.</hi> I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to dive into thoſe Reaſons which induced his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the Council to ſettle that Commiſſion as now it
is; yet I think I have ſomewhat to offer that may ſatisfie
any reaſonable man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is obſervable, that his Highneſs having near
one half of the Livings in <hi>England</hi> (one way or other)
in his own immediate diſpoſal by Preſentation, He ſeldom
beſtoweth one of them upon any man whom himſelf doth
not firſt examine and make Trial of in perſon; ſave only
that at ſuch times as his great Affairs happen to be more
urgent then ordinary, he uſeth to appoint ſome other to
do it on his behalf: Which is ſo rare an example of Piety,
that the like is not to be found in the Stories of Princes.
This Religious Act of his I take leave to mention, becauſe
it ſtands as an Argument againſt the County-Project, one
Reaſon whereof by him alledged is, That men may be
ſaved the labor of coming to <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Approbation:</hi>
For, place the Commiſſion where you will, one half of
the Miniſters muſt come to <hi>London,</hi> that they may have
a Preſentation: Beſides, the <hi>First-Fruits-Office,</hi> where all
are to compound, is only in this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to conſider, whether his Highneſs
can, in the remote parts of the Nation, find out ſuch men
as he may judge to be equally qualified for the Work.
God be bleſſed, this Nation abounds with learned and
pious Preachers of the Goſpel, and ſo much the more, by
reaſon of the conſcientious care and induſtry of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Commiſſioners; but it's to be feared, not a Number
of ſuch will be found, who for Parts and Graces may
be ſufficient to manage a Truſt of ſo high an Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Admit a ſufficient number of ſuch perſons can
be found in each County, yet his Highneſs muſt put them
into Commiſſion, upon recommendation made (for the
moſt part) by others: And ſurely, his Highneſs cannot
repoſe that confidence in perſons recommended by others,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52973:65"/>
as in them, whoſe Sufficiencies and Qualifications he is
acquainted with upon his own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, conſider whether it be fit, that the Nation
ſhould be filled with ſo many new Commiſſions, as to have
one erected in each County when there is no neceſſity for
it, and when there cannot be much work in a County for
Commiſſioners to do, ſeeing (take one County with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
there will be hardly above ten perſons in a year to be
approved in each County, as might be demonſtrated by the
Books of the <hi>Firſt-fruits Office;</hi> and whether meeting ſo
ſeldom, and being to come together to a certain place at an
uncertain time (as men die out of their livings) and this
from the remoteſt parts perhaps of the County, it would
be conſidered alſo, who ſhall ſummon them together; and if
they do meet, who ſhall bear their charges, and defraythe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incident expences, unleſs you would have a new charge
impoſed on each County, and the Formality of an Office
and neceſſary Officers erected, to bring a new unneceſſary
trouble and burthen upon the Counties; and all to pleaſure
Mr <hi>G.</hi> who ſeeing no likelihood of bringing the higher
Powers to his Bow, applieth himſelf by his Inſinuations,
to the People in Counties; and, as if he were to act that
part in the Poet (<hi>Flectere ſi nequeo ſuperos, Acheronta mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vebo</hi>)
would move Hell, were it in his power, to overthrow
theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe <hi>Helliſh Termenters,</hi> for ſo the word
imports, and is in his charity a ſufficient reward for their
faithful endeavours; for were it not for a Zeal in them to
be faithful, they have an opportunity to pleaſe All, and that
without any Concernment or loſſe to themſelves, unleſs it
be of a good Conſcience; which is not much to Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
&amp;c. By the <hi>Arminian Black Art,</hi> they can at their
pleaſure find that again.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It would be conſidered, whether the diſtributing
of Commiſſions for Approbation in the Counties, would
not be a means to occaſion that which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſo much
chargeth upon the preſent Commiſſioners, <hi>Viz. Partiality,</hi>
rather than amend the matter, if any ſuch thing were:
For, it is much more probably to be expected in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52973:65"/>
where the Approvers and thoſe who are to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
will be known to one another, and may be either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to, or acquainted with one another, or perhaps be
recommended by Friends, and ſo upon one of theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
men may gain an Approbation though they deſerve
it not; and on the other ſide, perhaps others who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
may, becauſe of ſome particular animoſities, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
upon that account to be diſ-approved. By this means
there will be a greater door opened to Partialities and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
(if men made Commiſſioners in Counties ſhould
be prone thereto) than can poſſibly be feared from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
here above; who not being expoſed to the ſame
Temptations through Acquaintance, Relation, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
in reſpect of the generality of the perſons (being
ſtrangers) that come to them, as it is not likely they ſhould
(if they were corrupt) prove partial towards many, ſo it
is moſt probable, that wanting the ſame Inducements which
others will be lyable to in the Counties, they will not
probably run into the like enormities and corruptions.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is worthy conſideration, whether that which
Mr <hi>G.</hi> hath faſtned as a heavy charge (though falſly as I
have before proved) upon the preſent Commiſſioners,
<hi>Viz.</hi> as if their power were ſuch that no Appeal could
be from it, and ſo no remedy in caſe they abuſe the Power
(whether this, I ſay, which he unrighteouſly chargeh upon
them) would not in effect be ſo indeed in the hands of
County-Commiſſioners: For here at <hi>London,</hi> if men think
they have injury done at their Trial or Examination,
the remedy of <hi>Appeal</hi> (as Mr <hi>G.</hi> well knoweth) is ready at
hand; but ſhould the power of Approbation be ſetled in
County-Commiſſioners, it would be a great way about for
any perſon ſo injured, before he can get remedy, becauſe it
would be one tedious work to come up (ſuppoſe, as Mr <hi>G.</hi>
doth, from the remoteſt part of the Land) to complain
and make the Appeal; then that being done, the more
tedious work would be to fetch the Commiſſioners up to
<hi>London</hi> to anſwer the charge exhibited here againſt them;
or elſe his Highneſs and the Council muſt be put to a new
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52973:66"/>
trouble to ſend another Commiſſion into the Country to
other perſons, to judge the proceedings of thoſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
which by the time that the whole round of the
buſineſs ſhall be run out from one to another, will induce
a ſufficient expence (beſide trouble) to the party complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who by this means, in ſtead of once coming up hither
for Approbation, may happen to have his journey and
expences doubled and trebled upon him. And what (I
pray you) would the Conſequence be? Would not men
(for the moſt part) be content rather to ſit down by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
then put themſelves upon ſuch a tedious and expenſive
Courſe for remedy?</p>
               <p>And therefore, 7. laſtly, it ought to be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this difficulty of the remedy by Appeal in caſe of
wrong done by the County-Commiſſioners, would not
prove an occaſion of making ſuch as might be that way
enclined, preſume to become the more corrupt and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
when they ſhould ſee that it would be ſo tedious a
matter for men to get remedie againſt them. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the Reader put all theſe Conſiderations together in
the Balance with one ſingle journey to <hi>London,</hi> which is
ſo cried out on by Mr <hi>G.</hi> and then judge whether it be
not more tolerable than theſe, and many other Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
(not here named) which may happen, and which
men muſt hazard, in caſe the Buſineſs here impleaded
were intruſted to Commiſſioners in the Counties.</p>
               <p>But this is not all I have to ſay in Reply to Mr <hi>G.</hi> upon
this particular of mens making journies to <hi>London.</hi> For
though he report the matter ſo, as if they were neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to make journies ordinarily from the remoteſt parts of
the Land; yet this is moſt certain (and the known daily
practiſe of the Commiſſioners doth confirm it) that if any
man who is preſented to a living be weak or poor, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
not able to take a journey without much prejudice,
then the Commiſſioners here are wont to make a ſpecial
Reference to three or four able and godly Miniſters, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in the County, and according to the return made the
Commiſſioners uſe to determine the buſineſs; they having
here always by them a Catalogue of the Names of ſuch
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52973:66"/>
choice godly Miniſters in each County, whom upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
they can ſafely confide in for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Godwin</hi> is (it ſeems) a moſt provoked Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Commiſſioners; and though in the foregoing
part of his Book he hath been very hot againſt the Exerciſe
of a Power of Approbation, yet now he is willing to forget
himſelf again, and to admit the exerciſe of it, provided it be
any where but in the hands of theſe Commiſſioners; and
therefore he turns every ſtone to exaſperate all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
againſt them. One while, he takes upon him to make
a Tender of this Power to the <hi>gathered Churches;</hi> and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſt they ſhould not look after it, he in the next place
would caſt it upon thoſe of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way, as part of
amends for all the Injuries he hath done them formerly; and
if they ſhould refuſe it, he hath a third Reſerve, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to beſtow it upon the reſpective Pariſhes. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
any thing ſhould be done with the great Truſt of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
let it be diſpoſed any how, or any where, ſo that
he may have his will upon theſe Commiſſioners, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the preſent Eſtabliſhment made by Authority. Theſe
particular Humors of his I come now to manifeſt in Order.</p>
               <p>Being come to his third Anſwer to the Objection that
was ſtarted by himſelf on the behalf of the buſineſs of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Reply to Mr <hi>G.</hi> his third Anſwer.</note> I find the Anſwer fall ſhort of ſatisfaction; for
rather then the preſent Commiſſioners ſhould be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he pleads here now on the behalf of the <hi>Churches;</hi> and
would have the power veſted in them, ſaying, <hi>That the
work is more proper for them,</hi> Viz. <hi>The Congregated Churches
throughout the Nation, then for a handful of petty Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(as they are called) unto whom alone it is now upon the
matter devolved, ſitting in one Angle only of the Nation.</hi>
It is not to be wondred at, that he who dares preſume to
vilifie and diſpute the Authority, and the wiſdom of his
Prince, ſhould ſo meanly repreſent <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the place of
his Reſidence, as to term it an Angle of the Nation. Had
not this been <hi>given at our Palace at Colemanſtreet,</hi> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Princes Court could not have been ſo mean in the
thoughts of this Imperial Penman, as to be reputed but a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52973:67"/>
Corner: But thus it muſt be, in an Age when we will all be
Princes; and can he be leſs who looks upon his Brethren
the Commiſſioners as but <hi>a handfull of petty Clergy-men?</hi>
But (high and mighty Sir!) be pleaſed to tell us who
among them doth aſſume the Title of <hi>Clergy,</hi> or who
ever called them ſo beſide your ſelf? Nor are they all
<hi>Clergy-men</hi> (ſo called) but there are likewiſe men of the
<hi>Laity</hi> (if for diſtinction ſake I may ſay ſo) among them; there
are perſons, men of honor, and of greateſt Truſt in Civil
affairs; and therefore for ſhame away with theſe poor
ſlie Tricks of odious Inſinuation, which are foiſted in out
of a corrupt deſign to prejudicate the Reader, and are the
infallible Evidences of a corrupt heart; and ſo they muſt
be judged by all the <hi>Congregated Churches</hi> who have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to take notice of this your behaviour.</p>
               <p>But now let us ſee what he ſaith here of the <hi>Congregated</hi>
or <hi>Gathered Churches.</hi> And before I proceed, know, that
the intent is not to diminiſh or detract any thing from the
reputation of the Churches, but only to ſhew, by way of
Anſwer, how inconvenient a Thing that would be which
he endeavors to faſten upon them.</p>
               <p>1. For proof that it is a work more proper for the
Churches to ſend men abroad to preach the Goſpel, he
brings in two Texts out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 11. 22. and 13. 3, 4.
Which Texts do prove no more but that <hi>Barnabas</hi> in one
place ſingly, in another place jointly with <hi>Paul,</hi> was ſent
out by the Church to preach the Goſpel. That this <hi>de facto</hi>
was done, it proveth, and doubtleſs it was well done of
the Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> ſo to do: But
will Mr. <hi>G.</hi> from the occaſional Acts of thoſe Churches,
which they did as Chriſtians, thereupon infer, that no other
Chriſtians whatſoever; whether ſingle perſons or collective
bodies, ought to do ſo good an act as to ſend men abroad
to preach the Goſpel? Will he, becauſe it was a good Deed
done by them, conclude, that no other men whatſoever
ſhould look upon it as their duty to promote ſo good a
work? Certainly, in thoſe acts which are of Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in the general, (that is, which all men who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52973:67"/>
Chriſtianity are as Chriſtians bound to doe) what
example ſoever we find of them either among the Apoſtles,
the primitive Diſciples, or the Churches, that example is
ſo far from being to be made a ground to argue we ought
not to do the like, that it rather obligeth all Chriſtians in
ſucceſſion of time for ever to imitate the ſame upon all
good opportunities and occaſions. And therefore if the
preaching of the Goſpel, and the advancement of it in the
world, be a work which it concerns every man profeſſing
Chriſtianity, <hi>quatenus</hi> a Chriſtian, to promote, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Magiſtrate, being a Chriſtian, is even from the
example of thoſe Churches, here alleadged by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
bound to ſend, and uſe all means convenient to ſend men
abroad, by Preaching to publiſh and promote the Goſpel.
Give me leave to illuſtrate this by an Inſtance. We read
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. of a liberal Collection made by the Churches of
<hi>Macedonia</hi> for relief of the poor Saints in <hi>Judaea:</hi> Now,
according to Mr. <hi>Goodwin's</hi> deep way of arguing, it ought
to be concluded thence, that becauſe the Churches did it,
therefore no particular perſon or perſons whatſoever (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Magiſtrates or others) profeſſing Chriſtianity, ought
to make a collection or liberal contribution for the relief of
poor Chriſtian Profeſſors. The wild Inference would be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as good a ground from this, as that made by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> from
the other; becauſe the work of endeavouring to augment
the number of Chriſtian Profeſſors, and that of relieving
poor Profeſſors, are works or duties both alike incumbent
upon all Chriſtians in general, <hi>quatenus</hi> Chriſtians: So
that if from the one example he will infer, that none but
Gathered Churches ought to approve and ſend men abroad
to preach, I from the other example can as readily and
naturally infer, that none but Gathered Churches ought to
exerciſe liberality towards the poor Saints; yea, that no
particular man ought to do it, becauſe it was an act of thoſe
primitive Churches. And therefore I conceive 'tis more fit
and juſtifiable to conclude, that when we meet with a noble
and illuſtrious example among the Apoſtles and primitive
Churches, if it be of ſuch a thing as concerns Chriſtian
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52973:68"/>
practice, <hi>i. e.</hi> every Chriſtian, ſo far as in him lieth, in
matter of duty, the nobleneſs of the example of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
perſons ſhould ſerve to raiſe and quicken our
affections to imitate them, in matters of ordinary duty, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than permit our ſelves to be deluded by Satan, when he
ſuggeſts that we ought not to follow them, becauſe they have
led us the way.—Thus you ſee what a proper Divinity-Argument
he brings to prove, that ſending men abroad to
preach, is the proper work of the Churches: But till he
be able to prove, that it belongs to a Church <hi>omni, ſoli, &amp;
ſemper,</hi> his Argument will fall.</p>
               <p>2. The next particulars he produceth are points of
Prudence, to prove the ſaid Churches ought to have the
power of approving and ſending Preachers abroad. One
point is this; <hi>Becauſe the Churches are more like to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
what they ſhould do in this kind, than the ſealed Knot
of Triers; theſe all being but a few, and making but one
Conſiſtory, and ſo the whole buſineſs of Trying throughout
the Nation lying on their hands, they are in no capacity
(eſpecially meeting ſo ſeldom Conſistory-wiſe, as they do) to
allow a meet proportion of time for the regular traverſing of
matters committed unto them, at leaſt not without conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many of their Suitors to dance a troubleſom Attendance
upon them for their diſpatch; whereas the Churches being
many, the work and buſineſs of Trying being diſributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them (as it is like it would be, if it were committed to
them) would have leiſure to make a due enquiry into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that ſhould come before them, and this without any tedious
or chargeable delay unto the perſons.</hi> It is not my buſineſs
to determine who would be moſt conſiderate, the ſaid
Churches, or others, in the managing of this buſineſs; but
to conſider, whether the way by him propounded for
placing the power in the Churches, be in reaſon likely to
anſwer the end of his Highneſs and the Council in the
carrying on of the work, with ſuch conveniencie, for the
honor of God, the good of the Commonwealth, and the
intereſt and encouragement of Preachers themſelves. Not
but that I believe the Churches would to their power diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52973:68"/>
a good conſcience in the buſineſs, and are ſufficient
both for grace and knowledge to do it; only I conceive,
that they are Bodies, both in reſpect of the manner of their
conſtitution, and divers other reſpects, not in a capacity
meet to anſwer the Magiſtrates expectation in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
of ſuch an Affair; as I ſhall manifeſt by and by.
In the mean time, whereas he ſaith here, the Commiſſioners
<hi>are but few, but one Conſistory, and that the work lies upon
their hands, they not having time to traverſe matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making Suitors attend long;</hi> the Reader is to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the Commiſſioners are ſuch a number as Authority
hath judged convenient; and if there were need of more,
the ſame hands who placed theſe, are not ſo ſtreightned,
but that upon occaſion they have added, and are ready to
add unto their number. Only they are wiſe otherwiſe than
Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and are willing to tread in the ſteps of antient
prudence, confirmed by the experience of all Ages. But
how this point of prudence ſhould be better anſwered by
placing the power in the Churches, I do not underſtand.
Which of them (I pray) ſhall undertake the buſineſs in a
County? Or, 1. Admit ſome one Congregational or gather'd
Church ſhould have the power, would it not diſpleaſe all
the reſt of a County which are not of that Church, or not
of the ſame Opinions with that Church? 2. Whereas you
ſay now, <hi>Congregational Churches,</hi> then it muſt belong to
them either as <hi>Congregational,</hi> or as <hi>Churches.</hi> If as a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
then the power reſts well where it is; for, the
Commiſſioners are a Congregation made up of Forty
perſons at leaſt, and all of them Elders of Churches, or fit
for it. If as <hi>Churches,</hi> then ſurely, <hi>Presbyterial</hi> or <hi>Parochial,</hi>
ſo far as they have the eſſence of a Church, ought alſo to
be truſted. 3. Beſides, it would be conſidered, whether you
would have the whole Body of a gathered Church, or only
ſome part of it to be entruſted with the ſaid power in a
County. If you ſay, ſome part ſhould have it; then, as it will
be diſpleaſing to the other part neglected, ſo you loſe your
intent (Sir) becauſe you ſay it ought to be in, not parts of
Churches, but Churches; and to this purpoſe your before-cited
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52973:69"/>
Texts out of the <hi>Acts</hi> do ſpeak, which you brought
to prove that Churches ſent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to preach
the Goſpel; for in thoſe Texts it was the Act of whole
Bodies of Churches. On the other ſide then, if you
ſay the whole Body of a Church, or a Church as a
Body, ſhould act therein, then I ſuppoſe that things
being carried in that Body by common Suffrage, the
matter will be ſo far from being mended that way in
point of quick diſpatch, that delayes muſt needs be
more tedious than ever: As for the Commiſſioners they
have their meetings conſtantly two daies in a week, which
they find ſufficient to do the work, and yet put men to no
more attendance than the neceſſity of the inſufficiency and
doubtfulneſs of divers perſons doth require. But ſaith he,
<hi>how oft the Triers have daſhed their feet at theſe and ſuch
like ſtones, is known unto, and lamented by many.</hi> To ſuch
unworthy Provocations whereof your Book is full, I make
no other Return but this, that you have all along proved
your ſelf a meer Calumniator, never daring to make one
Inſtance (which your ſweet ſpirit of revenge could not
have omitted, had you had any thing of Fact, though but
upon ſurmiſe;) and in the Concluſion of all your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(as hath been declared ſufficiently already) you are ſo
ingenuous as to ſhame the Devil, when you confeſſe you
have no particulars of proof, <hi>either upon record, or in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</hi>
Which certainly ought to be a lamentation to your
ſelf, when you conſider, it being a matter of grief and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
to others who have had occaſion to obſerve
your demeanour.</p>
               <p>A Third Reaſon is (he ſaith) <hi>Becauſe the Church Bodies
are not accompliſhed with any ſuch Politick reaches, deep me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
ſubtil Contrivances for the bringing about of ſecular
Projects, or By-ends, as our</hi> Triers <hi>are.</hi> Still this is matter
of ſcandal againſt the Commiſſioners, and little better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Churches: For, as he calls his own a company
of Sheep, ſo he ſeems to make all the reſt but ſheep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
repreſenting them as weak heads in the general, and
implying that they may have <hi>reaches,</hi> and <hi>methods,</hi> and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52973:69"/>
                  <hi>contrivances</hi> to bring about by-Ends, as well as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
onely they have not <hi>ſuch</hi> deep Reaches and
contrivances; which is in effect to ſay, they may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
as well as the Commiſſioners, onely they have not ſo
much wit as the Commiſſioners have to bring ends about.
Now on the other ſide, put caſe that the Commiſſioners
be godly conſcientious men (as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his Epiſtle
ſaith they are) and ſuppoſe it be admitted (as I have no
reaſon to the contrary) that the Churches alſo are, for the
moſt part, godly conſcientious people, yet certainly Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> having declared his opinion, that the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
have the better Brains to manage a buſineſs, then I
hope the Churches have reaſon to conſider him, and ken
him thanks for his kindneſs, and the Magiſtrate muſt needs
reſt better ſatisfied to truſt a ſelect company of known
able and good men, than to commit this buſineſs of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
to the Churches in general, who though they
may have as much good meaning, yet Mr <hi>G.</hi> ſaith, they
have not ſo deep a reach as the preſent Commiſſioners.
Moreover, <hi>the Churches</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>are not, in reſpect of their
numbers, and complicated variety of Intereſts and Conditions
in their reſpective Members, very capable of conſpiring or
combining ſo much as in the propoſal of any undue or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ends to themſelves, and ſo are like to be more ſincere and
plain-hearted in their proceedings.</hi> 'Tis like they will not
be forward to propoſe any thing tending to an unworthy
end; but on the other ſide, it ought to be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Account which Mr <hi>G.</hi> hath here given touching
their conſtitution, be not rather an Argument to prove
that it will be a hard matter for them to come to any end
or Concluſion at all, in convenient time for the diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Buſineſs which himſelf hath ſaid ought not to
take up too much attendance. For, 1. <hi>In reſpect of their
numbers,</hi> the general Maxime is, That great Bodies move
but ſlowly. 2. <hi>In reſpect of their complicated variety of
Intereſts and Conditions in their reſpective Members;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that always according to the variety of mens
Intereſts and Conditions, they come to be variouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52973:70"/>
they will debate a matter round, and they will too
often debate for victory, too often to gratifie a friend, too
often to gratifie a ſpleen, and too long to do any buſineſs,
in manner or time convenient as it ought to be; which is
ſufficiently evident, by the experience of all Ages, where
various intereſts and conditions of men have met in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
popular Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>A fourth Reaſon is, he ſaith, <hi>Becauſe the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of different judgments touching Diſcipline and Worſhip,
and ſome other opinions much controverted and debated among
godly, ſober, and worthy men in the Nation, may amongſt
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this with a full concurrence and conſent of their
judgments, and without the leaſt regret or check of conſcience,
accommodate all pious and godly perſons, of what judgment
ſoever otherwiſe, in all their juſt deſires or requeſts.</hi> I am
very loth to rip up Sores, becauſe it is to be done in publick,
and it may more gratifie the common Enemy, the Papiſt,
than benefit our ſelves; but ſeeing it is a matter too well
known already, I may touch it a little, and ſhall but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Do we not know how far the minds of men have been
from accommodating upon points of Diſcipline and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and all other Opinions, that though (ſome of them)
religious and ſober in all other things, yet they have
been at daggers drawing in this? Have not too many in the
Churches been drawn out by a miſ-guided zeal, even to the
anathematizing of their brethren who walk not in the ſame
Church-way with them, about points of Diſcipline and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?
And is not the ſame humour too predominant ſtill
among too many? I ſhall (for Religion and Honors ſake)
forbear a running out into the large field of Particulars:
But certainly, when it is known, that divers of the Churches
have divided among themſelves, and broken that unity of
the Spirit which ought to be in the Bond of Peace, and
this meerly upon difference of judgment concerning ſome
Points not Fundamental and that ſome have proceeded ſo
far, even againſt their fellow-members in one and the ſame
Church, ſo as to un-faint one another round, and make a
Schiſm in the Body, it would be a ſtrange thing if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52973:70"/>
Magiſtrate underſtanding this, and having undertaken
the protection of the people of God in general, who walk
under ſeveral Forms and Perſwaſions, ſhould venture the
Truſt of Approbation in ſo great a latitude as the hands of
the gathered Churches throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi>
ſeeing the generality of men in Churches are ſo much
diſpoſed to favour men, ſome one way, ſome another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their various Inclinations, that the meaſure of
Approbation (were the power of it in the Churches) is not
like to be taken ſo often from the proportions of Grace and
ſound Knowledge of Fundamentals of Faith in men to be
approved, as from the correſpondence and conſent which
they may have with this, that, or the other Opinion held
by the Majority of thoſe who are to approve them.—
But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> layeth this as a blame upon the Commiſſioners,
ſaying, that they expreſs wrath againſt men, <hi>becauſe diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Judgment from themſelves, and have laced their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
ſo ſtrait, that themſelves profeſs they cannot without
ſin open the dore of entrance into the Miniſtry to any man, but
thoſe whoſe thoughts are their thoughts, and one judgment
with them in matters of Chriſtian faith.</hi> This groundleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
I have wiped off already divers times, upon ſeveral
occaſions given as I paſſed through his Book; where I
have ſhewn, that the Commiſſioners, by the very conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ordinance, have no ſuch power, nor do they
uſe any ſuch practice, nor can they if they would, becauſe
themſelvs are men of the various Ways and Perſwaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
among us, but agree in this, that they hold faſt the
Foundation, Fundamental Truths, and reject none but ſuch
as hold the contrary, in which number Mr. <hi>Goodwin's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded.
<hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets are juſtly reckoned: And as it
is the glory of the Commiſſioners, that they profeſs they
cannot approve ſuch as hold them, ſo it is the ſole ground
of all his clamor againſt them. He would muſter up men,
raiſe Batteries, and plant his great Guns in all the Pulpits of
<hi>England,</hi> againſt the <hi>GRACE OF GOD,</hi> which I
may call the Fort-Royal of Chriſtian verity; but not being
able to get Commiſſions for his men, he is fain to play at
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52973:71"/>
ſmall game, ſhooting Paper-pellets and Squibs of Slander
in Pamphlets againſt the ſaid Commiſſioners, not ſparing
even his Highneſs and the Council, for their great love
to the Lord Jeſus, manifeſted in ſo religious a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>His fifth and laſt reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the Churches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly
diſperſed throughout the Nation, for perſons from all
quarters to repair unto one or other of them, witbout the charge
or trouble of long journies; whereas the Triers</hi> (whom alſo
he is pleaſed to term <hi>Inquiſitors) have their Chamber of
Audience fixed ſome hundreds of miles off from the skirts of
the Nation, ſo that men muſt make tedious and chargeable
journies to them.</hi> Thus you have him playing the Tautologer
again; therefore I muſt ſend you back to the Anſwer given
him in another place about <hi>long journies,</hi> where you will find
that care is ſufficiently taken to prevent long Journies; and
I have ſhewn, that men would be conſtrained to endure
many far worſe inconveniences, and the longeſt Journies
perhaps over and over, and to little purpoſe, in caſe but
one Chamber of Audience were ſetled in a County, much
more when he would have as many as there are gathered
Churches in every County. Moreover, the ſame Reaſons
which I have before alleadged againſt ſetling the power
of Approbation in County-Commiſſioners, do much more
make againſt ſetling it in the ſaid Churches in each County:
For, is it imaginable, that the generality of Gather'd
Churches can yield men of Parts and Piety fitted for the
work of Trying and Approving, in all reſpects equal to
the perſons now imployed by his Highneſs? It would be
fit alſo to conſider, whether whole Churches, or parts of
Churches; or, there being perhaps many gather'd Churches
in a County, whether all of them, or ſome few, or ſome
one of them, or part of all, or few, or ſome one of them,
ſhall be intruſted; and how either of theſe can
be imployed, without diſpleaſing all the reſt? If you
ſay all thoſe Churches are to be intruſted; that would breed
a moſt ridiculous confuſion in Counties where there are
many ſuch Churches; and if ſome parts of Churches, or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52973:71"/>
only a part of ſome one Church, then it would be work
enough for his Highneſs and the Council to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
aright who among them all are moſt fit, and who
unfit for the managing of ſuch a Truſt: And when all is
done, what ſatisfaction would it be to thoſe of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
way, to ſee only the Gather'd Churches, or ſome
part of them only imployed, and themſelves excluded from
a ſhare in ſo great a Truſt, and the men of their way left
(as to the matter of Approving or Diſapproving) wholly
to the diſpoſition of the ſaid Churches? Which certainly
ought not to be, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath in his very next
Paragraph pleaded on their behalf, as men fit to be made
Judges in the matter of Approbation, forgetting (as in
other caſes he hath done the like) that in this Paragraph
he produceth it, as meet only for the ſaid Churches; but
'tis no wonder he ſhould propound contradictory courſes
in matter of Practice, whoſe ſad hap it is to have his crazie
Intellect laboring under the continual diſtempers of ſelf-contradiction
in matter of Reaſon. But waving this, it
would be worthy conſideration next (as touching the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting
of the Churches, whether whole or in part) what
certain place they ſhall meet at, who ſhall ſummon them,
who ſhall bear their charges, and defray other incident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
how their Records ſhall be kept, how their Regiſter
and other neceſſary Officers ſhall be maintained, and by
whom; and how other things can be done with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for the conveying of a Legal title to Preachers, in
thoſe Livings to which they are preſented, in ſo ſecure and
regular a courſe of proceeding, as is obſerved by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Commiſſioners? And what if a Church break to
peeces? And what ſhall be done with the Records of ſuch
an Office?—But by this time, I ſuppoſe the Reader
hath enough of Mr. <hi>Goodwin's</hi> Five Reaſons, wherefore
he would have the power of Approbation ſetled in the
Gather'd Churches of the ſeveral Counties; and ſo by
my foregoing Diſcourſe I leave you to conſider, whether
it be not a matter both imprudent and unpracticable. I
now come to his Fourth Anſwer made to the Objection
raiſed by himſelf.</p>

Churches not deemed competent to take, or make a regular
Trial of them, yet why ſhould not thoſe who are Authorized as

judged competent for their Trial? <hi>Whom he means by the
perſons authorized for Ordination, is evident by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

would not any man ſmile to ſee Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> whoſe pride it
was heretofore to be pulling down all the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in

               <p>5. That which he brings in as his <hi>Fifth Anſwer,</hi> offers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Expoſtulation againſt the <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> thus: <hi>Why ſhould
theſe men be made Triers? Is no vein of men meet to make
Triers but theſe?</hi> He is in great pain becauſe of theſe; <hi>Any
Tooth good Barber,</hi> let me have any thing rather than theſe,
who (as he ſaith) <hi>keep Labourers out of the Vineyard.</hi> By
all means (I pray you) down with theſe that keep the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Bores</hi> out from rooting up the vines, and the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Foxes</hi> from ſpoiling the tender grapes.</p>
               <p>6. And therefore in the ſixth place, rather than indure
theſe any longer, he is content there ſhould be either no
<hi>Approbation</hi> at all, or elſe that it ſhould be left in the hands
of the <hi>ſeveral Pariſhes of the Nation;</hi> which (all things
perpended) would be a worthy way, eſpecially conſidering
the Faction of ſome, the Ignorance of many, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy
and Profaneneſs of too many of the Pariſhes. Of
this I have ſaid ſomewhat in the fore-going part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
where, though you will find Reaſons enough againſt
it, and that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> (of all other men) hath the leaſt
reaſon to plead for a Parochial Power, yet ſeeing he hath,
in his giddy fit of Scribling, been willing to run the round,
to court all Parties and Orders of men to joyn with him
againſt the Eſtabliſhment of the Commiſſioners, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Authority of his Highneſs and the Parliament;
therefore I ſhall take a little pains more to ſee what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alledged by this popular Advocate on the behalf of the
Pariſhes; which though it be but Folly in me to do, yet for
fear the Man's Followers ſhould ſay his Book had no full
Anſwer, I ſhall deal with him according to his Folly, leſt
he grow too wiſe in his own conceit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it be againſt Reaſon, that the Magiſtrate
ſhould reſtrain men from hiring or entertaining Servants, ſuch
as they conceive would be moſt ſerviceable and uſefull to them
in their affairs; or that he ſhould appoint others to aſſign them
what ſervants they pleaſe; much more unreaſonable is it, that
greater Bodies and Societies of men ſhould not be permitted to
have ſuch to ſerve them in ſpiritual Affairs, as they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
are moſt like to build them up in ſound knowledge, and
pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mote the intereſt of their Souls.</hi> Is not this, think ye, a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52973:73"/>
ſingular Argument? But for Anſwer in brief. 1. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but note the compariſon as odious, betwixt Domeſtick
and Spiritual Servants, ſeeing theſe latter are called <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers
Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Fathers,</hi> (with other terms of
honour) as well as Servants (which they are in a ſenſe too)
for the ſake of Chriſt and his Goſpel; and as they have
Titles of honour, ſo they have Priviledges correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which ordinary Servants have not. 2. The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
will by no means hold in reaſon, becauſe the meaneſt
of men have uſually skill enough to make choice of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Servants fit for their Turn: But there are but few men
in the beſt Pariſhes, and in moſt of them not one of skill
and knowledge ſufficient to judge of a man, whether he be
qualified with Spiritual gifts and graces to enable him to
ſerve them in Spiritual things. 3. Suppoſe ſome men in
ſome Pariſhes may be of ability in matter of knowledge to
judge, yet thoſe that are able to judge in matter of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and moſt men that have knowledge in the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
do yet want grace in the heart, and ſo it will be ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that they will have the Will to approve an able or
a gratious man to be a Preacher. 4. Suppoſe yet further,
that the knowing men of a Pariſh ſhould be willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
a knowing and a gratious man; yet the reſt of the
Pariſh, who have a ſhare in the Suffrage, may be of another
minde, for ſome reſpects of their own, and pretend it would
be more for the Intereſt of their ſouls to have another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
5. Conſider, that Pariſhes being Bodies and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of men, the Magiſtrate hath an Intereſt in them as
they are a Corporation or Community, and though men
have a right to do as they will at home in Private Affairs,
yet he may (according to the laudable Conſtitution of all
Commonweals) interpoſe ſo far in all thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they Act by Suffrage as a Community; as to reſtrain them
from, or limit them in Acting in ſuch matters, which are
of more immediate concernment to himſelf. 6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
laſtly, though the Miniſter or Preacher to be approved
be to be in ſome ſenſe a Servant, a Servant to the Pariſh, in
things Spiritual; yet he is not to be ſo much their Servant,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52973:73"/>
as the Servant of Chriſt in the firſt place; Then, being not
in a private, but in a Publick Relation to the whole Pariſh,
and upon a Publick accompt, he in the next place is alſo to
be reputed the Servant of the Magiſtrate; partly as he is to
officiate on the Magiſtrates behalf towards the Community
of the Pariſh, and partly becauſe he is to have a Publick
Maintenance from the Magiſtrate: For, though Tythes
and other Duties ariſe out of the Pariſhes, yet they are not
of the Legal Propriety of the Pariſhioners, becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
hath been otherwiſe antiently diſpoſed of, and ſetled
by the Law of the Land, to enable the Magiſtrate to hold
forth and uphold a Publick Profeſſion of the Chriſtian
Faith within the ſeveral places of the Nation. So that theſe
things being conſidered, it is vain for Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to plead
for a Right of Power in Pariſhes to <hi>Approve,</hi> upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that the Miniſter or Preacher to be Approved is to
be their Servant, ſeeing though in one ſenſe (<hi>viz.</hi> Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
he is to ſerve them, yet by reaſon of his Civil Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Dependencie, he is not their, but the Publick
Servant of the State, for the good of the Pariſh, in that
Employment.</p>
               <p>But Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> to fright the Magiſtrate, tels him, that
<hi>it is a Crime in him to be medling with ſuch ſacred Edge-Tool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
as the Authoritative forcible impoſing of Miniſters
upon Pariſhes.</hi> All this will not take off the Edge of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Magiſtrate, who knows that having a Revenue in
his hand to promote the preaching of the Goſpel, it is his
duty, as he is a Chriſtian man, to do his utmoſt to ſee it
well beſtowed that way, by maintaining able and gracious
men in doing the work, and when any of them is ſent to a
Pariſh, it cannot be ſo ſaid, that the ſetling of him there is an
Authoritative forcing of the Pariſh to receive him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that it is a Pious Proviſion for the Pariſh by the Care of
Authority. Nor let any man deceive his own heart by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus; That becauſe when a Miniſter or Preacher is ſo
ſent and ſettled, the Pariſh have no power to refuſe him,
therefore the not having power to refuſe him, is all one as
if he were forced upon them: For if ſuch a Conſtruction
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52973:74"/>
might be made, then by the ſame way it might be argued,
that when his Highneſs ſends down perſons into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to perform any office of Truſt, the execution whereof
is warranted by Law, ſuppoſe it be in the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as when he ſends down Sheriffs; you know then
the Counties have no power to refuſe them; and yet this
never was, nor can it be reputed a forcing of Sheriffs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Counties; becauſe as his Highneſs hath a lawful
power to ſend and ſettle ſuch Officers as Sheriffs, ſo the
Counties are by Law concerned to receive, and by Law
cannot refuſe them, becauſe their liberty of refuſal is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by that lawful obedience which they owe to his
Highneſs: So in this caſe of his Highneſs ſending Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
legally preſented and approved to Pariſhes, the Pariſhes
not having liberty to refuſe them, cannot be reputed
equivalent to a forcing men upon them, becauſe their
liberty of Refuſal is determined by the Law, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
them to receive them, and ſo no injury is done
them by force or conſtraint; foraſmuch as no man or
company of men ought to preſume or pretend any further
liberty in any Nation, than the Laws of that Nation do
allow. 'Tis pitty ſo much Ink and Time ſhould be loſt
about the cleering of ſo plain a buſineſs: But 'tis for the
ſake of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and his Admirers, that he may not too much
admire himſelf, nor they believe him impregnable, when
they ſee his Arguments are no <hi>Edge tools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He goeth on to preſent another ſcruple to the Magiſtrate,
telling him, <hi>If he ſend Miniſters to Pariſhes, and they prove
either inſufficient, negligent, or wicked; then the blood of the
ſouls in thoſe Pariſhes which periſh, will fall upon his head:
whereas if the ſouls of the people periſh through the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
or unfaithfulneſs of a Miniſtry of their own choice and
approbation, their blood will be required of their Miniſters,
in caſe the people did at the time of approving them uſe their
beſt care and circumſpection in the buſineſs.</hi> This is the ſum
of the ſtory; and a ſhrewd one it is indeed, that carrieth
its own confutation in the belly: For, if he would lay the
guilt of the blood of the Peoples ſouls upon the Miniſters
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52973:74"/>
choſen and approved by the ſaid People, if ſo be they (to
wit the People) did their beſt to judge aright of them when
they choſe and approved them; then, upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Reaſon, I can acquit the Magiſtrate from the
danger of incurring a guilt of the blood of ſouls, if he did
his beſt, by himſelf or his Deputies, to judge aright of the
Miniſters by due Trial and Examination, before he ſent
them to their reſpective Pariſhes; and muſt caſt it upon
the Miniſters, if they ſhall, notwithſtanding the care of
the Magiſtrate or his Deputies, afterwards degenerate, and
prove unfit, or unfaithful in their places.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place (ſaith he) if it be alleadged, <hi>that danger
be likely to befall the State or Government, by allowing Pariſhes
the Approbation of their own Miniſters, the truth is, the
danger is like to be greater by their being denied it.</hi> And why
ſo forſooth? He like a wiſe Stateſman (for no leſs he
takes himſelf to be) tells us, <hi>Becauſe States never ſuffer'd
by indulging their people in things reaſonable and juſt; but
their witholding from them their due rights, hath ſtill been
exasperating and provoking.</hi> Thus you ſee how he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
to exaſperate the people againſt the State, about
this buſineſs; inſinuating into vulgar minds a ſuppoſition
of a Right of chuſing and approving publick Miniſters
and Preachers to be in themſelves. This is to indulge
the diſcontented humors of ſome men, by filling their
heads with Falſhoods and unreaſonable Phantſies, that
have no other ground but his bare ſuggeſtion: which is
ſo much the more vile, becauſe attended by ſo many ſelf-contradictions.
For (as I have already told you) in ſome
places of his Book he endeavoureth to faſten the Right
both of Chuſing and Approving only upon Patrons, in
oppoſition to the preſent <hi>Commiſſioners for Approbation.</hi>
Then flitting thence, he pleads for it as the better Right
of the <hi>Gather'd Churches.</hi> Afterwards he brings it in
head and ſhoulder for the <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> In another place,
he would beſtow it upon ſome new <hi>County-Commiſſioners;</hi>
and not ſlicking there, he becomes a ſtiff pleader for the
whole Right to be in <hi>Pariſhes.</hi> So that what he hath
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52973:75"/>
denied in ſeveral places, intimating that there ought to
be no Approbation at all, calling it a <hi>Project</hi> in one
place, a <hi>Device,</hi> a <hi>Contrivance,</hi> a <hi>Stratagem,</hi> a <hi>Politick
Engine,</hi> and I know not what more; yet he grants it in
other places, and hath been pleaſed to allow of it here
at the latter end of his Book, and would once again ſtick
it as a feather in the Cap of his beſt Friends, the <hi>Churches;</hi>
and if they take it not, then he would beſtow it upon his
Adverſaries, or ſtrangers, or any where, ſo it might not
reſt in the hands of the Commiſſioners, whom he is pleaſed
to purſue with a whole Army of Slanders and Abuſes, as
his greateſt Adverſaries, though implicitely he juſtifies
the right and neceſſity of their Imployment.</p>
               <p>But admit that the power he pretends to plead for in
Pariſhes, were ſo ſetled, is it not worthy conſideration
what might be the conſequence?</p>
               <p>1. The Legal Right of Patrons (that of the Magiſtrate
as <hi>Patron Paramount,</hi> and of all inferior Patrons, whoſe
cauſe he hath ſo earneſtly defended elſwhere) muſt be
yielded up and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>2. The way of ſecuring and upholding a Publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Goſpel in the Nation by the Magiſtrate, will
be utterly loſt.</p>
               <p>3. In ſtead of a publick Profeſſion, there will be no
other but a private Profeſſion of every particular Pariſh;
So that if (according to Mr. <hi>Roger Williams) Judaiſm,
Turciſm, Papiſm,</hi> or any thing elſe come in, what remedy?
For, ſuppoſe it ſhould pleaſe the Pariſh, and be brought
in among them to juſtle out the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity,
who can help it? ſeeing their Patron Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith,
they ought to exerciſe a Right to chooſe and enjoy whom
they pleaſe; and therefore he may even ſhake hands again
here with his brother <hi>Williams,</hi> and as well leave them to
chooſe what Religion they pleaſe into all the Pariſhes of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> This is it both their wiſdoms tend to:
For, ſaith the ſame Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> in that Book of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Propoſals for propagating the Goſpel: <hi>Is it not
more conducible a thouſand-fold to the peoples eternal welfare,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52973:75"/>
that each Town and Diviſion of people in the Land be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
permitted to make a Stand, to examine and choſe their
way of Worſhip, Miniſtry, and Maintenance? Yea, whether
or no is it not abſolutely better, that they did freely chooſe
rather a falſe Religion (Jewiſh, Popiſh, Turkiſh, &amp;c.) than
without their free choice, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed up in a way of Traditional
and Cuſtomary Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. If Pariſhes ſhould have Right to chooſe and approve,
then they ought alſo to have a power to eject; elſe what
would the other ſignifie? ſeeing otherwiſe after a Choice
once made, they would during that mans days, be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remedy, though afterwards they ſhould beleeve they
have committed an Error in chuſing him, or have a deſire
to be rid of him: Beſides, if Pariſhes had or were to have
ſuch a Right, what a pickle would moſt of the godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Pariſhes be in throughout <hi>England?</hi> What ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
could they have for any long enjoyment of their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſeeing that mens minds in Pariſhes are mutable? and
though when they firſt came among them, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
willing enough to have them, yet in caſe thoſe
Pious men that firſt occaſioned their coming, ſhall
remove from the Pariſh to live elſewhere, or die, then
perhaps men of another Temper may be the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
party of a Pariſh, and think fit to eject them, to make
room for others more ſutable to their own diſpoſition;
and ſo, if the Law and the Magiſtrate were once concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no further than to look on, with his hands in his Pocket,
who then could help them? What would become of the
pious Miniſtry of <hi>England,</hi> after a little ſeaſon?</p>
               <p>5. If Pariſhes had ſuch a Right, that their Miniſters were
ſolely to depend upon them both for choice and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it would be a great Temptation upon many to turn
<hi>men-pleaſers</hi> that were once otherwiſe, ſo it would be an
occaſion to fill Pariſhes with ſuch Preachers onely as would
ſow Pillows under the elbows of their Pariſhioners, and
not diſ-oblige them by any ſuch Doctrines as might unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
them in their Lees, and diſturbe their Corruptions;
Preachers that would be ſlaves to the very Vaſſals of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52973:76"/>
rather than Miniſters or Servants of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>6. As the generally of Pariſhes are too ignorant, ſo had
they a power to do in this caſe what they pleaſe, it would
ſoon be found they would like none but ſuch as themſelves.
The <hi>High-Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and had he once the power pleaded for by Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
the next News we ſhould hear of him would be, that
he is ſeeking out for ſome <hi>miſerable Levite</hi> to contract un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand
with him for Half-Tithes or Quarter-Tithes, or
what other Maintenance ſoever it be, before he will admit
him; and ſo inſtead of having a generous publick main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for a Learned and Pious Miniſtry, there would be
hard-meat, hardly an allowance of <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r John,</hi> for a <hi>Sir
John</hi> in every Pariſh; by which means, the poverty and
inſufficiency of the Miniſtry would ſoon be reduced to an
equal Standard, and men might be ſure to run headlong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Hell at an eaſie rate, and have no body to ſtop them.</p>
               <p>7. Laſtly, I ſuppoſe 'tis well known to Mr <hi>G.</hi> that the
generality of Pariſhes, as they are profane and ignorant,
ſo they are no leſſe <hi>Malignant</hi> againſt Authority; and he
(in effect) acknowledgeth it.</p>
               <p>For, in the laſt place (and with it he cloſeth up his
Book) rather than Pariſhes ſhould not exerciſe ſuch a
Power,<note place="margin">Mr <hi>G.</hi> his pleadings for Malignant P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>achers.</note> he cares not though they were all ſtocked with
Miniſters and Preachers of the ſame Character through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Nation, and therefore pleads aloud on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
which doubtleſs he hath reaſon to do, he and they
being generally allied to each other, in one common
cauſe of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> whereof that ſort of men have been
the great Defenders. For (ſaith he) <hi>admit a Miniſter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the People of a Pariſh prove of a Malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
ſo may a Miniſter, though with the Triers, paſſe. This
is no Amulet or Charm againſt Malignancie.</hi> Tis not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but 'tis poſſible that a Malignant may give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
a ſlip through Trial and Approbation: But
then he muſt be very cunning, and a man of a very conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
converſation, that no knowledg ſhould be had of him;
otherwiſe, though they have neither <hi>Amulet</hi> nor <hi>Charm,</hi>
they are uſually able enough to ſpell him, as well as other
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52973:76"/>
Friends of Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and keep the Devil of Malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
from running to poſſeſſe the Swine of the Pariſh, and
hurry them to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Moreover (ſaith he) <hi>If a Miniſter's Tongue prove at any
time Malignant in the Pulpit, there is another Miniſter, the
Magiſtrate, at hand to reſtrain him.</hi> Tis well he will allow the
Magiſtate may do ſomthing: This is indeed a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for putting Malignant Preachers into Pariſhes to finde
work for the Magiſtrate to reſtrain them, or put them out
(it ſeems the Magiſtrate wants work:) But is it likely, that
the Pariſh who choſe their Preacher in, &amp; upon that Account
may be conceived to be all of his own humor, will inform
againſt him? Or is it convenient for the Magiſtrate to
maintain Spies in every Pariſh to bring him information?
Or muſt the correction of the ſaid Malignant be left to that
Magiſtrate called the Conſtable, or High Conſtable, or the
Juſtice of Peace, who may perhaps be an Inhabitant of the
Pariſh, or of ſome Neighbour-Pariſh, where they alſo
and their Preacher may (by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s favour alſo) be
all of the ſame Complexion? Pray (<hi>Sir</hi>) reſolve us of theſe
Points in your next <hi>Plea for Malignancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he adds further, <hi>that the greateſt danger threatning
the State from Malignant Miniſters, is not by the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they may have of Publick Preaching, clandeſtine Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Conſultations, Irritations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the plotting and
practiſing whereof they may have more leaſure and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by being tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n off, or put by their Employment of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
Thus you ſee what malice againſt the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi>
hath brought him to. He, in other places of his Book, hath
manifeſted a ſpleen ſufficiently againſt his Highneſs, for
erecting of the Commiſſioners; now then what remains
in the next place to be expected, but that he who would
knock down the Commiſſioners, to make room in Pariſnes
for <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>'s Chaplains, may ere long be of a minde
to print down his Highneſs, to make room for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
—Would any man, whoſe Sences were not ſodden
in the very dregs of diſcontent, plead thus openly for them,
in a matter that might be of apparent prejudice to the

Publick ſafety For whence is it that Plottings uſually
ariſe? is it not from falſe conceptions, miſtakes, and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of Affairs inſtilled into People's minds? And
what more ready way to poyſon the judgements and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the People touching the Princes Actions and
Concernments, than that their Teachers ſhould be diſ-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to him and his Proceedings? Is it not from hence,
that the people may be eaſily made fit matter for Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and malleable to the deſigns of men averſe to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?
What though they ſhould be ſo wiſe as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
open expreſſions in Pulpits? yet is it not known, a
diſcourſe may be ſo artificially and craftily contrived, that
by remote oblique hints and ſecrets wipes, (which tickle
more then down-right language) the vulgar ſort are ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
charmed out of their good affections? Have we not
ſeen this by experience? and admit this were not; yet do
we not know the generality to be led by the example of
their Miniſter? Whom if they know to be Malignant, they
uſually take after him, and his very ordinary converſe
from houſe to houſe is more then a thouſand Sermons.
Would any man then that were not as ill-affected as they,
plead for the maintaining of them in all the Pariſhes of the
Nation? Good Sir, let the Magiſtrate have leave to diſpoſe
of the Publick maintenance in Pariſhes to perſons well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
and be you your ſelf pleaſed, with the other <hi>Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters</hi>
of your own complexion, to leave playing the
Foxes, and love the Peace of the Church, more then your
own private ends and proud humours, then your <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
will be leſs confident in their wayes, and ſo on all
ſides there will be little cauſe to fear any further plottings,
or practiſes of Inſurrection among the people.</p>
               <p>But Mr <hi>G.</hi> hath not done yet; for, as it is one point of
his anger, that his Highneſs will not maintain them; ſo he
makes it the laſt ground of his quarrel, that the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
will not approve of them; and with this he ſhuts his
Book; for, ſaith he, <hi>when perſons ſomwhat (it may be) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignantly
enclined, ſhall be contumeliouſly intreated by the
State, or by their Officers, as ſuppoſe any of them ſhould be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52973:77"/>
made to drink of the</hi> Triers <hi>Cup of reprobation, is not this a
direct way or means to awaken and ſet on work ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination?</hi>
Here you ſee, his care is not ſo much for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as for them; and by this judge, whether he be
not more for Them than for the Government. What if
through Malignancie, they be enclined to Treat the State
contumeliouſly? That is a ſmall matter in the eye of Mr <hi>G.</hi>
becauſe therein himſelf may ſhake hands with them as a
brother, having in this Book made as bold that way
as any of them, and therefore 'tis contumeliouſly done of
the State to animadvert upon their Malignancy, and a crime
in the Commiſſioners, becauſe they will not break their
Truſt by giving an Approbation, to enable them to Treat
the State with contumelie in publick before all the People.
This is the Inference; and the ſum of his Diſcourſe about
the matter amounts to this: When Preachers are enclined
to the higheſt miſchief that may be in a Nation, if the State,
or their Officers, do take a reaſonable Courſe to prevent
the miſchief, they thereby contumeliouſly handle thoſe
Preachers, and it were better to let them be actually doing
miſchief, than irritate their malignant Inclinations, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
them of the opportunity to rob the State of the
hearts of the People. This would make an Argument to
prove as well, that Robbers ſhould be let alone upon the
Rode, and Cut-throats in the City, rather than the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of them and their Companions ſhould be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
by a contumelious ſending them to Gaol, to keep
them from doing further miſchief. It would be every jot
as wiſe a Concluſion for the toleration of them, and all
other Offenders, as that of Mr <hi>G.</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Preachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, he breathes the utmoſt of his Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in theſe words, (ERGO) <hi>Therefore the Politick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
ſuggeſted in the Argument in Countenance of the</hi>
Triers, <hi>and their Conſtitution, is clearly anti-politick, and
frowns rather than ſmiles upon their Conſiſtory. And ſo</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>if Policy having weighed them in her Balance, finde
them wanting; and Religion having weighed them in the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52973:78"/>
Balance of the Sanctuary, hath found them yet wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing
more: let their Kingdom be divided, and given to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
of the Land.</hi> That is to ſay, to the <hi>Pariſhes;</hi> for,
theſe are the Congregations he intends in this Place: By
which it is evident, that as many of the former Paſſages
of his Book are contradictory to each other; ſo what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
ſoever he made before, on the behalf of <hi>Patrons,</hi>
the <hi>Gather'd Churches, Presbyteries,</hi> and others, he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth
all now; 'twas not out of any reſpect to them, but
onely to colour his corrupt deſign of exaſperating all ſorts
of men, for an overthrowing the preſent Eſtabliſhment of
<hi>Commiſſioners for Approbation,</hi> ſeeing after all he looks
over the left ſhoulder, with Scorn and Contempt upon the
other Parties, and in oppoſition to them all, concludeth on
the behalf of <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> whom in groſs he would prefer as
the moſt competent <hi>Approvers.</hi> But notwithſtanding all
that ever he hath ſaid, the foregoing <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
raiſed by himſelf, on the behalf of the Commiſſioners,
ſtands yet far more conſiderable than all his pretended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
thereunto, which being found ſo mean, ſurely no
man will look ſo low as to frown at them, though many
may ſmile; but eſpecially at his <hi>Eighteen Arguments,</hi> in
the managing whereof, he hath (you ſee) proved himſelf
no leſs ſcandalous than vain in reference to <hi>Religion,</hi> and
carried the matter as illogically in this, as in moſt of his
other Scripts, which whoſoever reads with a judicious
eye, will hardly beleeve the man was ever acquainted with
the <hi>Schools of Reaſon,</hi> and will (I dare ſay) readily ſubſcribe
