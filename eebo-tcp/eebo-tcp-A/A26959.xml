            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe firſt year of my Miniſtry I fell into a doubt about Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; and I was ſo ignorant as not to underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that ſolemn Covenant and Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Parents duty of entring the Child into the Covenant with God, and what the Vow was which then was made: when time, and light had ſatisfied me, I retained as charitable thoughts of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> as of almoſt any that I differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from. About <hi>1646, 1647, 1648.</hi> they made more ſtir among us than before: Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> living near me, we continued in peace, not talking of our difference; For I purpoſely avoided it in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
<pb facs="tcp:48465:3"/>
unleſs any asked my opinion. At laſt his Converts came to me, and told me that if I would not anſwer him in writing, they muſt take it as an encouragement to them to be Baptized; and confeſſed that he ſent them, or that they came by his conſent: To avoid long writings, one dayes diſpute was thought a ſhorter way. That diſpute with many additions I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to publiſh; with ſome returns to ſome after arguings of Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s. He wrote what he thought meet on the other ſide. I thought I had done with that work for ever: But in <hi>1655</hi> he ſent to me again, and drew from me the Letters here recited. Theſe without my conſent he publiſhed with an anſwer in the midſt of a great Book: I left his anſwer theſe nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, or thereabouts, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; as alſo the reſt of his books againſt me. I thought it not lawful for me to waſte my precious time on things ſo little neceſſary: A man may find words at length to ſay for almoſt any cauſe. I partly know what can be ſaid againſt this, and every book that I have written. And I know what I can Reply. And I partly foreknow what they can ſay to that Reply, and what I can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay in the defence of it; and ſo talk
<pb facs="tcp:48465:3"/>
on till we have wrangled away our <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and our Time:</hi> and muſt all this be printed, to enſnare poor readers? But at laſt Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath laid a neceſſity upon me: I had ſilently paſt over all his vain Reaſonings, and all his accuſations of my writings, and all his falſifications of Authors, had he not called me ſo loud to repent of ſlandering ſome for being Baptized naked: And when I found it my duty to ſpeak to that, I thought it fit to ſay ſomewhat of the reſt, paſſing by what Mr. <hi>Wills.</hi> hath done more fully in an anſwer to his book.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of men called <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> among us: The one ſort are ſober Godly Chriſtians, who when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized to ſatisfie their Conſciences, live among us in Chriſtian Love and peace; and I ſhall be aſhamed if I Love not them as heartily, and own them not as peaceably, as any of them ſhall do either me or better men than I that differ from them. The other ſort hold it unlawful to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſuch as are not of their mind and way, and are ſchiſmatically troubleſome and unquiet, in labouring to increaſe their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Theſe are they that offend me, and other lovers of peace. And if God would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them but ſeriouſly to think of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:48465:4"/>
obvious queſtions, it might ſomewhat ſtop them. <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> How inconſiderable a part of the univerſal Church they hold communion with? And unchurch almoſt all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on Earth? <hi>Qu. 2.</hi> Whether they can poſſibly hope that ever the Church on Earth will Unite upon their terms, of rejecting all their Infants from the viſible Church, and renouncing all our Infant Rights and Benefits conferred by the Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace? <hi>Qu. 3.</hi> And whether if they continue to the worlds end, to ſeparate from almoſt all the Churches and unchurch them, their employment will not be ſtill to ſerve the great enemy of Love and Concord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord of Love and Peace, and againſt the proſperity of faith, and godlineſs, and againſt the welfare of the Church and ſouls, and to the ſcandal and hardening of the ungodly?</p>

                  <div type="preface">
                     <head>The PREFACE.</head>
                     <p n="1">§. 1. THE occaſion and time of theſe Letters is long ago publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himſelf in the third Part of his <hi>Anti-Paedobaptiſm,</hi> page 353. and forward; where he printeth the ſaid Letters without <hi>my</hi> conſent: Had I found his Anſwers ſatisfactory, I had changed my judgement and retracted that and other ſuch writings long ago. But I thought ſo much otherwiſe of them that I judged it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, nor worth my diverting from better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to write an anſwer to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. And whatever the ſingular judgement of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48465:9"/>
learned and excellent Profeſſor of Theology men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in his Preface, was or is concerning the arguments that I, and many before and ſince have uſed for Infant Baptiſm, and notwithſtanding his opinion that <hi>it was introduced in the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,</hi> &amp;c. yet ſo many wiſer and better men than I, think otherwiſe both of the cauſe, and of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s writings, that I hope the modeſt will allow me the honour of having very good company if I ſhould prove miſtaken.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. No ſober Chriſtian will deny but that Godly men of both opinions may be ſaved: And then I think no ſuch Chriſtian that is acquainted with the Hiſtory of the Church, can chooſe but think that there are now in Heaven many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, if not hundred thouſands that were not againſt Infant Baptiſm, for one that was againſt it: And while we differ <hi>de jure,</hi> yet without great ignorance of the ſtate of the world, we muſt needs agree that <hi>de facto,</hi> the number in the Church of Chriſt in all Nations and Ages that have been againſt Infant Baptiſm hath been ſo ſmall, as that they make up but a very little part of the Church triumphant: which though I take for no proof of the truth of our opinion, yet I judge it a great reaſon to make me and others very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of turning raſhly and without cogent proof to the other ſide. I know the Churches have ſtill had their blemiſhes; but that they ſhould all univerſally ſo err in the ſubject of Baptiſm and Chriſtianity it ſelf, is not to be believed till it be proved.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48465:9"/>§. 4. Though Chriſt be not the Author of any of our errors, he is the healer of them, and he is the Effector as well as the Director of his Churches faith and holineſs: And yet to ſay that though thouſands or hundred thouſands are in Heaven that were for Infant Baptiſm, for one that was againſt it, yet Chriſt was againſt even ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive part of his Church (as accounted) is not to be received without good proof.</p>
                     <p n="5">§. 5. For my part I muſt ſtill ſay, that after all that I have read for the Anabaptiſts, and much more than ſuch Catalogues as Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> I do not at preſent remember that I have read of any one Chriſtian that held the baptizing of Infants unlawful, in many and many hundred years after Chriſt; at leaſt not any that denied not Original ſin: Though indeed the Pelagians themſelves that did deny it much, yet denied not Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p n="6">§. 6. But of this enough heretofore: I lay not my faith on the number of Conſenters; but in a doubtful caſe I think the way that almoſt all went that are in Heaven, and took it as the very entrance of the door of life, is ſafer <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> than that which few in Heaven did own: And though on earth I have more approvers than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> I think mans approbation ſo poor a comfort, as that I am ſorry to read in his Preface and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where how much he layeth upon it. Alas, were it not more for the good of others than our ſelves,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48465:10"/>
how inconſiderable a matter were it, whether men value and honour, or deſpiſe us, and what we are thought or ſaid of by each other, when we are all on the borders of eternity, where the honour of this world is of no ſignification?</p>
                     <p n="7">§. 7. In the anſwer which I muſt give to Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> ſhould I tranſcribe all his words, and anſwer every impertinent paſſage, I ſhould need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly weary the Reader and my ſelf: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe the Reader to have his Book at hand, and to take his words as he hath given him them; that I may not be blamed as concealing any of them. And I ſhall anſwer to nothing, but what ſeemeth to me to need an anſwer: And for all the reſt I am content that the impartial Reader judge of them as he findeth them: For I write not for ſuch as need an anſwer to every word that is written, how frivolous ſoever, againſt plain truth.</p>

                              <hi>Sir,</hi> I mean to ſee more ſaid againſt what I have already written, before I will write any more about Infant Baptiſm, without a more preſſing call than I yet diſcern. I have diſcharged my Conſcience, and ſhall leave you and yours to take your courſe. And indeed I do not underſtand the ſenſe of your Letter, becauſe you ſo joyn two queſtions in one, that I know not which of the two it is that you would have me anſwer to. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48465:11"/>
there were any Ordinances or Law of God that Infants ſhould be Church-members? is one queſtion: Whether this be repealed? is another: you joyn both into one. For the firſt, that Infants were Church-members, as you have not yet denied that I know of, ſo will I not be ſo uncharitable as to imagine that you are now about it: And much leſs that you ſhould have the leaſt doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were by Gods Ordination. There are two things conſiderable in the matter. Firſt, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Church-memberſhip, with all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent priviledges. It is the work of a grant or promiſe to confer theſe, and not directly of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Secondly, the duty of devoting and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the child to God, and entring it into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which confers the benefit; and this is the work of a Law or Precept to conſtitute this duty. I am paſt doubt that you doubt not of either of theſe: For you cannot imagine, that any Infant had the bleſſing without a grant or promiſe, (that's impoſſible;) nor that any Parents lay under a duty without an obliging law, (for that is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.) Taking it therefore for granted that you are reſolved in both theſe, and ſo yield that ſuch a grant and precept there was, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no queſtion but whether it be repealed: which I have long expected that you ſhould prove. For citing the particular Texts in which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is contained, though more may be ſaid than is ſaid, yet I ſhall think it needleſs, till I ſee the ordination contained in thoſe Texts which I have already mentioned to you, proved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed. Nor do I know that it is of ſo great uſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48465:11"/>
to ſtand to cite the particular Texts, while you confeſs in general, that ſuch a promiſe and precept there is, by vertue of which, Infants were till Chriſts time duly members of Chriſts Church (for Chriſts Church it was) even his univerſal viſible Church. Still remember that I take the word [law] not ſtrictly for a precept only, but largely, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending both promiſe and precept, and I have already ſhewed you both, and ſo have others.</p>
                           <p>So much of your endeavour as hath any tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the advancement of holineſs, I, am willing to ſecond you in, <hi>viz.</hi> that at the age you deſire people might ſolemnly profeſs their acceptance of Chriſt, and their reſolution to be his: But I hope God will find me better work while I muſt ſtay here, than to ſpend my time to prove that no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers are within Chriſts viſible Church, that is, are no Infant Diſciples, Infant Chriſtians, Infant Church-members. I know no glory it will bring to Chriſt, nor comfort to man, nor ſee I now any appearance of truth in it. I bleſs the Lord for the benefits of the Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that I enjoyed in infancy, and that I was dedicated ſo ſoon to God, and not left wholly in the Kingdom and power of the Devil. They that deſpiſe this mercy, or account it none, or not worth the accepting, may go without it, and take that which they get by their ingratitude. And I once hoped, that much leſs than ſuch an inundation of direful conſequents as our eyes have ſeen, would have done more for the bringing of you back to ſtop the doleful breach that you have made. I am fain to ſpend my time now to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery

of ſome of your Opinion who are lately turned Quakers, or at leaſt the preventing of others Apoſtaſie: which is indeed to prevent the emptying of your Churches. Which I ſuppoſe will be a more acceptable work with you, than again to write againſt rebaptizing, or for Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.

Wherefore ſtill I preſs you that you would ſhew me where that Law, Ordinance, Statute or Decree of God is that is repealable, that is, which may in congruous ſence be either by a later act ſaid to be repealed, or elſe to be eſtabliſhed as a law for ever.

                              <hi>Sir,</hi> The tranſeunt fact of God, whereby In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were viſible Church-members, was plainly expreſt in my laſt to you, to be the taking of the whole people of the Jews for his people, which is the expreſſion of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 4.34. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.7. And by it I mean that which is expreſſed <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.24.26. when God ſaid, <hi>I have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you from other people, that you ſhould be mine.</hi> The ſame thing is expreſſed 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.53. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.1. This I term [fact] as conceiving it moſt comprehenſive of the many particular acts in many generations, whereby he did accompliſh it. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing herein <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.2. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.7. I conceive it began when he called <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r, Gen.</hi> 12.1. to which ſucceeded in their times the enlarging of his family, removing of <hi>Lot, Iſhmael,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Keturah, Eſau,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by Circumciſion, the birth of <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> his leading to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> increaſe there, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval to <hi>Canaan,</hi> to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> placing, preſerving there, and chiefly the bringing of them thence, to which principally the Scripture refers this fact, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.45. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. the bringing them into the bond of the Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> giving them laws, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling their Prieſthood, tabernacle, army, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inheritance. By which fact the Infants of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were viſible Church-members as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in like manner though not with equal right (for they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48465:13"/>
might be ſold away) were the bought ſervants or captives, whether Infants or of age, though their Parents were profeſſed Idolaters. And this I ſaid was without promiſe or precept, meaning ſuch promiſe or precept as you in your Letter ſay I confeſs, and you deſcribe, <hi>a promiſe conferring to Infants the benefit of Church-memberſhip with all the conſequent priviledges, a precept conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the duty of devoting and dedicating the child to God, and entring into Covenant, which confers the benefit.</hi> For though I grant the promiſes to the natural poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. and the Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. wherein <hi>Iſrael</hi> avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and a precept of Circumciſion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> of calling the people, and requiring them to enter into Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. Yet no ſuch particular promiſe concerning Infants viſible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, or precept for Parents or others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſolemn admiſſion of Infants as viſible Church-members, beſides Circumciſion, as in your Book of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> you aſſert. Nor do I conceive that Infants of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were made viſible Church-members by the promiſes in the covenants or the precepts forenamed, but by Gods tranſeunt fact which I have deſcribed. Which I therefore term [tranſeunt] becauſe done in time, and ſo not eternal, and paſt, and ſo not in congruous ſence repealable as a law, ordinance, ſtatute, decree, which determines ſuch a thing ſhall be for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though capable of continuance in the ſame or the like acts, or of interruption. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48465:14"/>
or interruption is known by narration of what God hath done, not by any legal revocation, or renewing, or continuance of a promiſe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept concerning that thing. Now as the Church-memberſhip of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> began as I conceive with <hi>Abrahams</hi> call, and was compleated when they were <hi>brought out of Aegypt to God, Exod.</hi> 19.4. ſo I conceive it ceaſed when upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Chriſt as was fore-told <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. they were broken off from being Gods people, which was compleated at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> when the temple was deſtroyed, as Chriſt fore-told, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.43, 44. And inſtead of the Jewiſh people by the preaching of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by mighty ſigns, God gathered to himſelf a Church of another frame in a ſpiritual way, according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. in which he included not Infants, the Jews themſelves were no part of the Chriſtian Church without repentance and faith in Chriſt profeſſed at leaſt.</p>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> TO make any clear work upon the things in queſtion, we muſt neceſſarily ſpeak to the queſtions diſtinctly, many of which you too much confound. The firſt queſtion in order fit to be reſolved is, [whether Infants before Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation were Church-members, or not?] you grant they were: and therefore this is paſt diſpute with us. The ſecond queſtion and the firſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is [what Church it is that Infants were members of?] This you give me occaſion to take in the way, becauſe you twice explain your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when you confeſs them Church-members, by an [<hi>i. e.</hi> of the congregation of Iſrael.] By which you ſeem to imply two things: Firſt, that none but the Infants of the Congreation of Iſrael were Church-members: Secondly, that the infants of Iſrael were members of no Church but what is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48465:16"/>
convertible with the congregation of Iſrael.] The third queſtion is, what it is that gives the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites that denomination of [the Congregation of Iſrael] of which Infants were members? For you jumble both together, both cauſes Civil, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, and of both thoſe that make to the being and well-being. So that our enquiry muſt be, whether the Congregation and the Commonwealth be the ſame thing in your ſenſe?] and what conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth it formally? For in this you ſpeak in dark ambiguities. The fourth queſtion is, [Whether there was any Law, Ordinance or Precept of God concerning mans duty herein, or obliging him to the Covenant acceptance and engagement, and ſo to memberſhip; and any promiſe, grant or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, conferring the right of Church-memberſhip and the conſequent priviledges to Infants?] To this you ſay both Yea and Nay, if I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you, or at leaſt as to much of the queſtion concerning the being, and part of the effect of the precept and promiſe. Yet you conclude, that you [do not conceive that Infants of Iſrael were made viſible Church-members by the promiſes in the Covenants, or the precepts fore-named, but by Gods tranſeunt fact.] I will not ſuſpect that you imagine any other promiſe doth it beſides that in the Covenant, becauſe your tying the effect to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeunt fact doth exclude them. Here we are caſt upon theſe queſtions next. The fifth queſtion, [Whether there be ſuch precepts and promiſes as you grant, (or as I ſhall prove) which yet make not Infants Church-members?] The ſixth queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, [Whether there be any tranſeunt fact of God,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48465:16"/>
which without the efficiency of precept or promiſe did make the Infants of Iſrael Church-members?] The ſeventh queſtion, [Whether thoſe which you have aſſigned be ſuch facts?] The eighth queſtion, [Which are the Texts of Scripture that contain or expreſs the ſaid laws, precepts, or grants which I maintain?] this you inſiſt upon. The ninth queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, [Whether ſuch laws, preceps or grants as I ſhall prove, are capable of a repal or revocation?] The tenth queſtion, [Whether they are actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked or repealed?]</p>

                           <hi>R.

And I think that even that is not eaſie to do. For when I deſired your plain, exact and full explication of one word [tranſeunt fact] and you tell me you have plainly, fully and exactly told me your meaning: It falls out, either through the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py darkneſs of my own underſtanding, or yours, that I know but little more of your mind than I did before, and that you ſeem to me to have raiſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48465:17"/>
more doubts and darkneſs than you have reſolved and diſſipated. Yet being thus far drawn in, I ſhall briefly ſay ſomewhat to the ſeveral queſtions, not following your deſires to anſwer one alone: which cannot be done to any purpoſe while the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going are unreſolved, becauſe it is the clearing up of truth, and not the ſerving of your preſent ends in your writings now in hand that I muſt intend.</p>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> THE firſt queſtion being reſolved that Infants were once Church-members, to the reſolving of the ſecond queſtion, I ſhall prove theſe two Propoſitions. <hi>1.</hi> That it was not only the Infants of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were Church-members. <hi>2.</hi> The Infants of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were members of the univerſal viſible Church, and not only of that particular Congregation. The firſt I have proved already in my book. And <hi>1. Iſaac</hi> was a Church-member, yet none of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it was not <hi>Iſrael</hi> till <hi>Jacobs</hi> days. If you ſay that by the [Congregation of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48465:17"/>
                           <hi>Iſrael</hi>] you mean [the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> which had the promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi>] Yet <hi>2.</hi> I ſay, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed by <hi>Keturah</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> had none of the promiſe, and yet were Church-members in their infancy. [In <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy ſeed be called] that is, that ſeed which had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And ſo it was confined to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who got the bleſſing and the birthright, which <hi>Eſau</hi> loſt, and was excluded, yet was of the Church from his infancy. The Son of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman was not to be heir with the Son of the free-woman, yet was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> an Infant member. If you ſay, that by [the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi>] you mean all the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> I add, <hi>3.</hi> The children of his bond-men born in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or bought with mony, were none of <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed, and yet were Church-members in their infancy. If you go yet further, and ſay, that by [the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi>] you mean all that were at the abſolute diſpoſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> or his ſucceſſors, and ſo were his own: I add, <hi>4.</hi> The Infants of free Proſelytes were none ſuch, and yet were Church-members. If you yet go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, that you mean by [the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſrael</hi>] any that came under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Abraham</hi> or his ſucceſſors: then I add, <hi>5.</hi> That the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> Gen. <hi>34.</hi> were not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it was not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48465:18"/>
the bare external ſign that <hi>Jacob</hi> or his ſons would perſwade them to, without the thing ſignified: For the reproach that they mentioned of giving their daughter to the uncircumciſed, was not in the defect of the external abſciſſion; for ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> own ſon, and all the Iſraelites in the wilderneſs ſhould have been under the ſame reproach, and all the females continually: But it was in that they were not in Covenant with the ſame God, and did not profeſs to worſhip the ſame God in his true way of worſhip as they did. And therefore as Baptizing is not indeed and in Scripture ſence Baptizing, if it be not uſed for engagement to God, even into his name; ſo Circumciſion is not indeed and in Scripture ſence Circumciſion, unleſs it be uſed as an engaging ſign, and they be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed to God.</p>

                        <p>R. B. <hi>IT was then the duty of all the Nations round about (if not of all the Nations on earth, that could have information of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion) to engage themſelves and their children to God by Circumciſion.

One Supream Power maketh one Republick (with the ſubjects); And many Soveraigns make many Republicks (as all grant): Therefore if all the Nations about had <hi>engraffed themſelves</hi> into the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> but as the <hi>Sichemites</hi> did, they had not made one Republick, as to humane Soveraignty: I preſume to tell you my thoughts of ſuch a caſe (and ſo of the <hi>Sichemites</hi>): It was the glory of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be a Theocracy: God was their Soveragin; not only as he was of all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48465:19"/>
the world (<hi>de jure</hi> and by overruling their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soveraign:) but by ſpecial Revelation doing the work a Soveraign himſelf: He made <hi>them Laws</hi> (and not <hi>Moſes</hi>): He appointed them Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains under him by Revelation: He decided caſes by Oracle: He gave them Judges that were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and acted by his extraordinary ſpirit. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> is called a King, he was but an Official Magiſtrate, Captain and Prophet: [A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up to you like unto me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] ſaith he: which had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reſpect to the form of Government and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſucceſſion, (as differing from the way of Kings which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſinfully preferred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, caſting off this ſpecial Theocracy) though ultimately it intended Chriſt. Now, this being ſo, the <hi>Sichemites</hi> or any other nations who would have taken God for <hi>their Soveraign,</hi> and come under this ſpecial prophetical Theocracy, (which Circumciſion engaged them to as reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Laws to which it bound them) had been ſo far united to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But how far might this have extended? To the reſt that he ſaith I conſent. If you will not hold to this you muſt ſay that the <hi>Sichemites</hi> were to be of the ſame Communitie with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not of the ſame Republick, which ſignifieth either ungoverned Communities or various Republicks confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating.</p>

Gods Law, Grant or Inſtrumental Covenant be made before they were born?

be an unſavory task, and I doubt it would be a much ſhorter work for one of us, (which ever it is) to enumerate the uſeful truths we hold. What I hold, be it right or wrong, I will tell the Reader as to this matter. I hold that Gods Kingdom is to be conſidered in its <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration</hi>: The firſt hath, 1. The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, 2. The Conſtitutive, 3. The final Cauſes: And in the large ſenſe it containeth, 1. <hi>Subjects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by obligation,</hi> (ſuch as Rebels are) 2. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by conſent,</hi> (or <hi>voluntary</hi>). The <hi>Efficient cauſe</hi> of the former is only Gods 1. <hi>Making</hi> them men, and <hi>Redeemed men quoad precium,</hi> and <hi>commanding their ſubjection or conſent.</hi> To the <hi>effecting of the ſecond</hi> is beſides theſe required their <hi>Actual Conſent</hi> (Parents conſenting for their Infants), without which they are but Rebels, and have no right to the benefits of the Society.</p>
                        <p>God being a King <hi>de jure</hi> before his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Conſented to, maketh a Law to man to command them to conſent and be his voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: To thoſe that conſent (as the condition) he promiſeth the intereſt and bleſſings of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt and Life; and threatneth the privation of thoſe benefits, and ſorer puniſhment to refuſing rebels: He is <hi>Lawgiver</hi> and will be <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Non-conſenters</hi>; called, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> and refuſers of Chriſt and Salvation: When men do <hi>conſent</hi> they are under his further <hi>Adminiſtring</hi> Laws. The ſaid <hi>efficient cauſes</hi> are Gods Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1. As Omnipotent Owner, 2. As Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, 3. <hi>As Sapiential Rector.</hi> 1. According to the firſt, he <hi>giveth</hi> us our <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48465:28"/>
it, and in him we Live, and Move, and Are. 2. As our <hi>Benefactor antecedent</hi> to his <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,</hi> he gave the world a <hi>Redeemer abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> and reprieved the world and us, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us all <hi>common Antecedent Mercies.</hi> 3. As the Rector <hi>de jure</hi> of men not yet <hi>conſenting,</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> abſolutely and antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any condition (of making it) on our part. This Law hath the <hi>preceptive part,</hi> commanding conſent (faith and repentance). 2. The <hi>Donative</hi> or <hi>promiſſory</hi> part, giving us Chriſt in Relation, and right to his preſent benefits, if we <hi>conſent</hi>; which is the condition. 3. And the penalty aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the Kingdom <hi>de jure,</hi> is the efficient of the <hi>conſenting Kingdom</hi>: The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration (or Actual Government) of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Kingdom,</hi> is by <hi>Legiſlation, Judgement</hi> and <hi>Execution.</hi> And the Legiſlation is, 1. For the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>particular members</hi> that ſhall from time to time be added: 2. And the Governing of them all.</p>
                        <p>Now if God have made a Law that <hi>men</hi> ſhall be received members of Chriſt and his Church if they <hi>conſent</hi> (or Repent and Believe) and former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> if they be <hi>Conſenters</hi> (or their ſeed, who conſent by them) then it is an act of <hi>diſtributive juſtice</hi> of God as <hi>Judge,</hi> to give theſe benefits to <hi>Conſenters:</hi> And to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſh an <hi>act of bounty</hi> unleſs he ſay [<hi>meer bounty</hi>] is intolerable. For God governeth us <hi>Paternally,</hi> as a <hi>Regent-benefactor:</hi> He never gave <hi>reward</hi> to a Creature, Man or Angel, which was not a <hi>Gift</hi> as to the <hi>value</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> and a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48465:29"/>
only as to the <hi>ordo conferendi &amp; ratio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendi:</hi> It is madneſs to think that we can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from God <hi>commutatively.</hi> And it's little better to <hi>think</hi> that <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>diſtributive juſtice</hi> may not conſiſt; yea that there can be any right <hi>quoad ordinem diſtribuendi</hi> from that juſtice, which is not <hi>quoad rem donatam</hi> from <hi>bounty.</hi> It is ſad therefore that the world muſt ſee, that looking all how to make good an eſpouſed cauſe, ſhould tempt ſo Ancient and Learned a Divine to ſubvert the Goſpel and all Chriſtianity: For what doth he leſs? If he talk only of <hi>members by obligation,</hi> every living man is a member: This he meaneth not. If he talk only of <hi>Conſenting voluntary Members,</hi> to ſay that God <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none to be ſuch,</hi> is to ſay that he <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none to be Chriſtians,</hi> to Repent, Believe or Conſent: To ſay that he hath <hi>made no promiſe</hi> or <hi>Donative Act</hi> in the Law of Grace, that <hi>if you conſent (repent and believe) you ſhall have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt and his Church</hi> (or be members) is to deny the very ſumm of all the Goſpel, and Baptiſm it ſelf. To ſay that God doth not as <hi>Judge execute his own Law</hi> and <hi>promiſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> this <hi>union</hi> to <hi>Conſenters,</hi> and <hi>denying</hi> it to <hi>Refuſers,</hi> is to ſay that he will not as a <hi>Judge ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Believers</hi> or <hi>condemn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers.</hi> O Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hate faction and partial diſputes that can make men overthrow all Chriſtianity, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they do.</p>

                        <p>R. B.

But there is no other poſſible way of ſuch conveyance:</hi> Ergo, <hi>we have no right till God give us right. His will ſignified createth our right. No man can have right to that which is wholly and abſolutely anothers, but by his conſent or will. This will is no way known, but by ſome ſigns of it. Theſe ſigns of ſuch a will for conveyance of right to a benefit, are a civil moral action, called a donation or gift ſimply. If the ſign be in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we commonly call it a deed of gift. If it be by word of mouth, conferring a preſent right, we call it a verbal grant or gift. If it confer only a future right, we call it a promiſe, and ſometimes a Covenant; and ſometimes the word Covenant ſignifieth both, that act which gives a preſent right, and promiſeth a continuance of it. Right being a moral or civil thing, can be no way conveyed but by a moral or civil action. A

                           <hi>R. B. 2.</hi> GOD hath expreſly called that act a Covenant or promiſe by which he conveyeth this right: which we ſhall more fully manifeſt anon when we come to it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Propoſition to be proved, is, that [there was a Law or Precept of God obliging the Parents to enter their children into Covenant and Church-memberſhip, by accepting of his offer, and re-engaging them to God.] And this is as obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and eaſie as the former. But firſt I ſhall in a word here alſo explain the terms. The word [Law] is ſometimes taken more largely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly, as comprehending the very immanent acts or the nature of God, conſidered without any ſign to repreſent it to the creature. So many call Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or purpoſes the Eternal Law: which indeed is no law, nor can be fitly ſo called. <hi>2.</hi> It is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly for [an authoritative determination <hi>de debito conſtituendo vel confirmando.</hi>] And ſo it comprehendeth all that may fitly be called a law. Some define it, <hi>[Juſſum majeſtatis obligans aut ad obedientiam aut ad poenam.]</hi> But this leaves
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48465:31"/>
out the premiant part, and ſome others: So that of <hi>Grotius</hi> doth, <hi>Eſt regula actionum moralium ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligans ad id quod rectum eſt.</hi> I acquieſce in the firſt, or rather in this, which is more full and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act; [A law is a ſign of the Rectors will conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting or confirming right or dueneſs.] That it be a ſign of the Rectors will <hi>de debito conſtituen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do vel confirmando,</hi> is the general nature of all laws. Some quarrel at the word [ſign] becauſe it is logical and not political: As if Politicians ſhould not ſpeak logically as well as other men! There is a twofold due: <hi>1.</hi> What is due from us to God (or any Rector;) and this is ſignified in the precept and prohibition, (or in the precept <hi>de agendo &amp; non agendo.) 2.</hi> What ſhall be due to us; and this is ſignified by promiſes, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miant part of the law, and by laws for diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and determination of proprieties. All bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are given us by God in a double relation, both as Rector and Benefactor: or as <hi>Benefactor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens;</hi> or as <hi>Rector benefaciens:</hi> though among men that ſtand not in ſuch a ſubordination to one another as we do to God, they may be received from a meer benefactor without any regent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt therein. The firſt laws do ever conſtitute the <hi>debitum</hi> or right: afterward there may be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laws and precepts to urge men to obey the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or to do the ſame thing: and the end of theſe is either fullier to acquaint the ſubject with the former, or to revive the memory of them, or to excite to the obedience of them: And theſe do not properly conſtitute duty, becauſe it was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before; but the nature and power of the act
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48465:32"/>
is the ſame with that which doth conſtitute it, and therefore doth confirm the conſtitution, and again oblige us to what we were obliged to before. For obligations to one and the ſame duty may be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied. <hi>3.</hi> Some take the word [law] in ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained a ſence as to exclude verbal or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar precepts, eſpecially directed but to one; or a few men; and will only call that a law which is written, or at leaſt a well known cuſtom obliging a whole ſociety in a ſtated way. Theſe be the moſt eminent ſort of laws: but to ſay that the reſt are no laws, is vain and groundleſs, againſt the true general definition of a Law, and juſtly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wiſeſt Politicians. That which we are now to enquire after, is a precept, or the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of a law, which is [a ſign of Gods will obliging us to duty,] of which ſigns there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially ſeveral ſorts, as <hi>1.</hi> by a voice, that's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of God: <hi>2.</hi> by writing: <hi>3.</hi> by viſible works or effects: <hi>4.</hi> by ſecret impreſſes, as by inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a law only to him that hath them.</p>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> HAving thus opened the terms [Law and Precept,] I prove the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus. <hi>1.</hi> If it was the duty of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to accept Gods offered mercy for their Children, to engage and devote them to him in Covenant, then there was a Law or Precept which made this their duty, and obliged them to it. But it was a duty: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was ſuch a Law or Precept. For the antecedent, <hi>1.</hi> If it were not a duty, then it was either a ſin, or a neutral indifferent action: But it was not a ſin, (for, <hi>1.</hi> It was againſt no Law, <hi>2.</hi> It is not reprehended;) nor was it indifferent, for it was of a moral nature, and <hi>ergo,</hi> either good or evil, yea ſin or duty: For properly <hi>permittere</hi> is no act of Law, (though many ſay it is,) but a ſuſpenſion of an act: and ſo <hi>licitum</hi> is not <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter bonum,</hi> but only <hi>non malum;</hi> and <hi>ergo</hi> is not properly within the verge of morality. <hi>2.</hi> If there be a penalty (and a moſt terrible penalty) annexed for the non-performance, then it was a duty: But ſuch a penalty was annexed (as ſhall anon be particularly ſhewed) even to be cut off from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48465:33"/>
his people, to be put to death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it oblige <hi>ad poenam,</hi> it did firſt oblige <hi>ad obedientiam:</hi> For no Law obligeth <hi>ad poenam,</hi> but for diſobedience, which preſuppoſeth an obligation to obedience. <hi>3.</hi> If it were not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> duty to enter their Children into Gods Covenant and Church, then it would have been none of their ſin to have omitted or refuſed ſo to do: But it would have been their great and hainous ſin to have omitted or refuſed it; <hi>Ergo.</hi> Now to the conſequence of the <hi>major.</hi> There is no duty but what is made by ſome Law or Precept as its proper efficient cauſe or foundation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> if it be a duty, there was certainly ſome Law or Precept that made it ſuch. Among men we ſay, that a benefit obligeth to gratitude, though there were no Law: But the meaning is, if there were no humane law, and that is becauſe the Law of God in nature requireth man to be juſt and thankful. If there were no law of God natural or poſitive that did conſtitute it or oblige us to it, there could be no duty. <hi>1.</hi> There is no duty but what is made ſuch by Gods ſignified will, <hi>ergo,</hi> no duty but what is made ſuch by a Law or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. For a Precept is the ſign of Gods will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to duty. <hi>2.</hi> Where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom. 4.15. ergo,</hi> where there is no law there is no duty; for theſe are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: it is a duty not to tranſgreſs the Law, and a tranſgreſſion not to perform the duty which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us. There is no apparent ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but in caſe of Covenants. Whether a man may not oblige himſelf to a duty meerly by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? I anſwer, <hi>1.</hi> He may oblige himſelf to an
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48465:34"/>
act, which he muſt perform, or elſe prove unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſhoneſt: but his own obligation makes it not ſtrictly a duty: <hi>ergo,</hi> when God makes a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with man, he is as it were obliged in point of fidelity, but not of duty. <hi>2.</hi> He that obligeth himſelf to an act by promiſe, doth occaſion an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to duty from God, becauſe God hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men to keep their promiſes. <hi>3.</hi> So far as a man may be ſaid to be his own Ruler, ſo far may he be ſaid to oblige himſelf to duty, (that is duty to himſelf, though the act be for the benefit of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;) but then he may as fitly be ſaid to make a Law to himſelf, or command himſelf: ſo that ſtill the duty (ſuch as it is) hath an anſwerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. So that I may well conclude, that there is a law, becauſe there is a duty. For nothing but a Law could cauſe that duty, nor make that omiſſion of it a ſin. Where there is no law, ſin is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, <hi>Rom. 5.13.</hi> But the omiſſion of entring Infants into Covenant with God before Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation would have been a ſin imputed; <hi>ergo,</hi> there was a law commanding it. <hi>2.</hi> If it was a duty to dedicate Infants to God, or enter them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with him, then either by Gods will, or without it: certainly not without it. If by Gods will, then either by his will revealed, or unreveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His unrevealed will cannot oblige; for there wants promulgation, which is neceſſary to obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And no man can be bound to know Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed will, unleſs remotely, as it may be long of himſelf that it is not to him revealed. If it be Gods revealed will that muſt thus oblige, then there was ſome ſign by which it was revealed. And
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48465:34"/>
if there were a ſign revealing Gods will obliging us to duty, then there was a law, for this is the very nature of the preceptive part of a law, (which is the principal part,) ſo that you may as well ſay, that you are a reaſonable creature, but not a man, as ſay that men were obliged to duty by Gods revealed will, but yet not by a Law or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. <hi>3.</hi> We ſhall anon produce the Law or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and put it out of doubt that there was ſuch a thing. In the mean time I muſt confeſs, I do not remember that ever I was put to diſpute a point that carrieth more of its own evidence to ſhame the gain-ſayer. And if you can gather Diſciples even among the godly, by perſwading them that there were duties without Precepts or Laws, and benefits without donations, covenants or promiſe confirming them, then deſpair of nothing for the time to come: You may perſwade them that there is a Son without a Father, or any relation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its foundation, or effect without its cauſe, and never doubt but the ſame men will believe you, while you have the ſame intereſt in them, and uſe the ſame artifice in putting off your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>

Your words are ſo ambiguous in this, that they ſignifie nothing of your mind to any that knows it not ſome other way. For when you ſay <hi>[there is no ſuch particular promiſe concerning Infants viſible
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48465:35"/>
Church-memberſhip, or precept,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>beſides Circumciſion, as in my Book of Baptiſm I aſſert,]</hi> who knows whether that exception of <hi>[Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion]</hi> be a conceſſion of ſuch a precept or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the caſe of Circumciſion? or if not, what ſenſe it hath? and what you imagine that precept or promiſe to be which I aſſert? and before the ſenſe of your one ſyllable [ſuch] is diſcerned by trying it by a whole volume, I doubt you will make what you liſt of it. However if you ſhould mean, that ſuch precepts there are as have for their ſubject [the avouching God to be their God, the entring into Covenant Circumciſion] of Infants, but not their Church-memberſhip; then, <hi>1.</hi> I have proved the contrary to the negative before; <hi>2.</hi> And more ſhall do anon; <hi>3.</hi> And it's a palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the precedent affirmative. But if you mean that Church-memberſhip of Infants as well as others is the ſubject or part of the ſubject of thoſe promiſes or precepts, and yet that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were not made or confirmed thereby; it is the contrary that I am aſſerting, and I have no further need to prove, than by ſhewing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of your opinion to it ſelf. For an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Covenant or promiſe that doth not give right to the benefit promiſed (according to its tenor and terms,) is like a cauſe that hath no effect, a Father that did never generate, and it is all one as to ſay, a gift or Covenant which is no gift or Covenant, ſeeing the name is denied, when the thing named and defined is granted. So a Precept or Law to enter Infants ſolemnly into Church-memberſhip, which yet obligeth none ſo to

enter them, is as groſs a contradiction as to ſay, the Sun hath not heat or light, and yet is truly a Sun.</p>

                           <hi>R. B. I</hi> Come next to the ſixth Queſtion, Whether indeed there be any tranſeunt fact, which without the cauſation of any promiſe or precept, did make the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Infants Church-members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This you affirm (if you would be underſtood;) whether this your ground of Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip or mine be righter, I hope will be no hard matter for another man (of common capacity) to diſcern. By a [tranſeunt fact] thus ſet as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct to a law, precept or promiſe, either you mean the act of legiſlation and promiſe making, or ſome other meerly phyſical act. If the former, it is too ridiculous to be uſed in a ſerious buſineſs: For you ſhould not put things in competition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the one, where they both muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48465:36"/>
concur, the one ſtanding in a ſubordination to the other. Was there ever a Law or Covenant made in the world any other way than by a tranſeunt fact? Sure all legiſlation is by ſome ſignification of the Soveraigns will. And the making of that ſign is a tranſeunt fact. If it be by voice, is not that tranſeunt? If by writing, is not the act tranſeunt? If by creation it ſelf, the act is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeunt though the effect be permanent. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if legiſlation or promiſing be your tranſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt fact, you do very abſurdly put it in oppoſition to a law (or promiſe) it being the making of ſuch a law. And the legiſlation doth no way oblige the ſubject, but by the law ſo made: nor doth the making of a promiſe, grant or covenant, confer right to the benefit which is the ſubject of it, any otherwiſe than as it is the making of that grant which ſhall ſo confer it. As the making of a knife doth not cut, but the knife made: and ſo of other inſtruments. So that if the law oblige not, or the grant confer not, certainly the legiſlation or promiſe-making cannot do it. I cannot therefore imagine that this is your ſenſe, without charging you with too great abſurdity. As if you ſhould ſay, It is not the will of the teſtator, <hi>i. e.</hi> his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that entitleth the legatary to the legacy, but it is the tranſeunt fact of the teſtator in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that will: or it is not the Soveraigns commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that authorizeth a Judge, ſouldier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is the tranſeunt fact of writing or making that commiſſion. It is not the ſign that ſignifieth, but the tranſeunt fact of making that ſign. Were not this a contemptible arguing? To charge you with

this, were to make you <hi>tantum non</hi> unreaſonable. And yet I know not what to ſay to you, that is, how to underſtand you. For if you mean a meer phyſical tranſeunt fact, which is no ſuch legiſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or promiſe-making, then it is far more abſurd than the former. For if it be not a ſign of Gods will obliging to duty, or conferring benefit, then can it not ſo oblige to duty, nor confer benefits. It is no other tranſeunt fact but legiſlation that can oblige a ſubject to duty, nor any other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeunt fact but promiſe, or other donation, that can convey right to a benefit, or oblige the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. A moral or civil effect muſt be produced by a moral or civil action, and not by a meer phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical action; which is unfit to produce ſuch an ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en effect, and can go no higher than its own kind. What ſenſe therefore I ſhould put on your words, without making them appear unreaſonable, even much below the rates of ordinary rational peoples diſcourſe, I cannot tell. For to ſay, it is not a law but legiſlation, is all one as to ſay, it is not the <hi>fundamentum,</hi> but the laying of that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that cauſeth the relation, or from which it doth reſult. And to ſay it is an alien phyſical act, which hath no ſuch thing as right for its ſubject or <hi>terminus,</hi> is to confound phyſicks and morals, and to ſpeak the groſſeſt abſurdities; as to ſay that the tranſeunt fact of eating, drinking, going, building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do adopt ſuch an one to be your heir. I muſt needs think therefore, till you have better cleared your ſelf, that you have here quit your ſelf as ill, and forſaken and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up your Cauſe, as palpably as ever I knew man

do, without an expreſs confeſſion that it is naught. When men muſt be taught by this obtuſe ſubtilty to prove that Infants Church-memberſhip needed no revocation, forſooth [becauſe their Church-memberſhip was not cauſed by a law, precept, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or covenant, but by a tranſeunt fact] than which as you leave it, the world hath ſcarce heard a more incoherent dream. But I pray you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in your reply that you being the affirmer of this, muſt prove it. Which I ſhall expect, when you can prove that you can generate a man by ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or blowing your noſe, or by plowing and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can produce Kings and Emperors.</p>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> IN conſideration of the ſeventh Queſtion, I ſhall conſider the nature and effect of the tranſeunt fact which you here deſcribe. And firſt of the reaſon of that name. You ſay that you call it [tranſeunt] [becauſe done in time and ſo not eternal, and paſt and ſo not in congruous ſenſe repealeable as a law, ordinance, ſtatute, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree which determines ſuch a thing ſhall be for the future.] And do you think this the common ſenſe of the word? or a fit reaſon of your appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to the thing in hand?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48465:38"/>I think your intellection and volition are imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts, and yet not eternal.</p>
                        <p>We uſe to contradiſtinguiſh tranſeunt acts from immanent, and that becauſe they do <hi>tranſire in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum extraneum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it ſeems you take them here as diſtinct from permanent.</p>
                        <p>But uſe your ſenſe as long as we underſtand it.</p>
                        <p>If it be only [paſt] actions which you call [tranſeunt] it ſeems your long fact which was ſo many hundred years in doing, was no tranſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt fact till the end of all thoſe years; and ſo did not (by your own doctrine) make any Church-members till the end of thoſe years.</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, the Queſtion is not, whether it were a tranſeunt fact that laid the foundation by legiſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or promiſe-making; but whether the effect were tranſeunt, or the act as it is <hi>in patiente:</hi> Whether the law were tranſeunt which was made by a tranſeunt fact? and whether the moral action of that law were permanent or tranſeunt? it being moſt certainly ſuch a moral act that muſt produce a title, or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a duty. Gods writing the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſtone was a fact ſoon paſt, but the law was not ſoon paſt, nor the moral act of that law, <hi>viz.</hi> obligation. There are verbal laws, that have no real permanent ſign: and yet the law may be permanent, and the obligation permanent, becauſe the ſign may have a permanency <hi>in eſſe cognito,</hi> and ſo the ſignifying vertue may remain by the help of memory, though the word did vaniſh in the ſpeaking.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48465:38"/>When you come to point out this tranſeunt fact individually, you ſay [it is Gods taking the whole people of the Jews for his people,] which you term [fact] as conceiving it moſt comprehenſive of the many particular acts in many generations whereby he did accompliſh it.] <hi>1.</hi> I did not well underſtand before that [a fact] did ſo vaſtly differ from an [Act,] as to contain the acts (rather than the facts) of many generations.</p>
                        <p>This is a long fact according to your meaſure, even from <hi>Abrahams</hi> call out of <hi>Ur:</hi> but how long it ſeems you are not well agreed with your ſelf. For in the firſt part of your Letter you enumerate to the other acts that compoſe this fact [the bringing them into the bond of the Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> giving them laws, ſetling their Prieſthood, Tabernacle, Army, Government, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance:] But before you end, you change your mind, and ſay [the Church-memberſhip of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> began as I conceive with <hi>Abrahams</hi> call, and was compleated when they were brought out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to God, <hi>Exod. 19.4.</hi>] But ſure that was long before the ſetling their inheritance. Your fact according to your laſt account was about <hi>437.</hi> years in doing; but according to your firſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was about <hi>470.</hi> years long.</p>
                        <p>If it were one individual fact of about <hi>470.</hi> years long that made Infants Church-members, then they could not be Church-members till that fact was paſt, For the effect is not before the cauſe, or cauſality of the efficient; the relation cannot be before the <hi>fundamentum</hi> be laid: and it ſeems this long fact was the laying of the <hi>fundamentum:</hi>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48465:39"/>
But the conſequent is certainly falſe; for Infants were Church-members before the end or compleating of your long fact: For they were Church-members (you'l grant) when <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was not this long fact that made them Church-members.</p>
                        <p>If you mean that it was not the whole, but ſome part of this long fact that actually made Infants Church-members, then you would have aſſigned that part, when that was the thing deſired, and which you pretended exactly to perform; or at leaſt you would not have told us it comprehended all theſe acts.</p>
                        <p>And if each particular act did make Infants Church-members, or lay a ſufficient ground of it, then it ſeems that it was done before the inſtitution of Circumciſion. For Gods calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Ur</hi> was before it. So that the Children born in his houſe muſt be Church-members upon that; and a ſufficient ground laid for his own to have been ſuch, if he had then had a natural iſſue: And it ſeems then that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was born a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber many years before Circumciſion.</p>
                        <p>If this be your meaning, I pray you be ſo juſt and impartial as to accept of the proof which I ſhall give you of Infants Church-memberſhip before <hi>Abrahams</hi> days, if I make it appear to be as ſtrong as this call of <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>Ur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you ſhould mean that ſome one of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended acts ſhould of it ſelf make any Infants Church-members, then it muſt be any one; for you no more aſſign it to one of them than to another, (only ſay [chiefly the bringing them from <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi>]
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48465:39"/>
But ſurely ſome of theſe acts particularly cannot do it, as the leading to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval to <hi>Canaan,</hi> to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> placing, preſerving there, ſetling their Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did any one of theſe make Infants to become Church-members?</p>
                        <p>Nay, ſuppoſe you mean that all theſe acts muſt concur to make them members, (and ſo that they were no members till many hundred years after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Circumciſion,) yet could not your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hold good: For ſome of theſe acts are of an alien nature, and no more apt to cauſe infant Church-memberſhip, than a Bull to generate a Bird. What aptitude hath the ſetling of an Army to be any part of the cauſation of Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip? None, I think; at leaſt if it be ſuch an Army as ours: For ſurely the ſetling of ours cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no ſuch thing, as you well know. What apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude hath the leading to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> or removal to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to make Infants Church-members? Nay, how ſtrange is it, that the removing of Church-members, and ſuch as had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Church-members, as <hi>Iſhmael, Keturahs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Eſau,</hi> muſt cauſe Infant Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Sure it was no cauſe of their own. <hi>Ketu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> children were Church-members in infancy: I enquire of you by what act they were made ſuch? You ſay [by Gods fact of taking the whole people of the Jews for his people] whereof the act of removing <hi>Keturahs</hi> children was a part. Very good. It ſeems then that removing from the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a people of the Jews, is a taking of the removed to be of that people: or elſe it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the taking that people, but alſo the removal
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48465:40"/>
from that people that maketh Church-members, even the removed as well as the taken, both which are alike abſurd.</p>
                        <p>And I pray you tell me yet a little better, how an act can make a man a Church-member that was one long before that was done? You cannot here ſay, that it was before <hi>in eſſe morali,</hi> and had a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſation. How then could your chiefeſt act, the bringing out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> make thoſe Infants Church-members that were born in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and were Church-members before? Or how could it be any part of the cauſe? Did the bringing out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> concur to make <hi>Moſes</hi> a Church-member when he was in the basket on the waters? And when you anſwer this, you may do well to go a little further, and tell me, how ſuch an act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth to make him an Infant Church-member that was dead an hundred or two hundred years before that act was done. For example, how did the ſetling of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Army, or Inheritance, or the Covenant on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> make <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or <hi>Eſau,</hi> or <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> Church-members?</p>
                        <p>I deſire you alſo to tell me by the next, what be the nerves and ligaments that tie all theſe acts of <hi>430.</hi> years at leaſt together, ſo as to make them one fact? And whether I may not as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly make a fact ſufficient for this purpoſe of the acts of an hundred or two hundred years only? And whether you may not as well make all the acts from <hi>Abrahams</hi> call till <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be one fact, and aſſign it to this office?</p>
                        <p>You ſay that you call this <hi>fact</hi> [tranſeunt] becauſe it's [paſt,] (and ſo till it's [paſt] it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48465:40"/>
ſeems <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> that were dead before, are no Chruch-members;] I would then fain know whether it be this ſame tranſeunt <hi>fact,</hi> or ſome other, that makes Infants Church-members five hundred years after it is paſt? If it be this ſame, then how comes a meer tranſeunt <hi>fact</hi> to work ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſo many hundred years after it is paſt? unleſs it made a Law or Covenant which doth the deed? If it be a new tranſeunt <hi>fact</hi> that muſt make Infants Church-members after the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this (the ſetling their inheritances;) then I pray you let me know, whether it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

If on the nation, remember to tell us what it was; and do not only tell us the cauſe of the member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of former Infants. And ſeeing it muſt be ſuch as the memberſhip of every Infant till Chriſts time at leaſt muſt be cauſed by, I pray you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to make your work ſquare and full, and be ſure to aſſign us no other kind of <hi>fact,</hi> than what you will prove to have been ſo frequently repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every age, and ſo fully extenſive to every Infant among the Jews, as that it have no gaps, but may make all members that were ſo in each age. And remember, that it is no law, precept, promiſe or covenant that you muſt aſſign for the cauſe; for that is it you are engaged againſt: but a conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of tranſeunt <hi>facts</hi> extending to each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual member. O what work have you made your ſelf? and what a ſort of new political Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhall we have from you, when theſe things are accompliſhed according to the frame you have

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t all this yet is but a light velitation: The principal thing that I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, is, what your great comprehenſive fact is in the true nature of it, which you call [Gods taking the whole people of the Jews to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.] Doth the word [taking] ſignifie a meer phyſical taking or fact; or a moral, ſuch as among men we call, a civil action? If it be a meer phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical taking, then, <hi>1.</hi> It cannot produce a moral effect, ſuch as that in queſtion is. <hi>2.</hi> And then it muſt have an anſwerable object, which muſt be individual exiſtent perſons. <hi>3.</hi> And then you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call it one fact, but many thouſand: even as many as there were perſons taken in to the Jews in above four hundred years. <hi>4.</hi> And then what was the phyſical act which is called Gods taking? was it ſuch a taking as the Angel uſed to <hi>Lot,</hi> that carried him out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> or as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48465:41"/>
Author mentions of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> that was taken by the hair of the head, and carried by the Angel into another Country, to bring <hi>Daniel</hi> a meſs of Pottage? If God muſt by a phyſical appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion take hold of them that he makes Church-members, we ſhall be at a loſs for our proof of their Church-memberſhip. But I cannot imagine that this is your ſenſe. But what is it then? Is it a phyſical action though a moral cauſation of ſome phyſical effect? That it cannot be: For it is a political or moral effect that we enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It neceſſarily remains therefore that this be a political moral taking that you here ſpeak of. And if ſo, then the tranſeunt fact you ſpeak of muſt needs be a civil or political action. And what that can be, which is no Law, Promiſe or Covenant in this caſe, I pray you beſtow ſome more diligence to inform us, and not put us off with the raw name of a tranſeunt fact oppoſed to theſe. Certainly, if it be a civil or legal action, the product or effect of it is <hi>jus</hi> or <hi>debitum,</hi> ſome due or right: And that is either, <hi>1.</hi> A dueneſs of ſomewhat from us, (which is either ſomewhat to be done, or ſomewhat to be given;) <hi>2.</hi> Or a dueneſs of ſomething to us, which is either of good or evil: If good, it is either by contract or dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (whether by a Teſtament praemiant Law, or the like:) if evil, it is either by ſome poenal Law, or voluntary agreement: Now which of theſe is it that your tranſeunt <hi>fact</hi> produceth? To be a member of the Church, is to be a member of a ſociety taking God in Chriſt to be their God, and taken by him for his ſpecial people. The <hi>act</hi>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48465:42"/>
which makes each member, is of the ſame nature with that which makes the ſociety. The relation then eſſentially containeth, <hi>1.</hi> A right to the great benefits of Gods ſoveraignty over men, Chriſts headſhip, and that favour, protection, proviſion and other bleſſings, which are due from ſuch a powerful and graciou Soveraign to ſuch Subjects, and from ſuch a Head to his Members: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a right to my ſtation in the Body, and to the inſeparable benefits thereof. <hi>2.</hi> It containeth my debt of obedience to God in Chriſt, acknowledged and promiſed actually or virtually, really or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively. Now for the firſt, how can God be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto me as my God, or Chriſt as my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and I to him as one that have ſuch right to him and his bleſſings, by any other way than his own free gift? This gift muſt be ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of his will: For his ſecret will is not a gift, but a purpoſe of giving. This way of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore is by a civil or moral action, which is a ſignifying of the Donors will; and can be by no way, but either pure donation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, teſtament, or law. In our caſe it muſt needs partake of the nature of all theſe. It is not from one in any equality, nor capable of any obliging compenſation or retribution from us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore from an abſolute diſ-engaged Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, it muſt needs be by pure donation, or it cannot be ours. Yet as he is pleaſed as it were to oblige himſelf by promiſe, or by his word, and alſo to call us to a voluntary acceptance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to certain fidelity, gratitude and duty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>nd ſo is the ſtipulator, and we the promiſers in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48465:42"/>
the latter part of the action: it is therefore juſtly called a contract or Covenant, though indeed the word [Covenant] frequently ſignifieth Gods own promiſe alone. As it proceedeth from the death of the teſtator (in natural moral-reputative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) ſo it is called a teſtament. And as it is an <hi>act</hi> of a ruling Benefactor, giving this benefit to the governed, to promote the ends of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and obliging to duty thereby, ſo it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh of the nature of a law. The commoneſt Scripture name for this <hi>act,</hi> is Gods Covenant or Promiſe, and ſometimes his gift; which all ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame thing here. It follows therefore, that either by Gods [taking <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple] you mean ſome civil political action, as a Covenant, Promiſe, or the like collation of the benefit, (and then you aſſert the thing which you deny,) or elſe you know not what you mean, nor can make another know it, without the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the groſſeſt abſurdity. And as for the other thing which is contained in Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, the profeſſed duty of man to God, it is moſt certain, <hi>1.</hi> That Gods Law obligeth us to that duty: <hi>2.</hi> And obligeth all according to their capacities to conſent to the obligation, and ſo to re-engage themſelves: <hi>3.</hi> That this actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent profeſſed doth therefore double the obligation. And thus by a mutual contract, Covenant or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (whereof our part is firſt required by a law,) is the relation of Church-memberſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Now to lay by and deny all this, and give us the general naked name of [taking for Gods people,] is meerly deluſory, ſeeing that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48465:43"/>
[taking] means this which you exclude, or it means nothing that is true and reaſonable. And therefore tell us better what it means.</p>
                        <p>As for the Texts you cite, <hi>Deut. 4.34.</hi> &amp; <hi>Levit. 20.24, 26. 1 King. 8.53. Iſai. 43.1.</hi> In <hi>Deut. 4.</hi> is mentioned not the moral act of God by which he made them his people, or took them for his own, and founded the relation: but the natural actions whereby he reſcued them from the Aegyptian bondage and took them to himſelf or for his uſe, ſervice, and honour out of that land. But I think ſure they were his people, and all their Infants were Church-members before that taking by vertue of a former Covenant-taking.</p>
                        <p>As to <hi>Levit. 20.</hi> God did perform a twofold work of ſeparation for <hi>Iſrael. 1.</hi> By his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and their entring Covenant with him. <hi>2.</hi> By local ſeparation of their bodies from others. It was the firſt that made them his people, and Church-members, and not the laſt: the laſt was only a favourable dealing with them as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. The ſame I ſay to the other two Texts. Sure you cannot think that corporal ſeparation makes a Church-member. What if an Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that had no part in the Covenant had paſt out with the <hi>Iſraelies,</hi> and got with them through the Red Sea, do you think he had been therefore a Church-member? Suppoſe God had made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> or his ſeed, but only taken them out of <hi>Chaldea</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and thence into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and thence into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and thence into <hi>Canaan</hi> again: Do you think this much had made them Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?

Then if the Turks conquer <hi>Greece,</hi> or the Tartarians conquer <hi>China,</hi> they are become Church-members, becauſe this ſeems as great a temporal proſperity at leaſt. And I think it is paſt doubt, that <hi>Lot</hi> was a Church-member in the midſt of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were brought out, as truly as after.</p>
                        <p>As to <hi>Gen. 12.1. Acts 7.2. Nehem. 9.7.</hi> which you alſo cite, as there is not one of them that gives the leaſt intimation that Infant-Church-memberſhip then began, ſo I ſhall further enquire anon, whether they contain any Covenant or promiſe.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Exod. 19.4, 5.</hi> hath no word that gives the leaſt intimation that God by that act of taking them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> did make <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Church, or the Infants or any others, members of it: But only that by fulfilling a former promiſe in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a people formerly his own, he layeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligations to duty on them by redoubling his mercies. The ſame I ſay of <hi>Levit. 11.45. Neh. 1.10.</hi> I will not believe yet, but that you believe your ſelf, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and their Infants were as truly Church-members before, as after their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And me-thinks the Texts you cite might put it out of doubt. What if God ſay, <hi>Hoſ. 11.1.</hi> [When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a child I loved him, and called my Son out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>] Is it eaſie hence to prove that calling him out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> did make him his Son that was none before: or to prove that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Gods Son before he called him out of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> If you ſhould maintain the former, I might expect that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48465:44"/>
you ſhould ſay the like of Chriſt himſelf, to whom the Evangeliſt applieth this text; and ſo you may prove as fairly, that Chriſt was none of Gods Son till he was called out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but was made his Son by that call. Certainly the Text termeth him Gods Son that was called, as being ſo before that call. By this time I am well content that any waking man do compare your doctrine and mine, and try whether it be a tranſeunt fact, or a Law and Covenant, that made Infants and all others Church-members: and if they do not admire that ever a learned man ſhould harbour ſuch a conceit as yours, and that ever a godly man ſhould build ſuch a weight on it, and go ſo far on ſuch a ground, yea and that ever ordinary godly people ſhould be ſo blinded with ſuch palpable nonſenſe or abſurdities, then let them ſtill follow you in the dark; for I expect not that reaſon ſhould recover them.</p>

                           <hi>R. B. I</hi> Come now to the eighth Queſtion, that is to ſpeak to the point which you propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You urge me to cite to you the particular Texts that contain this Law, Ordinance, Precept or Covenant. To which I anſwer thus. <hi>1.</hi> There are two ſorts of Laws; one which firſt make a duty; the other which ſuppoſe it ſo made, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48465:44"/>
do only call for obedience, and excite thereto, or preſcribe ſomewhat as a means in order thereunto. If I could ſhew you no written law or promiſe as firſt conſtituting the duty, or granting the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Church-memberſhip, it were not the leaſt diſparagement to my cauſe, as long as I can ſhew you thoſe following Laws which preſuppoſe this. You know the Church of God did live about <hi>2000.</hi> years without any written law that we know of: Where then was Gods will manifeſted about ſuch things as this, but in tradition and nature? If <hi>Moſes</hi> then at the end of this <hi>2000.</hi> years did find this tradition, and find all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Church-members in poſſeſſion of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, then what need he make a new Law about it? Or why ſhould God promiſe it as a new thing? I confeſs if I ſhould find by any new law or promiſe that it did begin but in <hi>Moſes</hi> days, I ſhould think it ſome abatement of the ſtrength of my cauſe (though yet I think there would enough remain.) <hi>2.</hi> There are (yet higher) two ſorts of laws: the one for the conſtitution of the Common-wealth it ſelf, the other for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration or government of it when it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. The former are called by ſome, Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, as laying the frame and form of the Common-wealth, and the quality of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think indeed, that as conſtitutive of the form of the Common-wealth, theſe are ſcarce properly called Laws; though as they look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, obliging to duty, and prohibiting alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they may. But if they be not laws, they are ſomewhat higher, and lay the ground of all laws
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48465:45"/>
and obedience, and ſo are laws <hi>eminenter &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiter,</hi> though not actually and formally: And in our caſe, as this conſtitution did ſubject us to God, making it our duty ever after to obey him; ſo doth it oblige us to acknowledge that ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the very conſtitution of the Church is an act of high beneficence, and performed by the fundamental grant or Covenant. Now if this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and conſtitution could not expreſly be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in writing, it were no diminution of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it, ſeeing among men Fundamentals are ſeldom written; and when they are, it is only as Laws obliging the ſubject to maintain and adhere to the firſt conſtitution. As long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we can prove that it is Gods will that ſucceſſively Infants ſhould be Church-members, it no whit invalidates the cauſe if we could not ſhew the original conſtitution in writing. Yet ſomewhat we ſhall attempt. <hi>3.</hi> We have full proof of Infants Church-memberſhip by Laws and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants concerning it, ever ſince the time that there was a written word of God: and that is ſufficient, if we could fetch it no higher. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving premiſed this, I come nearer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                        <p>The firſt inſtitution of Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip <hi>de jure</hi> upon ſuppoſition of their exiſtence, was in Gods firſt conſtitution of the Republick of the world, when he became mans Governour, and determined of his ſubjects, and members of the Common-wealth: Which Republick being ſacred, and devoted to Gods worſhip and ſervice, was truly a Church of which God was head. This
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48465:45"/>
was performed by the firſt Law and Covenant made either in or upon mans creation. That ſuch a Covenant or promiſe of felicity was made by God to innocent man, almoſt all Divines agree: But becauſe it is rather implied than expreſſed in <hi>Moſes</hi> brief Hiſtory, ſome few cavillers do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contradict us. But, <hi>1.</hi> The threatning of death for ſin, ſeems to imply a promiſe of life if he ſinned not. <hi>2.</hi> And the New Teſtament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth us divers paſſages that yet plainlier prove it, which to you I need not recite. But whether this promiſe of life were natural (as the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of death was,) or only poſitive and more arbitrary, Divines are not agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thoſe that ſay it was free and poſitive, give this reaſon, That God could not naturally be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to bleſs or felicitate the moſt innocent or perfect creature, nor any creature merit of God. Thoſe that think it natural as the threatning was, ſay, it's true that God could not be properly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, becauſe he is under no Law, no more is he obliged to puniſh, but only man obliged to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer if he inflict it: And it's true that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtrictly merit of God. But yet, ſay they, as man may have a natural aptitude for ſuch feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſo God hath a natural propenſity to do good according to the capacity of the ſubject, and his works do oblige him (improperly) in point of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and immutability as well as his word. So that their reaſons are theſe following. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe God is as naturally prone to do good to the good, as to do evil to the evil, that is, to reward as to puniſhment, as his name proclaimed to <hi>Moſes,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48465:46"/>
Exod. 34.</hi> ſhews. <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe God making man capable of a higher felicity, and principling him with inclinations thereto, and giving him deſires, love, and other affections for that bleſſed end, even the everlaſting fruition of God, therefore they ſay, God did in this frame of his nature give him ground to expect ſuch a felicity; if he ſinned not. For elſe all theſe inclinations and affection ſhould have been in vain: But God made not ſo noble a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with vain inclinations and affections to act fallaciouſly and falſly. Alſo Gods works would not be harmonical: So that as Gods promiſe is but a ſign of his will obliging him improperly in point of fidelity and immutability, ſo, ſay they, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man was a ſign of Gods will ſo far enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him: So that as he could not let-ſin go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed without ſome breach in the harmony of his ſapiential frame of adminiſtration, no more could he deny to perfect man the object of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which he formed in him. So that although he might have made man ſuch a creature as ſhould not neceſſarily be puniſhed for evil, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for good, that is, he might have made him not a man; yet having ſo made him, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he be governed as a man in regard of felicity as well as penalty. <hi>3.</hi> Our Philoſophers and Divines do commonly prove the immortality of the ſoul from its natural inclinations to God and eternal felicity. And if the immortality may be ſo proved from its nature, then alſo its felicity in caſe of righteouſneſs. I interpoſe not my ſelf as a Judge in this controverſie of Divines, but I have mentioned it to the end which I ſhall now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48465:46"/>
                           <hi>1.</hi> It is moſt certain, whether the reward or promiſe be natural or poſitive, that ſuch a ſtate of felicity man was either in or in the way to, or in part and the way to more. And it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that man was made holy, devoted to God, and fit for his ſervice, and that in this eſtate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of his creation, he was to increaſe and multiply: It is moſt certain therefore, that according to the firſt law of nature, Infants ſhould have been Church-members. <hi>2.</hi> But if their opinion hold, that make the reward grounded on the law of nature, and not on a meer poſitive law, (and you ſee the reaſons are not contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,) then the argument would be yet more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious. <hi>3.</hi> But however it be of the title to glory or eternity, it is moſt certain, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the very law of nature Infants were to have been Church-members if man had ſtood. The firſt Text therefore that I cite for Infants Church-memberſhip, as expreſſing its original <hi>de jure,</hi> is <hi>Gen. 1.26, 27, 28. [So God created man in his own Image — And God bleſſed them, and God ſaid unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and repleniſh the earth.]</hi> Here you ſee by the law of nature Infants were to have been born in Gods Image and in innocency, and ſo Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

                        <p>R. B. <hi>THe next Inſtitution of Infants Church-memberſhip, was at the firſt proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace to fallen man, or in the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of redemption to ſinners, in Gen.</hi> 3.15. [And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.] <hi>I will prove that this fundamental Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace or promiſe doth declare it to be the will of God that Infants ſhould be Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: And to this end, let us firſt conſider what the words expreſly contain, and then what light may be fetcht from other Texts to illuſtrate them. It being a known rule, that an Expoſitor muſt not turn univerſals into ſingulars or particulars, nor reſtrain and limit the Scripture generals, where the word it ſelf or the nature of the ſubject doth not limit them, I may well conclude that theſe things following are comprehended in this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental promiſe.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Devil having plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemy to mankind, and brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſin and miſery, God would not leave them remedileſs, nor to that total voluntary ſubjection to him as he might ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e done: But in grace or undeſerved mercy would engage them in a war againſt him, in which they that conquered ſhould bruiſe his head.</hi> 2. <hi>That in this war the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the principal ſeed, is promiſed to be our General, whoſe perfect nature ſhould contain,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48465:49"/>
and his perfect life expreſs a perfect enmity againſt Satan, and who ſhould make a perfect conqueſt over him.</hi> 3. <hi>The Lord Jeſus is promiſed to do this work as the womans ſeed, and ſo as conceived of her, and born by her, and ſo as an Infant firſt, before he comes to ripeneſs of age. So that here an Infant of the woman is promiſed to be the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of this Army, and Head of the Church. This is moſt evident: By which God doth ſanctifie the humane birth, and the Infant ſtate, and aſſure us that he doth not exclude now that age from the redeemed Church, which he admitted into the Church by the laws of creation. For the firſt promiſe is of an Infant born of the woman to be the Head of the Church, and growing up to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to do the works of a Head. Had God excluded the Infant ſtate from the viſible Church he would not have made the Head firſt an Infant. Where note,</hi> 1. <hi>That Chriſt is the great exemplar of his Church; and in things which he was capable of, he did that firſt in his own body, which he would after do in theirs.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Head is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, even the principal Member, one of the two parts which conſtitute the whole. As the</hi> pars im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perans <hi>and</hi> pars ſubdita <hi>do conſtitute each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. So that if an Infant muſt be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber eminently ſo called, then Infants are not excluded from memberſhip, but are hereby clearly warranted to be members of a lower na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If an Infant may be Soveraign, no doubt he may be a Subject. If an Infant may be the chief Prophet of the Church, then no doubt but Infants may be Diſciples. If you ſtill harp on the old
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48465:49"/>
ſtring, and ſay, They are no Diſciples that learn not; you may as well ſay, He is no Prophet that teacheth not. And if you will openly deny Chriſt in Infancy to have been the Prophet of the Church, I will undertake to prove the falſhood and vileneſs of that opinion, as ſoon as I know you own it.

This is plain both in the Text, and in the experience of the fulfilling of it. As in the inſtrumental ſerpent, it is the whole ſerpentine nature, that hath an enmity to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and the whole humane nature to the ſerpentine nature; they being venemous to us, and we abhorring them as venemous, and as ſuch as our lives are in danger of: ſo is it the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature that is at enmity to the Diabolical nature. <hi>Vide Muſcul.

If they know any temptation to be from him, ſo far they diſlike it and abhor it, though for the thing preſented they may che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it. This is not ſpecial ſaving grace, but this is a great advantage to the work of ſpecial grace, and to our more effectual reſiſting of temptations, and entertaining the help that is offered us againſt them, when our very natures have an enmity to the diabolical nature: we now look on him as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

As he is Lord of all ſo the firſt is done on the natures of all: As he is Rector of all, but not by the ſame Laws (as to poſitives) ſo he obligeth all to this hoſtility, but not all as he doth thoſe that hear the Goſpel: As he is Benefactor he doth with his own as he liſt, and makes a difference. If any ſay that it is the ſame enmity that is here ſaid to be put in all, and therefore the ſame perſons in which it is put. I anſwer, <hi>1.</hi> There is no proof of either. A general command or promiſe to a community, may ſignifie a difference of duties or gifts to that community, though that difference be not expreſſed: For the nature of the ſubject may

prove it. And, <hi>2.</hi> Experience of the fulfilling of this promiſe or covenant, proves the difference before mentioned. And it is well known, <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſo conciſe in the Hiſtory of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>2.</hi> And that the myſterie of grace was to be opened by degrees, and ſo but darkly at the firſt, that it is no wonder if we find the whole ſumm of the Goſpel here coucht up in ſo narrow a room, and if each particular be not largely laid open before our eyes. <hi>7.</hi> That we may certainly know that this promiſe ſpeaks not only of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that Chriſt himſelf ſhould have to Satan, and doth not engage a General without an army, God doth here expreſly mention the woman her ſelf, ſaying <hi>[I will put enmity between thee and the woman]</hi> ſo that as ſhe ſtood in a threefold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; ſhe is here her ſelf poſſeſſed with this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold enmity. <hi>1.</hi> As ſhe is the root of humane nature, from whence all mankind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                           </gap> diabolical nature, and this to be naturally conveyed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated. <hi>2.</hi> As ſhe was the root of the great Republick of the world, or that rational ſociety which God as Rector would ſapientially govern, and her ſelf with her husband (who no doubt was alſo included in the promiſe) were the whole then exiſtent race of mankind, ſo did ſhe receive a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal enmity of obligation, which ſhe was traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to deliver down to all her poſterity, being her ſelf hereby obliged to liſt her ſelf and all her Infant progeny in the Redeemers army, againſt the proclaimed enemy, and to teach her poſterity to do the like: For thus obligatory precepts muſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48465:55"/>
be brought down. <hi>3.</hi> As ſhe was one of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen favourites of God, ſhe received the habitual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſanctification: And this is not in her power to propagate, though ſhe may uſe ſome means that are appointed thereto, and whether a promiſe of any ſuch thing be made to her ſeed on the uſe of ſuch means, I will not now ſtand to diſcuſs. <hi>8.</hi> It is not all that are poſſeſſed with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enmity againſt the Devil himſelf that are the Church of Chriſt: For this is but a common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative which is in all: Nor is it all that are obliged to the further enmity againſt the works of Satan: But all that on that obligation are duely liſted in Chriſts army againſt Satan (by the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged perſon) are viſible members: and all that are by ſanctification at an hearty enmity (habitual or actual) with the Kingdom of Satan, are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church called myſtical or inviſible. This I put as granted. <hi>9.</hi> Thoſe that violate this fundamental obligation, and to their natural pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſhall add a fighting againſt Chriſt and his Kingdom for Satan and his Kingdom, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come themſelves the ſeed of the Serpent. And though they had the natural enmity with the reſt of mankind in general againſt Satan, yet have they therewithal the habitual enmity againſt Chriſt. This much I ſuppoſe as out of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But whether alſo the firſt original corrupted nature it ſelf (before any ſin againſt recovering grace) did contain an habitual enmity againſt the Kingdom of the Redeemer? Or whether the ſins of later Parents may propagate this as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional corruption in our nature, I will not now
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48465:56"/>
ſtand to diſcuſs. Only as to our preſent buſineſs, it is certain that the general natural enmity to Satan, may conſiſt with an habitual friendſhip to his ways and cauſe. And though as men they may have the firſt common advantage of nature, and as ſubjects <hi>de jure</hi> may be under the common obligation, yea, and as liſted in Chriſts army may have many of its priviledges; yet for the enmity of diſpoſition to Chriſt, they may be under a greater curſe. <hi>10.</hi> As it is certain, that it is not only Chriſt himſelf that is here made the object of this promiſe, and is here called <hi>[the ſeed of the woman,]</hi> (as is before proved, and may be more, and is commonly granted;) ſo it is to be noted, that thoſe others in whom this enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is put, are called here <hi>[the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,]</hi> and not the ſeed of Chriſt (though the chief of them are his ſeed.) And ſo though the promiſe is made to none but the womans ſeed, and no exception put in againſt Infants, or any age of all her ſeed: Till you can prove that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are none of her ſeed, we muſt take this fundamental promiſe to extend to Infants, and that very plainly, without uſing any violence with the Text.</p>

                           <hi>11.</hi> Some learned men do uſe no contemptible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove further, That the ſanctifying en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is here promiſed to the ſeed of the woman as her ſeed (I mean thoſe that go the way of Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> &amp;c.) that is, that as the two former ſorts of enmity are put into all the ſeed of the woman (as is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſo the ſpiritual holy enmity promiſed to her

                        <p>R.B. I <hi>Come next to prove from other parts of Scripture, That the fundamental pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace is thus to be interpreted as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Infants.</hi> 1. <hi>If the ſame Covenant of grace when it is more fully and clearly opened, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly comprehend Infants as to be Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, then is this fundamental promiſe ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood (or then doth this alſo comprehend them.) But the antecedent is certain, therefore ſo is the conſequent. The antecedent I prove from the Covenant of grace made to</hi> Abraham <hi>the Father of the faithful, which comprehended Infants for Church-members: The Covenant made with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>comprehending Infants, was the ſame with this in</hi> Gen. 3. <hi>but in ſome things clearlier open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which is proved thus: Both theſe were the Covenant of grace and free juſtification by faith
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48465:57"/>
in the Redeemer, therefore they were the ſame. For there is but one ſuch. If</hi> Abraham <hi>had ſome ſpecial promiſes additional to the main Covenant, that makes not the Covenant of free juſtification by faith to be divers. That this in</hi> Gen. 3. <hi>is the promiſe or Covenant of grace and free juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not denied, that I know of. That the promiſe to</hi> Abraham <hi>was the ſame, is evident from</hi> Rom. 4.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. 1. <hi>It is there expreſly manifeſt, that the Covenant whereof Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was to</hi> Abraham <hi>the ſeal, was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of free juſtification by faith; Circumciſion it ſelf being a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith which</hi> Abraham <hi>had, yet being uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of believers,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Yea the promiſe that he ſhould be heir of the world was not made to</hi> Abraham <hi>or to his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith. Now it is certain that this Covenant ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Circumciſion and made to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed, did comprehend Infants. The conſequence of the</hi> major <hi>then is evident, that the ſame promiſe expreſſed more conciſely, is to be expounded by the ſame expreſſed more fully: And it is acknowledged that the Goſpel light and grace was to be manifeſt by certain degrees.</hi>

                           <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48465:59"/>And, Reader, if God have given no condition or character antecedent, as a <hi>differencing reaſon or qualification of thoſe that he will ſave</hi> from thoſe that he will not, but only told us that he will ſave whom he liſt, this maketh Infants no <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of his Kingdom, under no Law, and ſo lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to no judgement, nor to ſtand in judgement with the reſt of the world, but only to be uſed as beaſts or ſtones, by Divine natural motion as he will. And then, how can you ſay that any Infants ſhall be damned, or not ſaved? Or that it ſhall be one of a million at leaſt that ſhall not? For if there be no Law that giveth Right to Pardon and Salvation to any one Infant in the world, and yet many are ſaved, it will follow, 1. That God is (as the prophane ſay) better than his word, and will ſave many to whom he never gave right to it by promiſe. 2. And will not the ungodly put in for the like hopes?

And the firſt is moſt evidently contained in the Law of nature it ſelf (at leaſt upon ſuppoſition that there be any hopes of Gods entertaining them;) which I prove thus. <hi>1.</hi> The law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bindeth us to give to every one his own due: But Infants are Gods own due; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the law of Nature bindeth Parents to give them up to God. By [giving] here I mean not an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of propriety, to make that to be Gods that was not ſo before; but an acknowledgement of his right, with a free reſignation and dedication of the Infant to God, as his own; for his uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when he is capable thereof. If you ſay, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being not capable of doing ſervice, ſhould not be devoted to it till they can do it; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they are capable at preſent of a legal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to future duty, and alſo of the relation which followeth that obligation, together with the honour of a Church-member (as the child of a Noble
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48465:61"/>
man is of his Honours and title to his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) and many other mercies of the Covenant. And though Chriſt according to his humanity was not capable of doing the works of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator or head of the Church in his Infancy, yet for all that he muſt be head of the Church then, and not (according to this arguing) ſtay till he were capable of doing thoſe works. And ſo is it with his members.</p>
                        <p>Reply. <hi>Here is ſo little ſaid that needs but this remarke, that Mr.</hi> T. <hi>knoweth not how to deny the duty of</hi> dedication <hi>handſomly, which being Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God is to Church-memberſhip as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Marriage to publick, where publication is wanting: But he denieth that Parents may dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them by</hi> Baptiſm: <hi>But if they may and muſt do it</hi> privately <hi>by</hi> heart conſent, <hi>it will follow that they muſt do it publickly in the inſtituted way. As</hi> for my bold attempt <hi>in proving ſo much by the Law of Nature, if he cannot confute it, let him not ſtrive and ſin againſt nature.</hi>

B. 2. <hi>THe law of nature bindeth all Parents to do their beſt to ſecure Gods right, and their Childrens good, and to prevent their ſin and miſery: But to engage them betimes to God by ſuch a dedication, doth tend to ſecure Gods right, and their Childrens good, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſin and miſery: For they are under a double obligation, which they may be minded of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,

                        <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Really Infant Baptiſm is a diſadvantage, 1. In that it is the occaſion whereby they take themſelves to be Chriſtians afore they know what Chriſtianity is, and ſo are kept in preſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. They are kept from the true baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> This nearly concerneth our cauſe: I once inclined to theſe thoughts my ſelf: But I am ſatisfied, 1. That Infant Covenanting and Baptiſm is no hindrance in <hi>Nature</hi> or Reaſon from <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſerious Covenanting</hi> with God at age. We tell our Children and all the adult, that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Covenanting by Parents, will ſerve them but till they have <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> to chooſe for themſelves: And that without as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a faith and conſent of their own then as if they had never been baptized, they cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: What hurt then as to this doth their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant intereſt do them?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Yea doubtleſs it is a great help: For, 1. To be in the way of Gods Ordinance and Benediction is much. 2. And (knowing you deny that) I add, to be conſcious of an early engagement, may do much to awe the minds of Children; yea and to cauſe them to love that Chriſt which hath received them, and that Society to which they belong.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If Children till Baptized have any thoughts of dying, according to you, they muſt have little hopes of mercy: And God accounteth not the ſpirit of bondage beſt, no not for Children. They cannot well be educated in the Love of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48465:62"/>
God, who muſt believe that they are damned if they die, and that God hath not given them any promiſe of life.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Experience of many Moors (ſervants) among us and in our Plantations, (beſides ancient hiſtory) aſſureth us, that delaying Baptiſm till age tendeth to make people delay repentance, and think I am but as I was, and if I ſin longer all will be pardoned at baptiſm, and I muſt after live ſtrictlier, and therefore (as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and many more) they will be baptized Chriſtians when there is no remedy.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And experience aſſureth us that it were the way to work out Chriſtianity and reſtore Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in any Nation: For had not Chriſt early poſſeſſion, and were not <hi>Nations</hi> diſcipled and baptized, Chriſtians were like to be almoſt as thin as Puritans now: and the multitude being Infidels from a croſs intereſt (ſuch as diviſions cauſe) would be ready on all occaſions (as they did in <hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>Monicongo</hi>) to root them out.</p>
                        <p>I take this to be a very concerning conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether in reaſon Infant Baptiſm be like to do more good or harm. The not calling men to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Covenanting at age doth unſpeakable harm: To have a few good words about <hi>Confirmation</hi> in the Liturgie, and ſuch as Doct. <hi>Hammonds</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of it, will not ſave ignorant ungodly ſouls, nor the ſouls of the Paſtors that betray them: I have ſaid my thoughts of this long ago in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Confirmation.</p>
                        <p>But I muſt profeſs that it ſeemeth to me, that if Chriſt had left it to our wills, it is much liker
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48465:62"/>
to tend to the good of ſouls, and the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſtianity, and the ſtrength of the Church, for to have both the <hi>obligation and comfort of our Infant Covenant</hi> and Church ſtate, and <hi>as ſerious a Covenanting alſo at age,</hi> when we paſs into the <hi>Church ſtate of the Adult,</hi> than to be without the former, and left to the expectation of adult ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm alone.</p>

                           <hi>2.</hi> It is the more evident, that a not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ſuch caſes is to be taken for leave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48465:63"/>
God hath put the principle of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſiring our own welfare, and the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Children ſo deeply in humane nature, that he can no more lay it by than he can ceaſe to be a reaſonable creature. And therefore he may lawfully actuate or exerciſe this natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary principle of ſeeking his own or childrens real happineſs, where-ever God doth not reſtrain or prohibit him. We need no poſitive command to ſeek our own or childrens happineſs, but what is in the law of nature it ſelf, and to uſe this where God forbiddeth not, if good be then to be found, cannot be unlawful.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <hi>3.</hi> It is evident from what is ſaid before (and elſewhere) that it is more than a ſilent leave of Infants Church-memberſhip that God hath vouchſafed us. For in the forementioned funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental promiſe, explained more fully in after times, God ſignified his will that ſo it ſhould be. It cannot be denied, but there is ſome hope at leaſt given to them in the firſt promiſe, and that in the general promiſe to the ſeed of the woman they are not excluded, there be no excluding term. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon ſo much encouragement and hope then it is the duty of Parents by the law of nature to enter their Infants into the Covenant, and into that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that partake of theſe hopes, and to liſt them into the Army of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <hi>4.</hi> It is the duty of Parents by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to accept of any allowed or offered benefit for their children. But the relation of a member of Chriſts Church or Army, is an allowed or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered benefit to them, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>Major,</hi>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48465:63"/>
theſe principles in the law of nature do contain it. <hi>1.</hi> That the Infant is not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> but is at his Parents diſpoſe in all things that are for his good. That the Parents have power to oblige their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to any future duty or ſuffering, that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to their own good: and ſo may enter them into Covenants accordingly: And ſo far the will of the Father is as it were the will of the child. <hi>2.</hi> That it is unnaturally ſinful for a Parent to refuſe to do ſuch a thing, when it is to the great benefit of his own child. As if a Prince would offer Honours, and Lordſhips, and Immunities to him and his heirs: if he will not accept this for his heirs, but only for himſelf, it is unnatural. Yea, if he will not oblige his heirs to ſome ſmall and reaſonable conditions for the enjoying ſuch benefits. For the <hi>Minor,</hi> that this relation is an allowed or offered benefit to Infants is manifeſted already, and more ſhall be.</p>
                        <p>And this leads me up to the ſecond point, which I propounded to conſider of; whether by the light or law of nature we can prove that Infants ſhould have the benefit of being Church-members, ſuppoſing it firſt known by ſupernatural revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Parents are of that ſociety, and how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the promiſe is, and how gracious God is. And <hi>1.</hi> It is certain to us by nature that Infants are capable of this benefit, if God deny it not, but will give it them as well as the aged. <hi>2.</hi> It is certain that they are actually members of all the Common-wealths in the world <hi>(perfecte ſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecta membra)</hi> being ſecured from violence by the laws, and capable of honours and right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48465:64"/>
and of being real ſubjects under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to future duties, if they ſurvive. And this ſhews that they are alſo capable of being Church-members, and that nature revealeth to us, that the Infants caſe much followeth the caſe of the Parents, eſpecially in benefits. <hi>3.</hi> Nature hath actually taught moſt people on earth, ſo far as I can learn, to repute their Infants in the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſociety with themſelves, as well as in the ſame civil ſociety. <hi>4.</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Covenant of works (commonly ſo called) or the perfect rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous law that God made with man in his pure nature; the Infants ſhould have been in the Church, and a people holy to God, if the Parents had ſo continued themſelves. And conſider, <hi>1.</hi> That holineſs and righteouſneſs were then the ſame things as now, and that in the eſtabliſhing of the way of propagation, God was no more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to order it ſo, that the children of righteous Parents ſhould have been born with all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their Parents and enjoyed the ſame priviledges, than he was obliged in making the Covenant of Grace to grant that Infants ſhould be of the ſame ſociety with their Parents, and have the immunities of that ſociety. <hi>2.</hi> We have no reaſon when the deſign of redemption is the magnifying of love and grace, to think that love and grace are ſo much leſs under the Goſpel to the members of Chriſt, than under the Law to the members or ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> as that then all the ſeed ſhould have partaked with the ſame bleſſings with the righteous Parents, and now they ſhall all be turned out of the ſociety, whereof the Parents were
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48465:64"/>
members. <hi>5.</hi> God gives us himſelf the reaſons of his gracious dealing with the children of the juſt from his gracious nature, proclaiming even par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy to ſlow thence, <hi>Exod. 34.</hi> and in the ſecond Commandment. <hi>6.</hi> God doth yet ſhew us that in many great and weighty reſpects he dealeth well or ill with children for their Parents ſakes: as many Texts of Scripture ſhew (and I have lately proved at large in one of our private diſputes, that the ſins of nearer parents are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as part of our original or natural guilt.) So much of that.</p>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> YEt before I cite any more particular Texts, I will add this one argument from the tenour of the Covenant of grace, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in many Texts of Scripture. According to the tenour of the Covenant of grace, God will not refuſe to be their God and take them for his people, that are (in a natural or law ſenſe) wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be his people, and to take him for their God. But the Infants of believing Parents are thus willing, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is unqueſtionable. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from the very law of nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed. Infants cannot be actually willing themſelves in natural ſenſe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the reaſon and will of another muſt be theirs in law ſenſe, and that is of the Parents, who have the full diſpoſe of them,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48465:65"/>
and are warranted by the law of nature to chooſe for them (for their good) till they come to uſe of reaſon themſelves. The Parents therefore by the light and law of nature chooſing the better part for their children, and offering and devoting them to God, by the obligation of his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law, he cannot in conſiſtency with the free grace revealed in the Goſpel, refuſe thoſe that are ſo offered. And thoſe that thus come to him in the way that nature it ſelf preſcribeth, he will in no wiſe caſt out, <hi>Joh.</hi> . . And he will be offended with thoſe that would keep them from him, that are offered by thoſe that have the power to do it, though they cannot offer themſelves. For legally this act is taken for their own. Thus I have ſhewed you ſome of the fundamental title that Infants of Believers have to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, and our obligation to dedicate them to God.</p>
                        <p>Reply. <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>ſaith</hi> [that ſome acts of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are legally taken for the childs is not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.] <hi>But here he denieth it, and I leave his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial with my copious proof in my Treatiſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm to the Readers.</hi>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48465:65"/>
done, rather giving us the proof that ſuch a law and promiſe there is that did ſo eſtabliſh it, than being ſuch firſt eſtabliſhing laws or promiſes themſelves. And from hence I may well add this further argument. If there be certain proof in Scripture of Infants Church-memberſhip, but none except this before alledged that makes any mention of the beginning of it, but all ſpeaking of it as no new thing, then we have great reaſon upon the forementioned evidence, to aſſign this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning which from <hi>Gen. 3.</hi> we have expreſt. But the former is true, <hi>ergo,</hi> the later. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Infants were Church-members once. You only conceive it began when <hi>Abraham</hi> was called out of <hi>Ur.</hi> Your conceit hath not a word to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it in the Text. The right to ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was then new to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> firſt believed: But when it began to belong to Infants of Believers in general, no Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this before cited doth mention. Nor doth that promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> intimate any inception then as to the Church-memberſhip of Infants, but only an application of a priviledge to him that in the general was no new thing.</p>
                        <p>Reply. <hi>To this Mr.</hi> T. <hi>ſtill affirmeth that Infants Church-memberſhip was proper to the Hebrews only. Reader, though they had their peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is it credible that the Infants of that one ſmall country only ſhould be ſo differently dealt with by God, from all the world elſe, even</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch<hi>'s,</hi> Noe<hi>'s,</hi> Sem<hi>'s and all from</hi> Adam <hi>to the end of the world, that</hi> theſe Infants only <hi>ſhould be Church-members and</hi> no others? <hi>what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely

So that as ſhe was the root of our nature, we are her natural ſeed; and as ſhe was a believer, and we the ſeed of her a believer, ſo is ſhe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a holy ſeed, and we that are her ſeed are holy, as a people viſibly dedicated to God.</p>

And therefore it is to be noted, that when <hi>Cain</hi> had ſinned by killing

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> NOte alſo, that as God had thus caſt out <hi>Cain,</hi> and ſupplied <hi>Abels</hi> room by <hi>Seth,</hi> and had given each of them poſterity; ſo we find him in a ſpecial manner regiſtring the ſucceſſors of the righteous, and putting two titles on theſe two diſtinct generations, calling ſome the ſons of God, and others the daughters of men, <hi>Gen. 6.2.</hi> Suppoſing that you reject the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that theſe ſons of God were Angels that fell in love with women, the current ordinary expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I think will ſtand, that theſe were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of <hi>Seth,</hi> and other members of the Church, who are called the Sons of God; and that it was the progeny of <hi>Cain,</hi> and other wicked ones, that are called the daughters of men. Where note that they are not themſelves denominated wicked, but the children of men, as being a generation ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church from the birth. And the other are not themſelves affirmed to be truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, but ſons of God, as being the ſeed of the Saints not caſt out, but members of the Church, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48465:67"/>
the ſons of thoſe who were devoted to God, and ſo devoted to him themſelves: a ſeparated gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration belonging to God as his viſible Church. Where note, that theſe that are called the ſons of God, even the line of <hi>Seth</hi> and other godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, were yet ſo wicked that God repented that he made them, and deſtroyed them in the flood, ſparing only <hi>Noah</hi> and his family. So that it was not their own godlineſs, that made them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſons of God, but their relation, Church ſtate and viſible ſeparation from open unchurched Idolaters. Compare this phraſe with the like, <hi>Deut. 14.1. 2 Cor. 6.18.</hi> In the former it is ſaid <hi>[ye are the children of the Lord your God, ye ſhall not cut your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.] where the whole people, Infants and all, are called Gods children, as being a people ſeparated to him from the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous world; and ſo in the next <hi>verſ.</hi> called <hi>a holy people unto God, peculiar to him,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>2 Cor. 6.8. Come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will be a father to you, and you ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.]</hi> So that Gods ſons and daughters are that ſociety that are ſeparated from Idolaters unto the worſhip of God as the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church is. And then it appears that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the righteous, even from the womb, were enumerated to the reſt, in that they are not mentioned as a people called out here and there, and initiated at age (there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuch thing:) but as a ſtock or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration oppoſed to the daughters of men, or of the unchurched, who were ſuch from their infancy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48465:68"/>
as all will grant. For it was not the ſame men that were the Parents of thoſe here called the daughters of men and the ſons of God (though ſome of the later might be excommunicate when they fell:) But it plainly intimates, that it was another ſort of men that theſe were the daughters of, than thoſe that were Parents to the ſons of God. So <hi>Ainſworth in loc.</hi> [The ſons of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the men of the Church of God, for to ſuch <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut. 14.1, &amp;c. 1 John 3.1.</hi> Daughters of men, meaning of <hi>Cains</hi> poſterity that were out of Gods Church, <hi>Gen. 4.14.</hi>] So our Annotations, and many more.</p>
                        <p>An intimation of this priviledge, and that they were ſons of mercy and of the promiſe, appeareth in the very names of many of the children of the righteous, both before and after the flood, which I will not ſtand on particularly.</p>
                        <p>And when all the world had ſo defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that God was reſolved to cut them off; he ſpared <hi>Noah</hi> and his family or ſons. Though <hi>Cham</hi> was to be curſed, yet was he of the Church which worſhipped the true God, and ſpared as a ſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> and one of that ſociety. And if God ſo far ſpared him then for his Fathers ſake as to houſe him in the Ark (the type of the Church) he ſure took him to be of the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in his infancy, and then bare him the ſame favour on the ſame account.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as <hi>Noah</hi> came out of the Ark God bleſſed himſelf in his iſſue, as he did <hi>Adam,</hi> with an [increaſe and multiply] and made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him and his ſeed after him. Which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48465:68"/>
Covenant though the expreſſed part of it be that the earth ſhould be drowned no more, and ſo it was made with the wickedſt of <hi>Noahs</hi> ſeed, and even with the beaſts of the field, yet doth it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a ſpecial favour to <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſeed, as one whom God would ſhew a more ſpecial reſpect to, as he had done in his deliverance, and upon this ſpecial favour to him the creatures fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For though the word [Covenant] be the ſame to man and beaſt, yet the diverſity of the promiſſary and his capacity may put a different ſenſe on the ſame word, as applied to each. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it ſhould ſeem but a ſad bleſſing to <hi>Noah</hi> to hear an [increaſe and multiply] if all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant poſterity muſt be caſt or left out of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and ſo left as common or unclean. This were to encreaſe and multiply the Kingdom of the Devil. If he that was ſo mercifully hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Ark with all his children, muſt now be ſo bleſt as to have all their iſſue to be out of the Church, it were a ſtrange change in God, and a ſtrange bleſſing on <hi>Noah!</hi> And an uncomfortable ſtabliſhing of a Covenant with his ſeed, if all that ſeed muſt be ſo thruſt from God and dealt with as the ſeed of curſed <hi>Cain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover it is certain that <hi>Noah</hi> did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, or at leaſt truly pronounce the bleſſing on <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet.</hi> And in <hi>Shems</hi> bleſſing he bleſſeth the Lord his God, ſhewing that God was his God and ſo in Covenant with him. And it is plain that it is not only the perſons, but the poſterities of his three ſons that <hi>Noah</hi> here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was not <hi>Cham</hi> himſelf ſo much as <hi>Canaan</hi>
                           <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48465:69"/>
and his ſucceeding poſterity that were to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> that is, to their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And the bleſſing muſt be to the iſſue of <hi>Shem,</hi> as well as the curſe to the iſſue of <hi>Cham.</hi> And indeed a Hebrew Doctor would take it ill at that Expoſitor or Divine whatſoever that ſhould preſume to exclude the Infant ſeed of them out of Gods Church. And well they may, if in the bleſſing God be pronounced to be their God, Saith <hi>Ainſworth in loc.</hi> [under this <hi>Shem</hi> alſo himſelf receiveth a bleſſing: for bleſſed is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe God <hi>Jehovah</hi> is, <hi>Pſal. 144.15.</hi> and eternal life is implied herein, for God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for them a City of whom he is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be called their God, <hi>Heb. 11.16.</hi> and <hi>Shem</hi> is the firſt man in Scripture that hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly this honour.]</p>
                        <p>Moreover in <hi>Gen. 9.27.</hi> in <hi>Japhets</hi> bleſſing there is much, though in few words, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe intimated. Firſt, note that the Jewiſh Church is called [the tents of <hi>Shem.</hi>] From whence it appeareth, that the Church priviledges of that people begun not with or from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but were before: And that it is the ſame Church that was of <hi>Shem</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and after all the additional promiſes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Jewiſh Church is ſtill denominated [the tents of <hi>Shem:</hi>] now they were the tents of <hi>Shem</hi> before <hi>Abrahams</hi> days. And therefore it is clear, that it being the ſame Church, muſt be ſuppoſed to have the ſame ſort of members or materials: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infants muſt be members before <hi>Abrahams</hi> days as well as after. That Church which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48465:69"/>
was <hi>Shems</hi> tents had Infant Church-members (for the Jews Church is ſo called, into which <hi>Japhet</hi> was to paſs:) But the Church both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>Shems</hi> tents, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet further let it here be noted, that it is into <hi>Shems</hi> tents that <hi>Japhet</hi> muſt paſs. I ſuppoſe that the evidence is better here for that expoſition that applyeth the word [dwell] to <hi>Japhet</hi> than to God, and ſo that this is ſpoken of the converſion of the Gentiles, as many Expoſitors have cleared at large. And ſo, as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith, the ſenſe is that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> ſhall be [united with the Churches of the Jews, the poſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> which was fulfilled when the Gentiles became joynt-heirs, and of the ſame body, and joynt-partakers of Gods promiſe in Chriſt, the ſtop of the partition-wall being broken down, <hi>&amp;c. Epheſ. 3.6. &amp; 2.14, 19.</hi> Although it may further imply the graffing of <hi>Japhets</hi> children into the ſtock of the Church, when <hi>Shems</hi> poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be cut off, <hi>&amp;c.] vid. ult.</hi> Now if it be <hi>Shems</hi> tents even the ſame Church that <hi>Japhets</hi> children muſt dwell in, then as <hi>Shems</hi> Infants were Church-members, ſo muſt <hi>Japhets,</hi> and not all his Infant ſeed be caſt or left out. So that here is a promiſe of Infant Church-memberſhip unto the Gentiles in theſe words.</p>
                        <p>Reply. <hi>To all this the ſumm of Mr.</hi> T.<hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers are, 1. A denial of the ſenſes given of ſome Texts, which I leave to the Readers exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, being reſolved not to tire him with a tedious Reply. 2. He grants that their perſons were bleſſed, God their God, and their ſeed in the Church: As if Gods open Covenant and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48465:70"/>
promiſe made them not viſible members but invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> WE come next to the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which I ſhall ſay the leſs to, becauſe you confeſs it. But again note, that whereas your ſelf make the beginning of Gods taking the Jews to be his people, and ſo of Infants to be members of the Church, to be at <hi>Abrahams</hi> call from <hi>Ur; 1.</hi> There is no one word of that in the Text. <hi>2. Lot</hi> came out of <hi>Ur</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea, and from <hi>Haran,</hi> and lived with him: were not <hi>Lot</hi> and his Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers then?</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <hi>3.</hi> The chief note I intend is this, that there is no more ſaid then to prove Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, than what we have ſhewed was ſaid long before, and is ſaid after of the Gentiles Infants, no nor ſo much. If therefore the paſſage of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> out of <hi>Ur,</hi> yea, or the promiſe made to him in <hi>Haran, Gen. 12.2, 3.</hi> will prove Infants Church-memberſhip, then have we as good proof of it to the Gentile Church as to the Jews.</p>
                        <p>And here I note further, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before the command for Circumciſion, you plainly yield that Infants Church-memberſhip is a thing ſeparable from Circumciſion, and begun not with it, but before. And indeed I have evinced that to you in my Book of Baptiſm. <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was not made a member by Circumciſion,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48465:70"/>
but circumciſed becauſe a member of Chriſts Church by faith. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was a member before, and ſo was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the Infants born in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> houſe.</p>
                        <p>Whether there were any promiſe or precept of this (but a meer tranſeunt fact) let the Text laſt mentioned, and the following bear witneſs. Gen. <hi>12.2, 3. In thee ſhall all families of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> and, Gen. <hi>17.7, 9, 10. And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee and thy ſeed after thee — and I will be their God. And God ſaid to</hi> Abraham, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy ſeed after thee in their generations. This is my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which you ſhall keep between me and you,</hi> &amp;c. to verſ. <hi>15.</hi> In all this let theſe things be noted, <hi>1.</hi> That here is an expreſs promiſe or Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. <hi>2.</hi> That it is not only <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> but for the future, called an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>3.</hi> That this promiſe or Covenant doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly imply and include Infants Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip (as you confeſs.) <hi>4.</hi> That yet here is not the leaſt word that intimates an inſtitution of it <hi>de novo,</hi> but rather the contrary plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The promiſes before <hi>Gen. 17.</hi> are mainly about the multiplication of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. What is that to Church—memberſhip? (except what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the promiſed ſeed, of which anon.) <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> hath a promiſe alſo of the multiplication of <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> ſeed. And the very precept of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is only one part of the Infant members, <hi>viz.</hi> the males, and therefore it cannot be foundation
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48465:71"/>
of their Church-memberſhip, which leaves out half the members. <hi>5.</hi> Note that the promiſe that God will be their God, doth expreſly contain the Church-memberſhip of the ſeed. <hi>6.</hi> Note that this is more than a tranſeunt fact, <hi>Ergo,</hi> being an everlaſting Covenant. Had it been a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tranſeunt fact, that had left no permanent ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle behind it in the obligation of the Covenant, then it had been null and void as ſoon as ſpoken: then the word of God is but a bare ſound and of no further force. <hi>7.</hi> Note that the Apoſtle (as is ſaid) <hi>Rom. 4.10, 11, 12, 13.</hi> doth fully manifeſt to us, that this promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a believer, and that Circumciſion was a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith which he had, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncircumciſed: and therefore that the chief part of the Covenant of having God for our God, and his taking us as his peculiar people, belongs to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews. <hi>8.</hi> And he oft ſheweth that the faithful are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and therefore the chief bleſſings of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe belong to all the faithful. But one of the bleſſings was, that their Infants ſhould be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the ſame Church and Covenant, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Infants of the faithful who are the heirs of the ſame promiſe, muſt be comprehended in it too.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <hi>9.</hi> I think it is not to be made light of as to this matter, that in the great promiſe, <hi>Gen. 12.3.</hi> the bleſſing from <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt is promiſed to all the families or tribes on earth, <hi>all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> as the <hi>Heb. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. Arabic.</hi> or <hi>all the kindreds</hi> as the vulgar <hi>Lat.</hi> and <hi>Chald. paraph.</hi> or <hi>all the tribes</hi> as the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48465:71"/>
                           <hi>Sept.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. And doubtleſs it is by Chriſt that this bleſſing is promiſed, and ſo a Goſpel bleſſing (<hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Syriac.</hi> adds <hi>and in thy ſeed,</hi> and the <hi>Arab.</hi> hath <hi>by thee.</hi>) And the Apoſtle fully teſtifieth that. So that as tribes, kindreds, families, do moſt certainly comprehend the Infants, and as it was to ſuch families that the promiſe was made before Chriſt as to the Jewiſh Church, ſo is it expreſly to ſuch families or tribes that the promiſe is made as to the Gentiles ſince Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="10">
                           <hi>10.</hi> Note that as Infant Church-memberſhip is here clearly implied in Infant Circumciſion, ſo they are two diſtinct things; and as the ſign is here commanded <hi>de novo,</hi> ſo the thing ſignified (I mean the duty of engaging and devoting to God as their God in Covenant) is commanded with it, though not <hi>de novo,</hi> as a thing now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning as the ſign did. So that here is in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion not only a command to do the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing outward act, but alſo to do it as a ſign of the Covenant, and ſo withal for the Parents to engage their children to God in Covenant as their God, and devote them to him as his ſeparated pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people. So that here are two diſtinct du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concurrent. The one external newly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, the other internal not newly inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therefore the former may ceaſe, and yet the later ſtand: and it is no proof that the later (Covenant engagement of Infants to God) is ceaſed, becauſe the ſign of Circumciſion is ceaſed; no more than it proves that ſuch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant engagement did then begin when Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did begin; or that women were not Church-members
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48465:72"/>
ſeparated, engaged, dedicated to God in Infancy, becauſe they were not circumciſed. And no more than you can prove that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was unchurched in the wilderneſs when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed for <hi>40</hi> years. So that here you have a command for entring Infants as Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And ſo you ſee both promiſe and precept in <hi>Gen. 12.3. &amp; Gen. 17.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when I conſider the Parents, breeding and manners of <hi>Rebekah,</hi> I think it far more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſhe was a Church-member from her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, than that ſhe was entred afterwards at age, or that ſhe was a heathen or infidel when <hi>Iſaac</hi> married her.</p>
                        <p>And as here are before mentioned ſtanding Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, ſo it is to be noted how God intimateth the extent of the main bleſſing of them to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed, not only in the expreſs promiſe of the bleſſing to all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or families on earth (of which before) but in the aſſigned reaſon of the bleſſing which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to <hi>Abraham</hi> with other true believers. For <hi>Gen. 22.16, 17, 18.</hi> it is thus alledged [becauſe thou haſt done this thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed, becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice.] And <hi>Gen. 26.3, 4, 5.</hi> the Covenant is renewed with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the ſame reaſon aſſigned, [becauſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my ſtatutes and my laws.] How mans obedience is ſaid to be a cauſe of Gods bleſſing, I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining; but taking the words as I find them in general, I may conclude, that they are here
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48465:72"/>
given as a cauſe or reaſon of it ſome way or other? And though a ſpecial mercy may be given on a common ground or reaſon, yet where there is no apparent proof of the reſtriction, we are to judge the bleſſing common where the reaſon is common: At leaſt, if a ſpecial bleſſing be ſuperadded to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed (upon the freeneſs of Gods grace, or the eminency of <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience,) yet there goes with it a mercy common to all where the reaſon of the mercy is found. It being therefore the caſe of every true believer to be faithful and obedient, yea, to prefer that before his own life, and not a ſon only, it may be hence gathered, that God who bleſſed <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, will bleſs theirs on the ſame, with the ſame bleſſings in the main (as to his favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them) though not with the ſame in the variable ſuperadditionals or overplus of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things.</p>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> THe promiſe to the whole people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Infants and all, that they ſhould be [a peculiar people, a Kingdom of Prieſts, and a holy Nation,] <hi>Exod 19.5, 6.</hi> you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. This is a promiſe, and not a tranſeunt fact which made no promiſe. And the people are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to keep Gods Covenant, that they might have this promiſe fulfilled to them. Yea, if you had ſaid, that it was a meer tranſeunt Covenant or promiſe, reaching but to the perſons then exiſtent, and dying with them, though you had ſpoken more ſenſe, yet no more truth than when you denied the law and promiſe, and ſubſtituted a tranſeunt fact. For, <hi>1.</hi> It is expreſly a promiſe <hi>de futuro</hi> to a Nation. <hi>2.</hi> Yea, and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> giveth the ſame titles to believers under the Goſpel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating the fulfilling of the promiſe even to them, as the promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> was to the faithful who were his uncircumciſed ſeed. However, here is a Covenant granting by way of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bleſſing of Church-memberſhip to Infants with the reſt of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> For certainly, this pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and holineſs, and prieſthood here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, containeth their Church-memberſhip: It is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48465:73"/>
undeniable therefore, that ſuch Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is here granted by Promiſe or Covenant, not as a thing then beginning, but by way of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the like former grants. And it is to be noted, that though this promiſe is made to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet not to be fulfilled to any of them, but on condition that they [obey Gods voice, and keep his Covenant,] <hi>verſ. 5.</hi> on which conditions alſo any other might have then enjoyed the ſame bleſſing, and therefore ſo may do now.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Deut. 17.1, 2.</hi> The Infants with the reſt are called the children of God, and a holy and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people to the Lord their God.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Deut. 26.14, 18.</hi> the Covenant is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>[Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and keep his ſtatutes, and his commandments, and his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to hearken to his voice. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promiſed thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that thou maiſt be an holy people,</hi> &amp;c. Is here no promiſe, when the promiſe is expreſt? and is here no Covenant, where the mutual Covenant is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed? And I think you grant that Infants are included.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Deut. 28.4, 9.</hi> Where the promiſe to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that if they hearken to Gods voice and obſerve his Commandments, they ſhall be bleſſed in the fruit of their bodies; and the Lord will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them a holy people to himſelf, as he had ſworn unto them.] Here is not only a Covenant and Promiſe for the future, but alſo an oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it, as annexed to the ſame before. Is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48465:74"/>
this eſtabliſhing Covenant on Promiſe but a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeunt fact? or doth not this confirm their right to the benefit promiſed, which was received before by the ſame means?</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Ezra 9.2.</hi> They are called the holy ſeed.</p>
                        <p>Of that in <hi>Deut. 29.</hi> I have formerly ſpoke enough. It is called a Covenant. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> with their little ones did enter the Covenant and the oath with God, and which he made to them. It was a Covenant, <hi>to eſtabliſh them for a people to himſelf, and that he may be to them a God, as he had before ſaid and ſworn.</hi> It is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made even with them that ſtood not there, whether it be meant only of the ſucceſſive <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (and then it is not a tranſeunt Covenant) or of all people whoever that will accept of the ſame terms (and then it's not proper to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>) It is a Covenant not made to them as meer <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> but as obedient to the Covenant terms, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant breaking would cut them off, <hi>verſ. 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26.</hi> Is not Church-memberſhip contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, <hi>Gods being their God, and taking them for his people thus in Covenant?</hi> Doth not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe give them an eſtabliſhed right in this bleſſing? Is all this then no promiſe, but a tranſeunt fact?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Deut. 30.19.</hi> There is a law and promiſe, <hi>chooſe life, that thou and thy ſeed may live.</hi> This is the ſame Covenant which <hi>Aſa</hi> cauſed the people to enter, <hi>2 Chron. 15.</hi> and if there had been no law for it, there would have been no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and then he would not have made it death to withdraw.

                           <hi>Mr.</hi> T. — <hi>For</hi> the ſole efficient cauſe being actually <hi>put (as the Covenant and the Parents believing are,</hi> Deut. <hi>29.</hi>) the effect muſt be in act: but it is not ſo in the unborn: <hi>therefore the Covenant and Parents faith are not the ſole efficient — ſo that though the Covenant give a Right to a bleſſing, yet it doth not make actually viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church-members, without ſome other tranſeunt fact</hi> —</p>
                        <p>Reply. <hi>(The reſt let the Reader make his beſt of.) We are it ſeems by this time in a fair way of agreement, and have almoſt done our work. It ſeemeth by this time he could find in his heart to grant that the Covenant is</hi> an efficient cauſe, <hi>though not the</hi> ſole efficient: <hi>well, we will not ſtick on that: Gods love and revelation, and Chriſts merits ſhall be antecedent chief efficients: And he ſeemeth now inſtead of ſaying ſtill that</hi> [It is only by the Phyſical tranſeunt fact] <hi>to be content if we will ſay,</hi> it is not till or without that fact, <hi>that is,</hi> that men are not members of the Church till they are men. <hi>We will not be ſo ſowre as to deny him that much. And indeed is this all at the upſhot? But I will not grant him the logical notion too eaſily, though we will not quarrel about it. I think a</hi> cauſe materially <hi>may long exiſt before the</hi> effect, <hi>though it be not</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter cauſa <hi>till it effect: And I think that</hi> Gods conditional Covenant <hi>or</hi> Promiſe, <hi>is but</hi> cauſa vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualis &amp; aptitudinalis <hi>till it</hi> effect, <hi>and yet may be the</hi> ſole proximate efficient <hi>of our</hi> Right af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: <hi>I think the childs</hi> being born <hi>did not</hi>

effect <hi>his</hi> Right <hi>to Church Relation, nor doth</hi> our Faith <hi>now, nor the</hi> Parents faith <hi>or</hi> conſent, <hi>but only as a</hi> condition make men capable Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. <hi>And I think the</hi> effect <hi>may begin</hi> de novo <hi>without any change in the</hi> efficient, <hi>upon a change in the</hi> Recipient: <hi>And that the Sun unchanged is the proximate efficient of motion, light and heat, to the next exiſtent wight that received not his influx before it did exiſt: And the Covenant or Donative Inſtrument of God which ſaith</hi> [He that believeth ſhall be juſtified] <hi>may effect my Juſtification when I believe and not before, though</hi> my faith effect <hi>it not at all, but</hi> diſpoſe the recipient. <hi>But I deny that the</hi> Parents faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put, all the capacity of the recipient is put, <hi>even when he is</hi> born: <hi>For if it be poſſible for the Parent to conſent for himſelf and not for his child, and to devote himſelf and not his child to God, part of the condition of reception is wanting.</hi>

                        <p>R. B. <hi>THe ſecond Commandment,</hi> Exod. 20.5, 6. Deut. 5.9, 10. <hi>I think is a law, and containeth a promiſe or premiant part, wherein he promiſeth to ſhew mercy to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or children of them that love him and keep his Commandments: of which I have alſo ſpoken elſewhere, to which I refer you. I ſee no reaſon to doubt but here is a ſtanding promiſe, and diſcovery of Gods reſolution, concerning the children of all that love him, whether Jews or Gentiles, to whom this Commandment belongs: nor to doubt whether this mercy imply Church-memberſhip: And that this is fetcht from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gracious nature of God, I find in his proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name to</hi> Moſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> If this mercy here imply Church-memberſhip to the Infants of them that love him to a thouſand Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, then it implieth it to all the Infants in the world — But there is nothing to prove that this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy muſt be Church-memberſhip, or that it muſt be to all the children of them that love God, or that it muſt be to them in Infancy — I incline to conceive this a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of temporal mercies, chiefly to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> —</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. That it is not only of <hi>temporal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> the <hi>words [Love</hi> and <hi>Hate</hi>] as the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Parents, ſeem to prove; and the joyning the children to the <hi>Parents</hi> in the retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution: And all the terms ſeem above ſuch a ſenſe: It is the revenge <hi>of a jealous God on Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to his <hi>Lovers</hi> that is ſpoken of:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48465:76"/>
And the joyning this Command to the firſt which ſetleth our relation to God, with the Laws an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed in <hi>Deut.</hi> for the cutting off whole Cities (Parents and Children) that turn from God to Idols, ſheweth that it reached to <hi>Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. And that it was not only to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (whatever you <hi>chiefly</hi> mean) is proved both in that it is in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and the <hi>proclaimed name of God,</hi> Exod. 34.5, 6. and exemplified throughout the Scripture and in the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the extent, we can hardly expect that the world ſhould endure a thouſand <hi>Generations:</hi> Therefore it can mean but that God who bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the puniſhment to the third and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, will ſet no bounds to the ſucceſſion of his mercies while our capacity continueth. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the mercies be, the expoſition of this <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> concerneth <hi>you</hi> as much as <hi>me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. As to the conditions, I doubt not but it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that the child at age imitate the Parents in their <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hatred,</hi> duty or ſin: And that if on Repentance the Parent be forgiven, his ſin may not be viſited to the third and fourth. And if a child of Godly Parents turn wicked, the <hi>right</hi> is <hi>intercepted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. But the Commandment with the foreſaid expoſition ſhews, that God meaneth that his Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And it ſpeaketh ſuch a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi> as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

in reaſon be conceived to belong to them without, and can mean no leſs than Gods viſible favour, by which the Church is differenced from the world, when <hi>Lovers</hi> and <hi>Haters</hi> are diſtinguiſhed ſides.</p>
                        <p>And when God hath <hi>Recorded</hi> this <hi>decreed granted diſtinguiſhed mercy</hi> to the <hi>children of the faithful as ſuch in the Tables of ſtone,</hi> ſure it is a <hi>viſible notification,</hi> which will make them <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble favorites</hi> and <hi>Church-members</hi> as ſoon as they viſibly exiſt.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>quatenus</hi> ſeemeth to me to prove that it extendeth to <hi>all the children of the faithful,</hi> becauſe it is to them <hi>as ſuch.</hi> But it followeth not that it muſt extend to them <hi>all alike,</hi> as to <hi>equal mercies,</hi> nor yet that the ſin of Parents after may make no kind of forfeiture. But of this I have ſaid more in my <hi>Chriſtian Directory.</hi>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> IF you ſay that the word [ſeed] doth not neceſſarily include Infants. I anſwer, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are part of the ſeed of the righteous, yea all their ſeed are firſt Infants. If therefore God have made general promiſes as to age and perſon, who is he that dare limit it, without juſt proof that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God hath limited it? Doth God ſay, that the ſeed of the righteous are not bleſſed till they come to age? If he pronounce the ſeed bleſſed, they muſt be bleſſed, when they are firſt ſuch a ſeed: And if any one age might be more included than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one would think it muſt be that wherein they are ſo meerly the ſeed of ſuch as that they ſtand not on any diſtinct account of their own actual faith or unbelief. For the ſeed of the righteous, as ſuch, have a promiſed bleſſing: But the ſeed of the righteous turning themſelves to unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do turn from that bleſſing, and become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe I have already been more tedious than you expected: I will therefore add no more of theſe paſſages of Scripture, having ſaid that which ſatisfieth me formerly to the ſame purpoſe, and having yet ſeen nothing that leaves me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied. And alſo becauſe one text either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch a Law or Covenant as you call for, or declaring to us that God did make ſuch a Law or Covenant, is as good as a thouſand in point of authority.</p>

                           <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>not holding children in the womb un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to be viſible Church-members, all this may be retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They are part of the ſeed of the righteous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Reply. <hi>The whole ſeed (in the womb and born) are taken into this relation to God which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth his bleſſing on them as ſeparated from the wicked, according to their capacity: An Infant in the womb is viſibly ſeparated to God, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate</hi> viſibility <hi>from the notoriety or viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods promiſe that doth it: But the</hi> perſon <hi>is not</hi> viſible <hi>to you, though ſenſible to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As Chriſt was the Head in the womb, ſo far Infants are members; the Parents then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately devoting them to God: I told you before, the</hi> viſibility <hi>of our ſtate hath ſeveral gradations. To quibble thus on all Gods promiſes to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithful by queſtions and exceptions about embryo's, abortives,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is vanity.</hi>

                           <hi>R. B.</hi> THE next Queſtion that I ſpould ſpeak to is, whether theſe Laws, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, or Promiſes, are capable of a revocation, or repeal? and I ſhall take this for a queſtion that needs no further debate, among men that know what a Law or Promiſe is. Gods immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability and perfection may make ſome Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealable, while the ſubject remains: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the thing it ſelf is capable of it. Only where a Promiſe or Law is but for a limited time, when the time is expired it ceaſeth, and the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48465:79"/>
is as to the nulling of it, equal to a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or abrogation. I put in this queſtion, leſt you ſhould hereafter change your mind and ſay, that indeed it is a law, or promiſe, or covenant, by which the right of Church-memberſhip is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and Infants dedicated to God: but it is but a tranſeunt Law or Covenant.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo, then it is either immediately or preſently tranſeunt, or at a certain limited time only, when it will ceaſe. The former is certainly falſe and intolerable. For, <hi>1.</hi> They are promiſes and laws for the future, and therefore ceaſe not immediately. <hi>2.</hi> That were to make God the moſt unfaithful promiſes and mutable Law-maker in the world, if his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and his laws ceaſe as ſoon as they are made. Nay it makes them to be no laws or promiſes. <hi>3.</hi> It was one ſtanding law and promiſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Nation of the Jews ſucceſſively. And God did not make his promiſe anew to every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant that was made a Church-member, nor renew his law to every Parent to enter their Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Covenant by the ſign of Circumciſion. Were not the uncircumciſed <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs made members by the efficacy of the former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God remaining in force. And did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Laws oblige to Circumciſion till Chriſt? Elſe there were but few members, nor but few that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed warrantably, if the promiſe and precept did extend but to the perſon that it was firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to, and every one elſe muſt likewiſe have a perſonal promiſe and precept. The Mother of Chriſt cannot then be proved to have been a Church-member in Infancy. If it be ſaid that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48465:79"/>
theſe promiſes were limited in the making of them, to a certain time when they were to ceaſe, I ſay when that is proved we ſhall believe it, which I have not yet ſeen done.</p>
                        <p>And it falls in with the laſt queſtion, which is, whether theſe promiſes be indeed revoked and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and theſe laws repealed or ceaſed. And here it is that I have long expected your ſolid proof, together with the ſatisfactory anſwer to my arguments to the contrary. And ſo I ſhall leave this task in your hands. Sure I am that Chriſt never came to caſt out of the Church, but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more in: much leſs to caſt out all the Infants, even all of that age in which himſelf was head of that Church: But to gather together in one the children of God that were ſcattered, <hi>John 11.52.</hi> And therefore he would oft have gathered all <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judaea,</hi> even the National Church that then was, unto himſelf, as the true head, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and they would not. It was not becauſe he would not (as intending a new frame, where Infants could have no place) but becauſe they would not, and ſo caſt out themſelves and their Infants. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the joy of the formerly deſolate Gentiles, that they ſhall have many more children than ſhe that had an <hi>Husband,</hi> and not fewer, <hi>Gal. 4.25, 26, 27.</hi> And we as <hi>Iſaac</hi> are children of the promiſe, even that promiſe which extended to the Infants with the Parents. <hi>Gal. 4.28.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> T. — <hi>I conceived a</hi> Promiſe not <hi>in</hi> congruous ſenſe repealable: <hi>For although a promiſe be a Law to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48465:80"/>
yet I know not how congruouſly it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed: 'Tis true, the act of promiſing being tranſeunt ceaſeth; but that cannot be repealed: that which is done cannot be</hi> infectum, <hi>not done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Reply. <hi>I perceive we muſt diſpute our firſt principles, as well as our Baptiſm. Reader, Gods promiſe in queſtion is not a particular promiſe to ſome one perſon only, but his</hi> Recorded Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of</hi> Donation, <hi>or ſtabliſhed</hi> written <hi>or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued word, which is the</hi> ſign <hi>of his will: It is the ſame thing which is called, the</hi> Premiant <hi>or</hi> Donative <hi>part of his Law, in one reſpect, and his Teſtament in another, and his Donation or Gift in another, and his</hi> Covenant <hi>as</hi> Conditional <hi>in another, and his Promiſe in another. As</hi> [He that believeth ſhall be ſaved] <hi>is the</hi> Rewarding <hi>or</hi> Giving <hi>part of a Law, and it is a Teſtament, a Covenant, a Promiſe, a Gift, all theſe. Mr.</hi> T. <hi>cannot ſee how this promiſe can be repealed: what, not an univerſal promiſing Law, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Inſtrument? The queſtion is not whether it</hi> ever was repealed, <hi>but whether it be</hi> repealea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>in congruous ſenſe. Why may not the King make a Law that every one that killeth ſuch and ſuch hurtful creatures (a Fox,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>or that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth an enemy in war, ſhall have ſuch a reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and repeale this Law or Promiſe when he ſeeth cauſe? I think the firſt Covenant ceaſed by mans ſin, without repeal. But I cannot ſay that no promiſe to the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>was repealed, upon their ſin! The non-performance of the condition depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the party of the benefit while it is unrepeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but may not God thereupon repeal the Law
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48465:80"/>
or Covenant, and null the very offer to poſterity? Is it not ſo as to the Jews policie and peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What pains is taken in the Epiſtle to the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>to prove the change of the Covenant as faulty in compariſon of that which had better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? But if you will call it a meer</hi> ceſſation, <hi>all is one as to our queſtion in hand.</hi>

                        <p>R.B. Queſt. 2. <hi>IF (as you ſay) it was on the Jews rejection of Chriſt that they were broken off from being Gods people, were thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Jews that believed in Chriſt ſo broken off, or not, who continued ſucceſſively a famous Church at</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>which came to be a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal ſeat. Whether then were not the children of the Diſciples and all believing Jews Church-members in Infancy? If no, then it was ſomewhat elſe than unbelief that broke them off.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> They were broken off from the Jewiſh Church, not by unbelief, but by faith in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> This is too ſhort an anſwer to ſo great an evidence againſt you. The Infants of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Jews were the day before their Converſion members of the Jewiſh Church and of Gods uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, of which the Jews were but a part: For as he that is a member of the City is a member of the Kingdom, and a part of a part is a part of the whole, ſo every member of the Jews Church was a member of Gods univerſal Church. Now, 1. The very Jews policy totally ceaſed not till the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at leaſt. 2. But if it had, I ask, was it no mercy to be a member both of the Jews Church and the univerſal? If not, the Jews loſt nothing by being broken off? If yea, how did the Chriſtians Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren forfeit it? Was it better to be of no viſible Church, than of the univerſal? The Jews were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48465:81"/>
broken off by unbelief: you ſay Chriſtians In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were put out of that and the whole viſible Church by faith, or without unbelief.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48465:83"/>
which is a tranſeunt thing not repealable?]</p>
                        <p>But either by this fact you mean Legiſlation and Covenant-making, or not: if you do, what a ſaying is it that Infants were made Church-members not by Covenant, but by a Covenant-making, not by a Law, but by a Law-making? If not, either you muſt ſay, that God makes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without any law, and gives right to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit without any promiſe, or Covenant-grant as the cauſe; or elſe, that it is no benefit to have right to Church-memberſhip, and no duty to enter into that relation, and to accept of that benefit, and to be devoted to God. Which ever of theſe ways you chuſe (and one you muſt chuſe, or change your opinion) hath the world heard of any more unreaſonable and ridiculous, or elſe more unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Divine, from a learned ſober man of that profeſſion?

                        <p n="2">2. But it was in a private letter, extorted by his importunity, and publiſhed to the world by himſelf and not by me; who confeſs that this plainneſs was too great for me to have uſed to him publickly: But ſecret admonition diſparageth him not to others. It hath now been by himſelf about nineteen years divulged to the world, and I did not ſo much as trouble his patience by a word of anſwer, and little thought ever to do it: But Major <hi>Danvers</hi> his loud invitation hath drawn me to give them this Farewell.</p>
                        <p>THE Reader muſt here take notice that I am not here called to prove Infants Church-memberſhip out of the New Teſtament, but to ſhew out of the Old that they were viſible Church-members before by a Grant or Covenant, which Chriſt hath not repealed. The reſt (out of the New-Teſtament) I have done long ago in my Treatiſe of Infant Church-memberſhip and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is ſo much diſpleaſed at. And indeed I think that the proofs are plain, though many objections may be difficult to be anſwered,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48465:88"/>
eſpecially by thoſe who have not throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the caſe. When I ſet together Chriſts own Infant memberſhip, and his kind reception of Infants, and his chiding thoſe that would have kept them off, and his offers of taking in all the Jewiſh Nation into his Church, and that they were broken off by unbelief, and conſequently the ſeed of Believers not broken off from the Church univerſal, and that whole houſholds are oft ſaid to be baptized, and that <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers children holy, and that Chriſt expreſly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. commandeth his Miniſters as much as in them lieth to Diſciple all <hi>Nations</hi> baptizing, and it's propheſied that the Kingdoms of the world ſhall be made the Kingdoms of Chriſt, and there is no Nation or Kingdom on earth that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not members of; All this and much more ſeemeth to me a plain revelation of Gods will, that as he never had a Church which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Infants, ſo he doth not now exclude them. And it is expreſly ſaid of the Jews that they were all <hi>baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud and in the ſea,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.2. where doubtleſs the Apoſtle in the <hi>name</hi> had reſpect to our being <hi>baptized into Chriſt,</hi> of which theirs was a typical Baptiſm; And it is not ſaid in vain that they were [<hi>all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized</hi>] including their Infants, but as part of the Analogie, as if he had ſaid [<hi>As we now are all baptized into Chriſt.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Theſe things ſeem to me a certain notificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods will herein; which in the foreſaid former Treatiſe I have fullier opened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. And ſhould I ſtand to anſwer all the

Mr. <hi>T.</hi> elſewhere pleadeth that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſpeaketh of the Church-inviſible only, and yet now he maketh it to be the viſible. 2 [All] is oft put for the <hi>Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and not a proper <hi>univerſality:</hi> And it ſeemeth hard to prove that every viſible member <hi>hath the ſpirit,</hi> which is expreſly there ſaid of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, though whether Baptiſm and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be included, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> elſewhere maketh diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. But I grant that it is ſpoken of the Church as viſible, and that all the members ordinarily having <hi>Spiritus Sacramentum,</hi> are in judgement of charity ſaid to have the Spirit. 3. But if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be indeed here included as he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then Baptiſm is firſt included: and ſo if we prove Infants Church-members, this Text will prove them to be baptizable, according to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Remember that. 4. But that Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s expoſition is not true, <hi>that every member drinketh of the Cup in the Lords Supper,</hi> he may be turned about to confeſs himſelf: For, 1. Doubtleſs he thinks that this Chapter ſpeaketh of the Church not only as viſible (if at all) but as inviſible alſo; and he oft ſaith that many real members of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48465:89"/>
have not the Sacrament. 2. By this his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, his adult Baptizing ſhould not make or prove any to be viſible Church-members till they drink of the Cup; though it were a year or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years. 3. And no one that liveth without the Lords Supper through ſcruples (about Church-orders, or their own fitneſs, which are the caſes of multitudes) ſhould be viſible members: Nor thoſe that live where they cannot have the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Nor any Lay-man in all the Popiſh Church, where the Cup is denied the Laity.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. To the Minor, Infants might be baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one ſpirit by the initiating Sacrament, in order to the reſt to be partaked of in due time: And as not every <hi>Church-ſuſpenſion,</hi> ſo <hi>Natural-ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of further priviledges, nullifieth not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip.</p>

                              <hi>Mr.</hi> T. 2. <hi>From</hi> 1 Cor. 10.17. <hi>All that were one body and one bread did partake of that one bread which was broken: But no Infant did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> —</p>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Chriſt and his Diſciples</hi> did not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it before the inſtitution: 2. No baptized perſons partake of it in the interſpace between the two Sacraments: which with ſome is a long time: 3. A baptized perſon may die before he drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Cup; or may live where it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be had. 4. Church-members may be ſuſpended from the Lords Table. Therefore the text ſpeaketh not of every member, but of the ordinary communion of capable perſons.</p>

                              <hi>Mr.</hi> T. Eph. 4.5. <hi>The whole Church is one bodie, and hath one Lord, and one faith: But no Infant hath one faith</hi>]</p>
                           <p>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is ſpoken of the generality of the nobleſt and capable members, denominating the Church: The Apoſtle ſaith not that every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hath all theſe, but [<hi>There is one Lord, one faith,</hi> &amp;c.] Chriſt had not <hi>one Lord</hi> (being Lord himſelf as here underſtood) and yet was a member: Chriſt in the womb cannot be proved to have actually h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>d that one faith; and he was long the chief member before he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized: And whether ever the twelve Apoſtles were, is uncertain.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Text ſeemeth chiefly to ſpeak of the <hi>Doctrine of faith,</hi> called <hi>objective faith; one Creed:</hi> And this the Church might have, and yet not each member actually believe. For, 3. The Parent in faith devoting himſelf and his Infant to God, his Faith and Conſent is reputatively the Childs, who is uſed as a member of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

                              <hi>Mr.</hi> T. 3. <hi>They were no members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, who were left out of the number of the whole Church, all the Believers, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Diſciples,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But Infants are left out of the number in all places in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Ergo: —</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Many texts ſpeak of <hi>all that were preſent</hi> only; and many ſpeak only of ſuch as the preſent matter did concern: And it is moſt uſual to denominate <hi>All</hi> or the <hi>Body</hi> from the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt</hi> and <hi>Greateſt</hi> part. If you were to deſcribe a Kingdom, would you not ſay that it is a Civil Society of rational creatures (or men) conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mutual Relations of King and Subjects
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48465:90"/>
and the duties of each for the common welfare? You would ſo define it as that <hi>Reaſon, Conſent</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> ſhould be in the definition. Infants have none of theſe in act, and yet who doubteth but Infants are members of the Kingdom (of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingdom under Heaven that I have read of?) So you know that we take Infants to be members of our Churches now: And yet is it not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with us to ſay that <hi>all the Church met to hear, or to do this or that?</hi> When yet the Infants and many others might be abſent.</p>
                           <p>The Texts Mr. <hi>T.</hi> alledgeth are, Acts 1.15. <hi>The number of the names together were about</hi> 120.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though I take not the Church then to be ſo numerous as ſome do, yet reaſon is reaſon: Can we think that when Chriſt <hi>was ſeen after his reſurrection of more than</hi> 500 <hi>Brethren at once,</hi> that only 120 of them were Chriſtians? And can we think that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> and many more, were not timerous faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Chriſtians? It's like that the text mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this 120 was the number of thoſe bold confirmed Chriſtians who ſo quickly after Chriſts death appeared in open profeſſion and conjunction with the Apoſtles, and had opportunity to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that time and place.</p>
                           <p>The next is Act. 2.1. <hi>They were all with one accord in one place.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> This needeth no other anſwer than as before. The other texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.4, 23, 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.11, 13, 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.1, 2, 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. need no other anſwer:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48465:91"/>
His expoſition would ſometimes exclude women, and ſometimes many of the men: Doth he believe no man or woman was a member of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.22. who did not <hi>ſend men of their own company?</hi> Nor any man or woman a member of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that did not being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered go about Preaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. it is ſaid, <hi>You may all propheſie,</hi> and yet wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are forbidden.</p>

                              <hi>Mr.</hi> T. 4. <hi>They were no part of the Chriſtian Church viſible to whom the things aſcribed to the whole Church did not agree: But the things aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the whole Chriſtian Church viſible did not agree to Infants:</hi> Ergo—</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is fully anſwered already. It is moſt uſual to aſcribe that to a Church or other Society which is done only by the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part. As I ſaid before, when rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Contract, Intention, are aſcribed to a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; which is conſtituted by the conſent of King and Subjects: and yet Infants are members who conſent not, ſave by their Parents. <hi>The Church meeteth to chooſe a Paſtor,</hi> when yet the women meet not: The Church admoniſheth a faulty member, when every woman doth not admoniſh him: Our Churches meet all to hear, when Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren meet not, whom we take for members: Theſe are not ſatisfactory allegations, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common uſe of words, and to many texts of Scripture.</p>

                              <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>The Minor is proved,</hi> Matth. 16.18. <hi>On this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> viz. <hi>by Preaching.</hi>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> When Preaching converted the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they devoted themſelves to God, and all that were in their truſt and power; and that Preaching brought in by conſequence the Infants that did not hear. I prove it, 1. Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the diſcipling of Nations and baptizing them (that is, as much as in the Preacher lieth:) But Infants are part of thoſe Nations: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commandeth the diſcipling and baptizing of Infants, (as much as in the Preacher lay,) which could be done but by the ſucceſs of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Parents. 2. <hi>The Kingdoms of the world are made the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt: But Infants are members of all thoſe Kingdoms:</hi> But this is done at large elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> When a man thinks only what to ſay for his cauſe, and never thinks what can be ſaid againſt it, his judgement is of little value. 1. All that agreeth to Infants which was requiſite to a viſible Infant member before Chriſts coming; And do you not confeſs that they were members then among the Jews? 2. Did nothing in Chriſt himſelf in Infancy agree with viſible memberſhip? Yes; the open Revelations of God as to a viſible perſon: You confeſs before as much as I need. 3. The eſſentiating qualification of a Church-member, is <hi>Covenant-conſent,</hi> ſuch as God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſe of his offered Covenant will accept as ſuch: But Infants have this Covenant-conſent, ſeeing they conſent by their Parents who are entruſted to do it for them, as if they were parts of themſelves: As the Jews Infants did. Mutual conſent of God and themſelves by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is it that maketh them members. I have oft wondered to read in orthodox Divines, that the Word purely preached, Sacraments and Diſcipline, are the marks of the true Church. No doubt but <hi>Heart-conſent to the Baptiſmal Covenant of Grace</hi> maketh a ſincere member of the true Church (which the Infant doth by the Parent,) and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed conſent</hi> to the ſame Covenant maketh a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible member (which regularly muſt be by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm for inveſtiture.) But a true Church may long by perſecution be hindred from publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, Preaching, Sacraments and Diſcipline; And may have much corruption in all theſe.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. You profeſs your ſelf that the name [Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Church-member] are equivocal as to the ſincere and the hypocrites: If they be not the ſame things, no wonder if they have not the ſame cauſes. That <hi>Donation</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> may be the ſole neareſt Inſtrumental efficient of True memberſhip, and yet not of Equivocal.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. God who is our Paternal Beneficient Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler doth give ſome of his benefits by his Law or Covenant abſolutely and antecedently to mans conditions, and ſome conſequently as Rewards: And Gods Laws having firſt a Preceptive part, as well as a Donative or Premiant, a Right may accrue in <hi>foro eccleſiae</hi> to an hypocrite from that precept: As <hi>e. g.</hi> God antecedently doth by his Covenant give the world an Impunity as to the puniſhment of Drowning it: And ſo by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of Grace he giveth the world many common mercies by a Redeemer, and perhaps many by that you call a phyſical act, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. And by his Law he (having given a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional pardon and life to all) commandeth his Miniſters to offer it, and All men to Accept it,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48465:97"/>
and his Miniſters to judge by mens profeſſion, and to uſe profeſſed Accepters as real; becauſe we cannot ſee the heart. This being ſo, when the hypocrite profeſſeth his conſent, the Law obligeth the Miniſter and Church to receive it, by which <hi>in foro eccleſiae</hi> he hath a right to his Church ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And Chriſt himſelf called <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſent him out to Preach, and his mandates were as Laws. So that the Right that an hypocrite hath, he hath by the Law which obligeth the Church to uſe him as a true believer, upon his profeſſing to be ſuch. None of this can be denyed. But <hi>Judas</hi> was called immediately by Chriſt himſelf; and his [<hi>follow me</hi>] was a precept which gave him a Right to his Relation.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. 1. IT is a thing that all are not duely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of, <hi>How far Controverſial Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Diſputes are to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by pious and peaceable men?</hi> And here (as in almoſt all things elſe) men are hardly cured of <hi>one extream</hi> but by <hi>another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. No doubt but the extream which hath far moſt injured the Church of Chriſt, hath been the <hi>exceſs of Diſputing</hi>; and given juſt occaſion to Sr. <hi>H.W.</hi>'s motto, [<hi>The Itch of Diſputing makes the Scab of the Church,</hi>] which is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, both in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and the <hi>Effects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. 1. In the <hi>cauſe</hi> it is too notorious, that ordinarily it proceedeth from the depravation of the three faculties of the ſoul, <hi>Poteſtative, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective, Volitive,</hi> in the three great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48465:101"/>
of iniquity, <hi>Pride, Ignorance</hi> and <hi>wrath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. 1. Did not <hi>Pride</hi> cauſe men much to <hi>overvalue</hi> their <hi>own parts</hi> and <hi>worth,</hi> Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie would have ſhrunk into a narrower compaſs before this day: Men would have come to one another as <hi>friends to be informed</hi> of what they know not, by enquiry and gentle conferences, if not as children to School, to learn: And if grace by hard ſtudies had given one man more inſight into any matters than another, humility would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have acknowledged Gods gifts, and deſired to have the benefit of a friendly communication; and whereever God had ſet up a <hi>light,</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his family would have been ready to work by it: It would not have been ſo hard as now it is for an Ignorant man to <hi>know</hi> his <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> nor to diſcern when another knoweth more than he.</p>
                     <p n="4">§. 4. But now, alas, a multitude that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not half their Catechiſm hear their Teachers as Maſters hear their Scholars, to know whether they ſay their leſſon well or not: And the Preacher that ſaith as they would have him, may paſs for orthodox at leaſt, if not for a very wiſe man, becauſe he is, ſo far, as wiſe as they: But if he will preſume to teach them more than they know, they ſuſpect him of hereſie, and the repetition of his Sermon which they make, is to mangle ſome ſentences which they had not wit enough to underſtand, and thence to proclaim (or whiſper abroad at leaſt) that the Preacher hath ſome dangerous errors, (and doth not know ſo much as they;) unleſs it be ſome luſcious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſom
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48465:101"/>
notions that he offereth them, or be a militant wrangler and would liſt them under him as his troop, to ſerve him in ſome new raiſed war, and then corrupt nature can magnifie <hi>novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> as if they were new revelations from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p n="5">§. 5. And O that the <hi>Teachers</hi> wanted not the ſenſe of their intellectual imperfections, as well as the people! But too many think that when they are all <hi>ordained</hi> into the <hi>ſame office,</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſame office is equally due to them all, and conſequently all that honour of <hi>Knowledge, Parts</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> without which the honour of the office cannot be well kept up. And ſo when they all walk in the ſame <hi>robes</hi> and are called by the ſame titles, matters which they never underſtood, muſt paſs according to the major vote, or at leaſt, they muſt not be contradicted, nor their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made known: And therefore when they have <hi>owned</hi> or <hi>uttered</hi> a Doctrine or Sentence, their honour is engaged to make it good; And they find a far eaſier way to make oſtentation of the Knowledge which they have not, by robes, titles and big words, than to macerate their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by imploying their minds in ſerious long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied ſtudies, till they have received into their minds the well digeſted frame of ſacred truths.</p>
                     <p n="6">§. 6. And if this tribe can keep the major vote (as it muſt be a ſtrangely happy country where they do not) whoever will be wiſer than they, ſhall be a heretick. But if it fall out better, and they be the <hi>weaker part,</hi> they will make up their honour by the way of <hi>ſingularity</hi> among ſo many as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48465:102"/>
they can get to believe, that they are maſters of ſome excellent truths which almoſt all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world is unacquainted with.</p>
                     <p n="7">§. 7. And even in men otherwiſe truly pious, there is ſo much <hi>remaining pride</hi> as is greatly gratified by <hi>ſingularity: Selfiſhneſs</hi> and the <hi>Old man</hi> are but <hi>One.</hi> And an opinion that is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly <hi>their own,</hi> is as lovely to them, as their own Children in compariſon of others: If they can ſay, <hi>ego primus inveni,</hi> it is ſweeteſt: If not, yet to be one of a ſingular Society, that is ſuppoſed wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and better and more excellent in their way of worſhip than all others, is very comfortable to them, that by taking the elect to be fewer than they are, do judge it a good mark to hold what few hold, and do as few do.</p>
                     <p n="8">§. 8. And there may be a <hi>conjunction of good and evil</hi> in the <hi>cauſe</hi> of theſe effects.</p>
                     <p>And from hence we now live among many that fall into various kinds of Sects, and every one hopeth for the comforts of <hi>ſingularity</hi> in their way. Many turn Quakers, becauſe they are <hi>ſingular</hi> in their auſterities: And many Congregations will not endure the ſinging of Gods Praiſe in Pſalms, at leaſt in <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms; and ſome will not have the Scriptures read, and ſome are againſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning and ſtudies, and ſome againſt Preaching upon a Text, and Praying before and after Sermon, and ſome againſt ordinary Family-worſhip, and many ſtartle if they hear the Creed, the Lords-Prayer and Commandments; and hence alſo the Doctrine of denying all Chriſtians In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Church-memberſhip hath proſpered.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48465:102"/>§. 9. And too many honeſt perſons in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ungodlineſs, are diſaffected to lawful and laudable things in the worſhip of God meerly becauſe the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly</hi> uſe them: When as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience telleth all the world, that they that have no Religion in ſincerity, will uſually joyn with the Religion that is uppermoſt; And ſo if good Rulers and Teachers ſet up that which is beſt, the beſt will be outwardly the way of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and if we muſt needs be ſingular from them we muſt take the worſt, and leave them the beſt: to their ſelf deceit and our ſhame.</p>
                     <p n="10">§ 10. I have thought by this weakneſs of ſome ſingular people, that, if God ſhould but let us have a King and other Rulers that were Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, and againſt Infant Baptiſm, and againſt ſinging Pſalms, and againſt the uſe of the Creed and Lords Prayer, and ſuch other things, and withal were themſelves of wicked lives, and would make Laws for their own way, and impoſe it on the people, ſo that the ungodly multitude did fall into this way, it would preſently cure moſt that are now for ſuch opinions: And though the Godly and the <hi>wicked</hi> muſt be greatly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced in the Church, yet before we are aware, our ſecret <hi>Pride</hi> ſets in with this deſire of diſcipline, and maketh us much deſire to ſeem <hi>eminently Good,</hi> by a more notable and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous difference from the common ſort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians than God in Scripture or reaſon doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And how much <hi>Ignorance</hi> hath to do in all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48465:103"/>
our controverſies, would ſoon be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if the queſtion concerned not our ſelves: For every diſputer accuſeth his <hi>adverſary</hi> of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:</hi> If they be of ten minds (inconſiſtent) nine of them muſt needs be erroneous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and yet every one chargeth it on the reſt, and thinks that he alone is free. Alas, that mans ſoul, which here muſt act in ſuch a puddle of brains, and in ſo frail a receptive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine as it here uſeth, ſhould have ſuch high and confident thoughts of its own untryed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted conceptions that will not let Ignorance be acknowledged or cured! Moſt certainly we are all ſo dark and weak, that it is but a <hi>few Great neceſſary</hi> things, or ſuch as are very <hi>plain,</hi> which we have cauſe to be confident of, without all ſuſpicion of miſtake. Moſt certainly <hi>natural dulneſs,</hi> or ſhort and ſuperficial ſtudies, through ſloth or diverſions, or want of right teachers, or an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reception of wrong methods or opinions, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto more, and many ſuch cauſes, doth and will keep not only moſt Chriſtians, but moſt Teachers of the Church in ſo low a meaſure of Knowledge, as unfitteth them to maſter and manage very difficult controverſies: And yet ſad experience telleth us, that he that is leaſt able to ſpeak, is oft leaſt able to hold his tongue; And it's too rare to find a man that is not Ignorant of his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that chargeth not him with Pride that will preſume to contradict him. What wonder then if diſputes be endleſs?</p>
                     <p n="12">§. 12. 3. And that <hi>wrath</hi> is in the cauſe needs no proof but experience, while we ſee men come
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48465:103"/>
forth with militant diſpoſitions, and animoſity is their valour, and how to make their adverſaries ſeem contemptible or odious is their work.</p>
                     <p n="13">§. 13. 2. And if I ſhould but open to you the Diſputing evil, in the <hi>effects</hi> as I have done in the <hi>Cauſes,</hi> what a woful tragedy, of 1500 years duration, ſhould I preſent you with? But I ſhall put off that part of the work, ſuppoſing that ſight and experience do inform you more effectually than words can do.</p>
                     <p n="14">§. 14. On all theſe accounts I ſtill ſay as <hi>Paul, The ſervant of the Lord muſt not</hi> (need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly) <hi>ſtrive,</hi> nor meddle with thoſe wranglings which <hi>miniſter Queſtions rather than godly edifying which is in faith: For the end of the Commandment is Love out of a pure heart, and a good Conſcience and faith unfeigned:</hi> And the high pretenders are too often [<hi>proud, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing,</hi> but <hi>doting about queſtions</hi> and <hi>ſtrifes</hi> of <hi>words; whereof cometh envy, ſtrife, railing, evil ſurmiſing, perverſe diſputings of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds and deſtitute of the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">§. 15. II. But yet for all this, as Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans uſe to tell Tyrants, that if God and man did but ſecure them from all reſiſtance, men would flie from them as from Tigers or Crocodiles, and ſuppoſe their boundleſs uncontrouled pride and cruelty would be inſatiable; ſo I ſay of Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and truly Schiſmatical Contenders, that If they were once ſecured that whatever folly, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or ungodly miſchievous conceits they vend, and that with the greateſt induſtry and turbulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48465:104"/>
to deceive the people, no man yet muſt contradict them, nor open their folly that it may be known to all, and go no further, for fear of being taken for a man of diſputation, controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſtrife, this would ſo embolden them to attempt the ſeduction of all ſorts of people, that no place would be ſafe or quiet.</p>
                     <p n="16">§. 16. It is a fooliſh pretence of peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and quietneſs, to ſtand by in ſilence for fear of our own or others trouble, and ſee well-meaning people ſeduced, Chriſt and his truth and name abuſed, and God diſhonoured, and his Churches ſhaken, and made a ſcorn and ſcandal to the world, and all for fear of being accounted contentious. If it be lukewarm (as they ſay themſelves) to hear dayly ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, curſers, ſcorners, and ſuch other prophane ſinners, and not give them a cloſe reproof or admonition, ſo much more is it to ſee or hear hurtful falſhoods publiſhed as the precious truths of God, and not to contradict it, nor endeavour to ſave mens ſouls from the infection. If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans work muſt be done without reſiſtance as oft as a miſtaken well-meaning man will do it, there will be little ſafety for the flocks.</p>
                     <p n="17">§. 17. When <hi>Paul</hi> fore-told the <hi>Epheſians</hi> of two ſorts that would aſſault them, <hi>viz. Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous devouring wolves,</hi> and <hi>men ariſing among themſelves that would ſpeak perverſe things to draw away diſciples after them,</hi> his concluſion is [<hi>Therefore watch</hi>]: And what that watching is he tells <hi>Timothy, The mouths</hi> of ſuch <hi>deceivers</hi> muſt be <hi>ſtopped:</hi> not by <hi>force,</hi> for that <hi>Timothy</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48465:104"/>
had no power to do; but by <hi>evident truth.</hi> And <hi>Truth</hi> hath a <hi>power</hi> in its <hi>evidence,</hi> if it be but rightly opened and managed. And were it not that God in all ages had enabled ſome of his ſervants, faithfully and clearly to vindicate truth, and defend ſound doctrine, and hold faſt the form of wholeſome words, and ſtop the mouth of <hi>ignorant pride</hi> that wrangleth againſt them, what had become of us long agoe? And though ill diſputes have done much miſchief, and too often diſputing ſuccedeth more according to the <hi>Parts, intereſts</hi> or advantages of the Diſputers, than according to the evidence of truth: Yet for all ſuch abuſes, Truth muſt be defended, and it find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſomething even in nature (as bad as man is) to befriend it; few love a plain falſhood, unleſs where intereſt greatly bribeth them: And upon tryal Truth will at laſt prevail, where ſin doth not provoke God in judgement to leave men to the deluſions which they chuſe.</p>
                     <p n="18">§. 18. If then the way be to <hi>Teach and Learn,</hi> and quietly open the <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> and in <hi>meekneſs to inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and to avoid contentions as we avoid <hi>wars,</hi> till other mens aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ignorant, idle, fleſhly droans, that eat and drink and mind the world, but meddle not much with controverſies. 3. Profeſſors of Religious zeal, who eſpouſe ſome ſingular dividing way, and turn all their ſtudies to make good their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes; who have laudable abilities perverted by prejudice, error and intereſt. 4. Honeſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that ſerve God in practical preaching; but being but <hi>half ſtudied</hi> in ſome controverſies, are yet as forward and buſie in diſputing, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and reproving diſſenters, as if they knew as much as the cauſe requireth. I would all theſe would meddle with no controverſies, but what great neceſſity in plain and certain caſes calls them to. 5. We have many humble truly God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, who as they are conſcious that they are not well ſtudied for controverſie, ſo they meddle not with it but lay out themſelves in preaching the truths that we all agree in, and do God and his Church much ſervice in quietneſs and peace: Theſe are the men that the Church is moſt beholden to. 6. Some are judicious and very fit for controverſie, but too cold in the practical part of Religion. 7. Some excellent holy men (like <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) have ſo digeſted the matter, as to be able to defend the truth againſt all adverſaries and live accordingly. Only theſe two laſt ſorts ſhould be imployed in ſuch diſputes.</p>

                     <head>SECT. II. Of the weight and nature of the preſent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</head>
                     <p n="1">§. 1. I think it a matter in this diſtracted age, which you may be much concerned in, to know what weight is to be laid on the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about Infant Baptiſm that you may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come too ſhort nor go too far. For my part, when the Chriſtian Parent (or owner) to whom God in Nature and Scripture hath intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Infant, doth heartily dedicate him to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that he ſtand related according to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant, I am none of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God who is a Spirit, layeth ſo much upon the application of the water, as to damn any ſuch Infant meerly for the want of it. And though I cannot ſubſcribe to as much more, as ſome would have me (who think ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their own underſtandings than ever any evidence perſwaded me to do, as to judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy to be Creed-makers for all others, yea and to be called <hi>The Church it ſelf,</hi>) yet I approve of the ſeventeenth Canon of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Dort Art.</hi> 1. that [<hi>faithful Parents have no cauſe to doubt of the ſalvation of their children dying in Infancy.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. And I hope all the pious <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> themſelves do virtually though not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48465:107"/>
devote their children to God, and conſent to their Covenant relation, while they vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead againſt it. For ſurely they have ſo much natural affection, that if they did think that God would be a God in ſpecial Covenant with their children, and pardon their Original ſin, and give them right to future life, upon the Parents dedication and conſent, they would undoubtedly accept the gift, and be thankful? And I believe moſt of them would ſay, [<hi>I would do all that God intruſteth and enableth me to do, that my child may be a child of God, and I would give him up to God and accept any mercy for him as far as God doth authorize me ſo to do.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. And if Parents and Owners will not conſent that their children be in Covenant with God and be baptized, I am not yet ſatisfied what remedy we have, nor who can do it for them to as good effect. For if <hi>any one may do it,</hi> as ſome plead, then all Heathens children may be ſo uſed and ſaved: And he that perſwadeth me that there is extant ſuch a Covenant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God that he will ſave every Heathens child that is but by any one brought to baptiſm, 1. He muſt ſhew me that text where this promiſe is. 2. And when he hath done, he will leave me perſwaded that God will ſave all Heathens Infants whether baptized or not. 1. Becauſe I and ten thouſand more Chriſtians would ſit in our cloſets and offer to God all the Infants in the world; that is, conſent that he be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled God, and they his children and in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him: what good man would not deſire
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48465:108"/>
their ſalvation? 2. And I ſhould not eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God will damn them all meerly for want of a <hi>ſtrangers</hi> conſent to ſave them, were that wanting. 3. Much leſs that when <hi>we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a thouſand or ten thouſand miles off,</hi> that all the children <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Siana</hi> ſhall be baptized and ſaved, that this ſhall not hinder their damnation meerly becauſe the Infants and we are ſo diſtant that we cannot in <hi>ſight and preſence</hi> offer them to God: ſurely if my conſent that a <hi>Turks</hi> child be baptized and ſaved will do it if he were with me, it may do it a mile off: and if ſo, then ten thouſand miles off. 4. And if I be impowred to <hi>conſent,</hi> I ſhall never believe that the bare want of the <hi>water</hi> will damn him, who hath all things elſe that God hath made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his ſalvation (as I ſaid before.) I think they give too much to Baptiſm, who ſay that God will either ſave any one by it, who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth other things neceſſary to ſalvation, or that he will damn any for want of it (that is, of the waſhing of the body) who want nothing elſe which is neceſſary to ſalvation. And I doubt they that ſay otherwiſe will prove diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourers of the Chriſtian Religion, by feigning it to be too like to the Heatheniſh ſuperſtition, laying mens ſalvation on a ceremony as of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: And I am confident it is contrary to Chriſts redoubled leſſon, <hi>Go learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice:</hi> And no men ſhall unteach me this great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable leſſon, which Chriſt hath ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taught me, and which hath been long writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48465:108"/>
ſo deeply on my heart, as hath made all <hi>unmerciful perſecutions</hi> and <hi>ſeparations,</hi> and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enations very diſpleaſing to me.</p>
                     <p n="4">§. 4. I have proved afterwards that even <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf doth as on great deliberation aſſert that where the Miniſtry of baptiſm is not deſpiſed, Heart <hi>converſion</hi> without it ſufficeth to ſalvation in the adult: And no ſcripture or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth make it <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Infants,</hi> if <hi>not to the adult.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">§. 5. And if Heathens Infants are not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned meerly for want of outward baptiſm, nor yet for want of the <hi>conſent</hi> of others (either becauſe that other mens conſent who are ſtrangers to them is not neceſſary to their ſalvation, or if it be neceſſary they have it at a diſtance) then it will follow that all the Infants of Heathens are in a ſtate of ſalvation, unleſs ſomewhat elſe be yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neceſſary to it: And if they are all ſaved, then ſo are all Chriſtians Infants alſo, or elſe they are more miſerable than Heathens. And if you can firſt believe that the Infants of all Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Atheiſts, and ungodly Chriſtians (hypocrites) have a promiſe of ſalvation, you will next be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined</hi> to think better of their Parents ſtate than God alloweth you: And where is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</p>
                     <p n="6">§. 6. Some ſay that the new Covenant gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth grace and life to all that do not <hi>ponere obicem.</hi> But I muſt have Gods Covenant in his own <hi>terms,</hi> that I may have it in his own <hi>ſenſe,</hi> if I will be aſſured of the <hi>benefits. Non ponere obicem</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth plainly <hi>no Action</hi> or <hi>poſitive qualification</hi>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:48465:109"/>
as neceſſary, but only a <hi>negation</hi> of ſome contrary action: And it is certain that the terms of Gods Covenant to the adult are clean contrary; It is not he <hi>that neither Believeth nor oppoſeth faith ſhall be ſaved,</hi> or he <hi>that doth neither good nor harm,</hi> as a man in an apoplexy, or aſleep: But [<hi>he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned</hi>; And <hi>except ye repent ye ſhall all periſh</hi>; And <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs none ſhall ſee God:</hi>] But a meer <hi>negation</hi> is no <hi>holineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">§. 7. And if any will feign <hi>another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> for <hi>Infants,</hi> let him ſhew what and where it is; for I know but <hi>one Covenant of grace,</hi> which taketh in the <hi>Infants</hi> with the <hi>Authorized Parents,</hi> whoſe <hi>members</hi> or <hi>Own</hi> God taketh them to be, and <hi>requireth</hi> a <hi>poſitive believing conſent</hi> and <hi>dedication</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>poſitive condition:</hi> which is more than a <hi>Negative (non ponere obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi>) though performed by <hi>the Parent for the child:</hi> And ſo the promiſes throughout the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture run to the <hi>faithful and their ſeed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">§. 8. I know that God promiſeth to bleſs children <hi>through many generations,</hi> for their faithful Anceſtors ſake: But that is on ſuppoſition that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity continue in the line, and that apoſtaſie make no interciſion. Elſe all ſhould be bleſſed for the ſake of <hi>Noe,</hi> even <hi>Cham</hi>'s poſterity as well as <hi>Shem</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p n="9">§. 9. What then is the thing made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (and ſufficient) by the Covenant to their ſalvation, but that they be the <hi>ſeed of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful devoted by them to God,</hi> that is, that their
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48465:109"/>
                        <hi>Parents natural,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>civil,</hi> whoſe <hi>Own</hi> they are, and have the power of diſpoſing of them for their good, do enter them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent into the Covenant with Chriſt? which it is ſuppoſed that <hi>Faithful Parents virtually</hi> did before, and will <hi>actually</hi> do when God doth call them to it.</p>
                     <p n="10">§. 10. As to them that ſay, [the <hi>thing further neceſſary</hi> as the <hi>condition of the</hi> Infants acceptance and ſalvation is [<hi>A promiſe to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Child as a Chriſtian if he live</hi>] I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. That promiſe indeed is included in his dedication and conſent; 2. But who but the <hi>Owners</hi> of the <hi>child</hi> are capable of making ſuch a promiſe? (unleſs as ſeconds promiſing that the Owners ſhall do their duty): For only he that <hi>owneth him</hi> can educate him (by himſelf or others) or <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of him for his education: who hath power to diſpoſe of another mans child, and educate him? They that undertake as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to do it, in caſe the <hi>Parents apoſtatize</hi> or <hi>die,</hi> do plainly imply, 1. That <hi>till then</hi> it is the <hi>Parent</hi> that is <hi>intruſted</hi> to do it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Parent muſt <hi>conſent</hi> to do it; and therefore that the Parent muſt enter his child in the Covenant of Chriſt: 2. And that if the Parents <hi>apoſtatize</hi> or <hi>die,</hi> they will take the child themſelves as <hi>their Own</hi>; or elſe by what power can they educate him or diſpoſe of him?</p>
                     <p n="11">§. 11. They that ſay, God did not ſave one for the faith or conſent of another; muſt remember, 1. That we are all ſaved for the <hi>meritorious
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48465:110"/>
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> by the way of a <hi>free gift,</hi> whoſe condition is but <hi>ſuitable acceptance:</hi> And why may not a Parent <hi>accept a donation for his Child,</hi> who hath no will to accept it for himſelf? Shall he be <hi>certainly</hi> ſhut out unto dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Or ſhall <hi>he</hi> have that gift <hi>abſolutely</hi> which is <hi>conditional</hi> to all <hi>others?</hi> Or is he not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the donation at all? 2. And remember that we have guilt and miſery from our Parents; and therefore though life and pardon be by Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet it is congruous that the meer condition of acceptance may be performed by the Parents.</p>
                     <p n="12">§. 12. Perhaps ſome will lay all the right of Infants to the pardon of ſin, and ſalvation, upon ſecret election only; as if all that we knew of Infants Salvation were that God will ſave ſome whom he hath elected: but that there is no Promiſe of grace and ſalvation to any particular Infant in the world, as under any condition or qualification: And if this be ſo, then, 1. No In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant hath any <hi>Right</hi> to pardon, grace and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, given him by the Covenant of Grace; No more than any elect perſon at age hath before faith and regeneration: Election gave <hi>Paul</hi> (nor any wicked man) no right to pardon or ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Elſe elect Pagans and Infidels are juſtified; if they have <hi>jus ad impunitatem &amp; Regnum Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</hi> 2. And if this be ſo, we have no aſſurance that God will ſave ten or three Infants in all the world: For he hath not told us whether he hath elected ſo many. 3. And yet we cannot be ſure but that they may all or almoſt all be ſaved, while the number of the elect is unrevealed.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48465:110"/>
4. Nor can we know that any more of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Faithful are ſaved, than of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens or Infidels; of thoſe that love God and keep his Commandments, than of thoſe that hate him. 5. And, in a word, we have then no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hope,</hi> upon <hi>Covenant right,</hi> that God will ſave any one individual Infant in the world: For we can <hi>hope</hi> (in this proper ſenſe) of nothing but what we do <hi>believe,</hi> and we can <hi>believe</hi> nothing but what is <hi>promiſed</hi> or revealed. And ſo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents muſt be thus far hopeleſs.</p>
                     <p n="13">§. 13. God who made man after his Image, teacheth him to govern according to thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which are his Image: And all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in this world take Infants for Infant-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and the Laws give them Right to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Inheritances, the poſſeſſion and uſe whereof they may have in the time and degrees that nature doth capacitate them. And can we then think that God who made a Conditional Gift of Pardon and Salvation to all the adult perſons in the world, did wholly leave out In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and that his Covenant giveth them no rights at all; no not to be members of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church?</p>
                     <p n="14">§. 14. It ſeemeth to me a matter of doubtful conſequence to aſſert, that God will ſave more (yea ſo great numbers as we will hope are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Infancie) than ever he promiſed to ſave, and gave any antecedent Right to Salvation to? I doubt we ſhall open ſuch a gap to the hopes of preſumptuous Heathens and Infidels this way, as will croſs our common doctrine: If God may
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48465:111"/>
ſave whole Kingdoms and millions of Heathens Infants to whom he never gave Right to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any gift or promiſe, meerly becauſe he elected them; ſome will ſay, why may he not do ſo alſo by the Parents; at leaſt renewing them all <hi>in tranſitu</hi>?</p>
                     <p n="15">§. 15. If you ſay that <hi>He giveth them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his ſanctifying grace, and giveth them right to Salvation as ſanctified, though he tell us not who are ſanctified,</hi> I anſwer, 1. Take heed leſt you teach the preſumptuous to ſay the ſame of Infidels, Heathens and almoſt all, that God may in the paſſages when they are dying ſanctifie and ſave them all. 2. Still this giveth no poſitive hope of any particulars, nor more to Chriſtians for their Children than they may have of the Children of Infidels; nor any promiſe of the ſpirit and ſanctification, as Believers have.</p>
                     <p n="16">§. 16. I take it therefore for the ſoundeſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that Gods taking the Children of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful into Covenant with him, and becoming their God and taking them for his own, doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no leſs than a ſtate of Grace, and pardon and right to life eternal; and that they are in this ſtate upon their Parents <hi>Conſent and Heart-devoting them to God in Chriſt,</hi> before baptiſm, but baptiſm is the ſolemnizing and inveſtiture, which openly <hi>coram Eccleſia</hi> delivereth them <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of their viſible Church-ſtate with a ſealed pardon and gift of life: For it is not another, but the ſame promiſe and Covenant which is made to the faithful and their feed: And all Gods promiſes to the many Generations of them, in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48465:111"/>
the ſecond Commandment and many other Texts, cannot mean any ſuch little bleſſings as conſiſt with a ſtate of damnation and the poſſeſſion of the Devil. And all the ancient Churches in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Infants were of this mind (whom I will not deſpiſe.) And <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe perſwadeth me that the Children of Natural and Civil Parents (truly their Owners) have this right (before they are baptized.) But the former (natural Parents) have plainer evidence than the later (which is a darker caſe.) But as for them that think either that all Infants are ſaved, or all baptized Infants (<hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ure vel injuria</hi>) though no <hi>Parent</hi> or <hi>Owner conſent</hi> or <hi>dedicate them (heartily, or openly) to God,</hi> or though they are hypocrites and truly conſent not for themſelves or theirs, let them prove it if they can; but I muſt ſay it is paſt my power.</p>
                     <p n="17">§. 17. I know the grand difficulty is, that then this <hi>Infant-Grace is loſt</hi> in many that live to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age. I have ſaid ſo much of this in my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Directory that I will refer the conſidering Reader thither, only adding, 1. That far greater abſurdities will follow the contrary opinion, and the <hi>greater are</hi> not to be choſen. I am loth again to name them. 2. That the univerſal Church (as far as by any notice we can know) did for many hundred years grant the concluſion and take it for no abſurdity, but a certain truth; yea much more, <hi>Auſtin</hi> and his followers themſelves, thought more at age were truly juſtified and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified than were elected and did perſevere: And ſome hold that not all that have the ſanctifying
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48465:112"/>
ſpirit, but only certain confirmed Chriſtians, have a certainty to perſevere: And others hold, that as the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is promiſed to Believers, though men believe not without the ſpirit, ſo that meaſure of Grace which cauſeth men <hi>only to believe,</hi> as antecedent to that <hi>promiſed ſpirit (of Power, Love and a ſound mind)</hi> is but ſuch as may be loſt, as <hi>Adams</hi> was; and that it is the <hi>ſpirit following it</hi> (as the rooted habit) which cannot be loſt: And others come yet lower, and ſay that the Grace which giveth <hi>faith it ſelf</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loſt (becauſe ſuch have the promiſe of the ſpirit;) but yet the grace which only <hi>enableth men to Repent and Believe</hi> (called <hi>ſufficient</hi>) may be loſt before it produce the Act: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſome think of Infant-Grace: The laſt ſort think that they have real pardon of original ſin and right to life, and have <hi>real Grace</hi>; but being Infants, that grace is but ſuch as <hi>will enable them to believe if they come to age,</hi> and not <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly cauſe it,</hi> and that <hi>this may be loſt:</hi> And ſo I might run over the opinions of the reſt. And among all theſe the judgement of <hi>Davenant, Ward,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>loſs of an Infant-ſtate of Grace,</hi> as by them opened is not ſo hard, as I think the contrary way will infer: And it ſeems by <hi>Art.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17. that the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> was of their mind.</p>
                     <p n="18">§. 18. Our darkneſs about the <hi>future ſtate</hi> of <hi>Infants Souls,</hi> hath occaſioned ſome diverſity of thoughts about their <hi>preſent ſtate.</hi> Indeed they will neither in Heaven or Hell have any work for <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the <hi>review</hi> of any <hi>former actions,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48465:112"/>
good or evil:</hi> And it ſeemeth by <hi>Nazianzene</hi> before cited (<hi>Orat.</hi> 40.) that ſome Ancients thought as moſt Papiſts do, that unbaptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have neither the joys of Heaven, nor any puniſhment but the loſs of theſe: But what ſtate then to place them in they know not: To think that they ſhall remain in a meer potentiality of underſtanding, and ſhall know no more than they did here, is to equal them with bruits, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Socinians who ſay the like of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated ſouls of the adult: And if they can allow <hi>underſtanding</hi> to thoſe that <hi>died baptized,</hi> why not to the <hi>reſt?</hi> And if they <hi>underſtand,</hi> they muſt have <hi>grief</hi> or <hi>pleaſure:</hi> But who can know more than God revealeth?</p>
                     <p n="19">§. 19. In ſum; 1. That God would have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents devote their Children to him, and enter them according to their capacity in his Covenant (as I have elſewhere proved) is a great truth, not to be forſaken. 2. And alſo that he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into his Covenant all that are faithfully thus devoted to him, and is peculiarly their God, and ſuch Children are holy. 3. That they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly members according to an Infant capacity of the viſible Church as they are of all Kingdoms under Heaven: Theſe are all clear and great truths. 4. And that there is far more hope of their ſalvation than of thoſe without. 5. And I think the Covenant maketh their Salvation cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain if they ſo die. 6. And it ſeemeth to me that the <hi>inveſtiture</hi> and <hi>ſolemnization</hi> of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Chriſt, ſhould be made in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. and the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of the univerſal Church. 7. But if any ſhould think with <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Nazianzene</hi> that the time of <hi>inveſtiture</hi> and <hi>ſolemnization</hi> is partly left to prudence, and may be delayed in caſe of health, yea or ſhould think that Infants are not to be ſolemnly inveſted by baptiſm, but only the adult, ſo they confeſs <hi>Infants relation to God, his Covenant and Church</hi>; I would differ from ſuch men with love and peace, and mutual tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and communion.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. The Occaſion of this Writing.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. AS I was by great and long importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unwillingly engaged at firſt to meddle publickly in the Controverſie of Infant Baptiſm with Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> ſo I then reſolved to meddle no more with it, unleſs I found that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity made it an apparent duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. Accordingly when Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> had print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laſt private papers which paſt between him and me, without my conſent, I never anſwered his reply to this day; not ſtriving to have the laſt word, and ſuppoſing that the ſtudious impartial Reader, would find no need of a rejoynder: For to me his Reply ſeemed ſo empty and next no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that I thought it unneceſſary to ſay any more.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. But it is now grown the cuſtom among Papiſts and Sectaries and almoſt all the wranglers that trouble the world, to ſcribble ſomewhat ſenſe or nonſenſe againſt that truth which they have not wit, or will, or humility enough to learn, and then ſay to thoſe that would make them wiſer, <hi>you are anſwered</hi>; and it goeth for a victory to any foolery, if they can but ſay, <hi>ſuch a one that hath written againſt you is unanſwered</hi>: As if we dealt on ſuch terms with the world in writing, as that he that ſpeaketh laſt, (that is, that liveth longeſt) muſt be ſuppoſed to be in the right. Or as if we knew not when we write againſt the groſſeſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48465:114"/>
hereſie or error, that as many words may be ſaid or written for it as againſt it!</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. And O what pity is it that with the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſort of well-meaning people, <hi>number</hi> goeth for <hi>weight,</hi> and he ſeemeth to be in the right to them, who is <hi>neareſt</hi> them and hath <hi>beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> to talk to them a few ſmooth deceitful words for his opinion, and to belie and vilifie thoſe that are againſt him! Not but that there are great fundamental Truths which manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which I hope theſe honeſt ſouls would not be drawn from by an Angel from Heaven: But verily no true Charity can be ſo blind as to deny it, that in lower controverted points, the knowledge of the vulgar Religious people is ſo low, that he that is lower than an Angel, or than a well-ſtudied Divine, or than a man of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſolid reaſon, may deceive them (having firſt been himſelf deceived) if he can but ſpeak <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> others <hi>impudently,</hi> by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>deſcribed</hi> and <hi>exorciſed</hi> in <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. at large.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. And I crave thy pity, Reader, to my ſelf and ſuch as I, that our <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is ſo much at the will and mercy of ſuch a ſort of wrangling men. That if I have it in my deſire to do Gods Church ſervice upon ſome greater and more needful ſubject, yet it is in the power of the Devil to ſtir up the corruption of honeſt well-meaning Chriſtians, to put a neceſſity on me to do ſome poor inconſiderable works, and leave undone the greater and more excellent.</p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. For circumſtances may make it a mans duty to do that as <hi>preſently neceſſary,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48465:114"/>
a few years will be of no ſignification, but die with the intereſts and quarrels of the age.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. It hath pleaſed the Lord, who did let looſe the Serpent upon <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Church in almoſt all ages with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from two ſorts that ſeem much contrary, but are nearer in diſpoſition and principles than they well underſtand themſelves, I mean <hi>Church-Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> and <hi>Church-Dividers</hi>; And though I (and moſt others of my quality) have ſuffered incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more by the former, yet it is not a little that I have ſuffered by the later: And eſpecially that by their ſlanderous and clamorous unquiet importunity, they will not give me leave to live by them in peace, nor to go on in better work while I meddle not with them. I could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that leave from Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi>; And now Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath been pleaſed to open the mouths of ſo many of his partakers againſt me, as maketh wiſe men tell me that to be ſilent will be to be ſcandalouſly guilty of their ſin. And do we live upon theſe terms, that any Railer can call us off from our better ſervices when ever He and Satan pleaſe?</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. But my purpoſe is to meddle with them but this once: And if after this theſe crying Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will bawl and wrangle and foul the houſe, and think that I am made for no better work than either to rock the Cradle or to make them clean, I will let them cry and take their courſe, and will no more believe that their humours are the maſters of my time.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:48465:115"/>§. 9. By three or four arguments (of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) it hath pleaſed one Major <hi>Danvers</hi> a Souldier to call me to this task. 1. By heaping up a Catalogue of Accuſations againſt my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in my Chriſtian Directory. 2. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching me for not anſwering Mr. <hi>Tombes.</hi> 3. By proclaiming me to the world a ſlanderer who owe the Anabaptiſts ſatisfaction, for ſaying that many of them were <hi>Baptized naked.</hi> 4. By perverſe citations of my later Writings as if they had been ſerviceable to his cauſe. 5. By his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to poor ſouls and the Churches peace, by his <hi>ignorant</hi> though <hi>confident</hi> oppoſition to the truth, and writing a Volume of he knoweth not what.</p>
                  <p n="10">§. 10. And to add to my invitation, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of late a common ſaying among the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, that I am turned to their opinion or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near it, but have not humility to retract my former error, and openly acknowledge what I hold.</p>
                  <p n="11">§. 11. The occaſion of this is, 1. Becauſe I have ſo many years forborn to anſwer Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his laſt. 2. Becauſe I ſeek peace with them, and ſpeak for it upon all occaſions, and ſeek to abate other mens over-great oppoſition to them. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon all occaſions I preſs the conſideration and improvement of our Baptiſm, taking it for the ſumm and Character of our Chriſtianity, and the true deſcription of Converſion, and the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial mark of Grace, and the qualification of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church-members, and the bond of all our Chriſtian duty: As if none but Anabaptiſts could think thus?</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:48465:115"/>§. 12. When I firſt read Major <hi>Danvers</hi> Book, I thought ſuch a Fardle could not be ſo regarded as to need an Anſwer; But when his Bookſeller came to know of me what I had againſt it, as from him; and when I heard how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them were Printed, I rather choſe to imitate him that had <hi>compaſſion on a headleſs mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> than him that ſaid, <hi>ſi populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</hi> And they that will not let me reſt, muſt bear ſome of the fruits of my diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. More of my Judgement of the Anabaptiſts and their Cauſe, with a motion to them for peace.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. I Confeſs that in my Book againſt Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> I wrote ſeveral pages enigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of the offenſive ſcandals of the Anabaptiſts: And they that now read them when the occaſion is forgotten or unknown, will either not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, or think them too ſharp. But in all military Controverſies, no man is ſo meet a Judge as he that is on the ground.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. I am almoſt ready to condemn my ſelf for that and many other things paſt when I forget the occaſion of them and the ſtate that we were in: But I will not deny that at that time my heart felt more than I expreſt, 1. When I heard Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtry obtruded on the religious people, as a great and needful part of their integrity: 2. And when they that abhorred to hear of old ſcandals were buſily making more and greater: 3. When I ſaw what was done againſt the Parliament, by them that profeſſed to be their ſervants, and that the Anabaptiſts and their Aſſociates were the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt in the work: 4. And what was done againſt the King, when they had thruſt out the Parliament; 5. And what was done in the wars againſt <hi>Scotland</hi>; 6. And what orders paſt for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring all ſuch as my ſelf that were not for their <hi>Engagement</hi> or <hi>Keeping</hi> their days of <hi>faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:48465:116"/>
and <hi>thanksgiving</hi> in cauſes of blood: 7. And when I ſaw theſe executed on many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men that were Maſters of Colledges in the Univerſities, and uſeful Miniſters in the Country: 8. And when I ſaw what that called the Little Parliament was and did, and how it was put to the Vote whether all the Pariſh Miniſters of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> ſhould be put out at once? and carried againſt them but by a few: And that the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts were of the forwardeſt in all this work: 9. And after when I ſaw how many of them turned Ranters, and read my ſelf ſome of their Letters, full of horrid Oathes and Blaſphemies; All theſe things made me think that they were not friends to the Churches welfare, and this was not the way of holineſs or peace.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. All this while I deſired to have lived by them in peace and quietneſs, but I could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> thought that I ſtood in the way of his ſucceſſes, even when I medled not with them. And therefore I muſt be either converted to them or conquered, that the triumph might promote their ends. And when that quarrel was over I was glad, and purpoſed to meddle with them no more.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. One of the greateſt things that offended me, was that (even in the Pariſhes where there were the ableſt faithful laborious Miniſters,) they laboured to gather ſeparated Churches, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their opinion; And when they had gathered them, they were militant Churches: Preſently that Town was in a war; and the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings employed for the extolling of their opinions,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48465:117"/>
and vilifying the Miniſters and Churches that were againſt them, and making them odious or contemptible to their followers: which could not be the work of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. I dare challenge any man to make it good, that ever I fought to perſecute any Anabaptiſts, or ſtirred up others to perſecute them for their judgements: I know not that ever I did any of them any harm, except by not being of their minds, or contradicting them.</p>
                  <p>But though my ſufferings by them were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, (that honour being aſſumed by another party) yet they have not carried it ſo to me: But have convinced me that were they uppermoſt they would then have had too little tenderneſs for thoſe that hindred their ſucceſſes: Even ſome of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his flock, my neighbours and familiar friends, I think, ſought my life or ruine when I meddled not with them. When Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> had done what was done in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> I wrote a Letter to Major <hi>Beak</hi> at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger telling them at <hi>Bewdley</hi> that he had a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from me, ſome of them made themſelves Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and in arms way-laid the meſſenger, aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and took his Letters, and though they found not what I ſuppoſe they expected, yet find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it but a great mans name, who then much ruled publick affairs, they ſent it up to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to him, who ſummoned Major <hi>Beak</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to anſwer it, who had never ſeen it and knew nothing of it: And though he ſo ſcaped, I was loudly threatned; but General <hi>Monks</hi> approach out of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtayed the execution of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48465:117"/>
Thus did my familiar Friends unprovo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (ſome of them yet alive).</p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. Indeed my judgement was and is, that the point of Infant Baptiſm hath its conſiderable difficulties, which may occaſion wiſe and good men to doubt, or to be miſtaken in it. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Roman party have taken it to be proveable only by the tradition and judgement of the Church: And Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> hath publickly intimated as if one of our moſt Learned and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire publick Profeſſors of Theologie in one of our Univerſities, had declared himſelf of the ſame mind, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not to be proved by Scripture, (Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath alſo made advantage of this teſtimony), (Though of late Scripture <hi>certain proof</hi> is found (in the new Rubrick of the Liturgie) for a great deal more.) I am not of that mind, that it is not proveable by Scripture. I think I have proved it: but not by evidence ſo clear, as every good man can perceive.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. Therefore I never took the point of it to have ſuch weight, as that all that differed from me in it, muſt be denied either <hi>Love, Liberty</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi> If I know my own heart I do as hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love a ſober godly man that is againſt Infant baptiſm, as I do ſuch men that differ from me in other ſuch Controverſies; and much better than one of my own judgement, who hath leſs piety and ſobriety. And I make no doubt but there are among us very many ſuch, even ſober and religious men, as there be among other parties.</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. Nor do I think that there is ſo much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48465:118"/>
in the bare opinion which denieth Infant Baptiſm, as that all the Anabaptiſts miſcarriages ſhould ariſe from the nature of that opinion. But I am paſt doubt that they ariſe from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed minds of many that hold it. When injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons lay hold upon an opinion which is not common, their ſingularity kindleth a proud ſelfiſh zeal, and they take that opinion as more peculiarly their own, than the common Articles which all Chriſtians hold: And therefore they grow fond of it, and are puft up thereby with a conceit of their extraordinary knowledge: And then they ſeem to themſelves more religious than others, and greater friends to the truth: And ſo <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> engage them in <hi>ſingularity</hi> and <hi>ſeparation:</hi> And thus they would do, were it any other opinion, which they thought as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of as this: So that it is not an Anabaptiſt as ſuch, but the <hi>proud Church-divider,</hi> or <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> that I am moſt offended at.</p>
                  <p n="9">§. 9. I know that in the Ancient Churches men were left at liberty, both <hi>when</hi> they would be baptized themſelves, and when their Children ſhould be baptized: And though Infant-baptiſm was without any known original, ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yet it was not a <hi>forced thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">§. 10. And were it in my power it ſhould be ſo ſtill: I would not deny Chriſtian Love, nor Church-Communion, nor publick encouragements, to any pious peaceable man for being an Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt: If he would not ſeparate for it from the Churches, if he would live peaceably with me, I would live peaceably with him, and ſhould be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48465:118"/>
loth to be behind with him in love and peace.</p>
                  <p n="11">§. 11. It is not (I ſay) Anabaptiſtry, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, nor any ſuch opinion which I impute our calamities to directly: But it is (next to Church Tyranny) the ſpirit of <hi>ſeparation</hi>; I mean, when men cannot ſo far differ in judgement from others, but a perverſe zeal for their opinion as ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent truth of God, doth inſtigate them to run away from thoſe that are againſt it, as if they were the enemies of the truth and God, and unworthy of the Communion of ſuch as they: which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a conjunction of <hi>Pride, Ignorance</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs</hi> (or <hi>Malice.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="12">§. 12. I have told theſe men that when they have ſpoken never ſo ſharply againſt <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that there is much of the ſame ſpirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: One ſaith, of Diſſenters, <hi>Away with ſuch unworthy perſons out of the Miniſtry or out of the Country:</hi> and the other ſaith, <hi>Away with ſuch unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons from your Communion</hi>: And both contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſts ſheep-mark which is Love, and both tend to make their Brethren ſeem unlovely: And whom they ſerve by this means, whether the Prince of Love, or the Prince of Malignity, it's pity but they knew; or at leaſt would conſider of it, inſtead of being angry with us when we tell them of it.</p>
                  <p n="13">§. 13. I am not therefore half ſo zealous to turn men from the opinion of Anabaptiſtry, as I am to perſwade both them and others, that it is their duty to live together with mutual forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in Love and Church-Communion notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch differences: For which they may
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48465:119"/>
ſee more reaſons given by one that once was of their mind and way (Mr. <hi>William Allen</hi> in his <hi>Retractation</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" rend="inter">Satan will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that you ſhould ſoberly read the Books.</note> and His <hi>Perſwaſive</hi> to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>) than any of them can ſoundly refel, though they may too eaſily reject them.</p>
                  <p n="14">§. 14. I am perſwaded that the formal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and people, who make little more uſe of Baptiſm, than to give it to Infants, and to receive it in Infancy, have been the greateſt occaſion of Anabaptiſtry among us: when the people ſee that all being Baptized in Infancy, many afterwards live all their days, and never underſtand what Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is, and few ever ſolemnly and diſtinctly own and renew that Covenant when they come to age, (unleſs coming to Church and receiving the Lords Supper with as little underſtanding, be a renewing it,) this tempteth ſerious people that underſtand not the matter well themſelves, to think that Infant-baptiſm doth but pollute the Churches, by letting in thoſe who know not what they do, and after prove prophane or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: And they think that it is the only way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to ſtay till they are ready to devote themſelves underſtandingly to God. But this is their miſtake: For, 1. If it were deferred till ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of age, one part would neglect it and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Infidels; and another part would <hi>do all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> as we ſee they do now at the <hi>other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> where the ſame Covenant is to be renewed. 2. There is a better remedy.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:48465:119"/>§. 15. For we hold that all that are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in Infancy ſhould as underſtandingly, and as ſeriouſly and (if it may be conveniently) as <hi>ſolemnly,</hi> own and make that Covenant with God when they come to age, as if they had never been baptized; (if not more, as being more obliged.) The reaſons of this I have given long ago at large, in a Treatiſe of Confirmation, written when we had hope of ſetting up this Courſe, under the name of Confirmation, which ſome of us practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in our Aſſemblies not without ſucceſs. To be ſeriouſly devoted to God by our Parents firſt, and to be brought at age as ſeriouſly to devote our ſelves to him, as any Anabaptiſt can do, is a much liklier way to fill the Church with ſerious Chriſtians, than to leave all men without the ſenſe of an early Infant obligation.</p>
                  <p n="16">§. 16. I am as fully perſwaded that Infants Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm is according to Gods will, as ever I was, when I was moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Controverſie: And I am perſwaded that theſe Papers of mine to Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> are ſo unſatisfactorily anſwered as is worſe than no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſheweth how little is to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="17">§. 17. Though the Act of Baptizing be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> yet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants hold that it is not ſo neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> but that in ſome caſes thoſe that are unba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized may be ſaved: As in caſe the Child die before it can be done, or in caſe the abſence or delay of the Baptizer be the cauſe: It is <hi>true-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to his Covenant</hi> (for our ſelves and thoſe that we have power to conſent and accept it for)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48465:120"/>
which Chriſt hath made <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation</hi>; and if he ſhould damn a <hi>true Conſenter,</hi> he ſhould damn one that hath the Love of God, and one to whom he promiſeth ſalvation, <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 18.</p>
                  <p n="18">§. 18. It is utterly incongruous to the reſt of the Law of Grace, which is ſpiritual, and to Chriſts alterations, who took down the Law of burdenſom Ceremonies; to think that he ſhould lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon the very outward waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that he would damn true Believers that Love God, for want of it: when he hath done ſo much to convince the world, that God ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him as will do it in ſpirit and truth, and that Circumciſion or Uncircumciſion is nothing, but Faith that worketh by Love: And if Penitent Loving Believers ſhall not be ſaved, Gods promiſes give us no aſſurance or ſecurity.</p>
                  <p n="19">§. 19. When the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4, 5. putteth [<hi>one Baptiſm</hi>] among the neceſſaries of Church-Concord, by Baptiſm is meant, <hi>our ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting our ſelves</hi> (and ours under that truſt) <hi>to Chriſt in the Baptiſmal Covenant</hi>; which can mean no more but that as there are three things (on our part) in Baptiſm, 1. <hi>Heart-conſent,</hi>

                  <p n="2">§. 2. Having peruſed his teſtimonies on both ſides, I am humbled and aſhamed for the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my heart, that doth not with floods of compaſſionate tears lament the pittiful condition of the ſeduced, that muſt be thus deceived in the dark; and of the Churches of Chriſt that muſt be thus aſſaulted, and ſhaken, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by ſuch inhumane horrid means: The book being compoſed, in that part of hiſtory which the ſtreſs of the cauſe lyeth on, of ſuch UNTRUTHS in <hi>fact</hi> and hiſtory, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it one of my greateſt difficulties to know how to call them.

And ſhould I not tell the Reader the <hi>truth of the caſe,</hi> I might help to betray him into too much fearleſneſs of his bait and ſnare, and I doubt I may be guilty of untruth by concealing the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of his untruths: And it is not matter of <hi>Argument,</hi> but <hi>fact</hi> that I am ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. But it pleaſeth that God whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are unſearchable, as to permit five parts of the Earth to remain yet ſtrangers unto Chriſt, ſo to permit his Church to be ſo tryed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted between <hi>Church Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>dividing ſeparations, Sects and parties,</hi> as that in many ages it hath not been eaſie to know which of them was the more pernicious.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. And it muſt grieve every conſcionable and diſcerning lover of Truth and Peace, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how theſe two Church-diſturbing parties, do by their extremities of oppoſition, increaſe as well as exaſperate each other: As the <hi>Ithaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Prelates did by the <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> by them. The Pride, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, dead formality, and cruel violence of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie Tyrants maketh the poor Sectaries think that they muſt go ſo far from them, till they have loſt themſelves and know not where they are;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48465:126"/>
and as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> muſters up a catalogue of my ſayings in his mode and dreſs, which ſeem ugly to the poor man that thinks he ſeeth Antichriſtianity in <hi>ſuch Goſpel</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> truths which he underſtandeth not, (Like that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly perſon, who thinks ſhe ſeeth Spiders upon every one that comes near her, and they muſt bruſh them off before ſhe can converſe with them, though ſhe be <hi>caetera ſana</hi>); ſo thoſe on the other extream think them ſo fanatick, and almoſt mad, that they are apt to ſuſpect eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word almoſt that they ſay, of madneſs, and ſometimes thereby injure the truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and ſoberer people, that partake not of their guilt, and ſo ſay of ſuch as agree with them but <hi>in aliquo tertio,</hi> They are all alike.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. This was the main cauſe which made St <hi>Martin</hi> ſeparate from his neighbour Biſhops, and deny communion with them to the death: Becauſe their perſecution of the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> had ſo animated the looſer ſort againſt ſtrict Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious people, that they had brought men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſuſpicion of <hi>Priſcillianiſm,</hi>, if they did but faſt, and pray, and read and talk of the Scripture. It's eaſie to ſee of late who they are that have done the like.</p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. When this ſort of men ſee the weakneſs of the Sectaries, and the bold-faced falſhood which ſuch as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> obtrude on the world, and hear them furiouſly revile what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, it maketh them think that they are fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than for humane ſocietie: And their conſciences juſtifie them for all the cruelties that

they uſe againſt either them, or more innocent perſons, whom in their ignorance and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs they number with them.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. And on the like account when they read and hear their erroneous Doctrines, and hear their incongruous words in prayer, they think they can never be too ſtrict in ſhackling them and all others in preſcribed forms: And nothing quieteth their Conſciences in all this ſo much, as the undeniable errors, and follies and miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of thoſe that thus provoke them.</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. But in this the Church in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> days did not think that way the wiſeſt cure: when he ſaith [<hi>Afferat, ut fieri ſolet, aliquam precem in qua loquatur contra regulam fidei (multi quippe irruunt in preces non ſolum ab imperitis loquaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ſed etiam ab haereticis compoſitas, &amp; per ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantiae ſimplicitatem non eas valentes diſcerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, utuntur iis, arbitrantes quod bonae ſint:) Nec tamen quod in eis perverſum eſt evacuat illa quae ibi recta ſunt; ſed ab eis potius evacuatur</hi>] Aug. de bapt. cont.

(no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if I be ſo.) And I doubt almoſt all the Church of Chriſt for 900 years, at leaſt in this mans recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                  <p n="1">§. 1.
<q>WHen he hath told you, that <hi>In his ſmall ſearch</hi> (ſhamefully ſmall) he cannot find there is any authentick teſtimony that it was practiſed on any till the fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; he in the next words ſaith that it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpake againſt it in <hi>Africa,</hi> which is clear evidence that ſome had been ſpeaking for it in that corner of the world:</q>]
This is no contradiction with him: And did they only <hi>ſpeak for it</hi> and not <hi>practiſe it?</hi> Speak once like a man: And was not that till the <hi>fourth Century?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. His Catalogue containeth three Columns: The firſt of the Baptiſm of the Adult: And what Chriſtian ever denied this? And what meaneth the man in labouring to prove it? The ſecond is of the Inſtituting and aſſerting of Infant-Baptiſm; of which more anon. The third is of his Witneſſes againſt Infant-Baptiſm. And the firſt of theſe mentioned in the Catalogue is <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the third Century. By which he ſeemeth to confeſs that till the third Century he hath no witneſs againſt it. But I have ſaid ſo much elſewhere and others more, to prove, 1. That <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> words prove that <hi>Infant-Baptiſm de facto</hi> was then in uſe; 2. That he only telleth his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48465:128"/>
of the point of <hi>convenience,</hi> but concludeth not againſt Infant-Baptiſm as <hi>unlawful</hi>; 3. That it is moſt probable he ſpeaketh of the Infants of <hi>Heathens</hi>; 4. That he ſpeaketh from that <hi>ſtrict ſingularity</hi> which made him plead alſo for the <hi>Montaniſts Fanaticiſm,</hi> and againſt <hi>ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi> and for his <hi>inordinate faſtings,</hi> &amp;c. as a man differing from the Churches and numbered with the Hereticks (though I think him a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Godly man.) And I refer it to the Readers judgement whether in my book of Infant-Baptiſm I have not proved by many other words in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> that he was not againſt all Infant-Baptiſm, but <hi>for it</hi> among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. His next and great Witneſs is the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> together. This is ſomething, were it true: but it is ſuch a kind of falſhood as I muſt not name in its due epithets, leſt you think me over-ſharp.</p>

                     <q>§. 4. His words are [<hi>Donatus</hi> a learned man in <hi>Africa</hi> taught that they ſhould baptize no Children but only that believed and deſired it.]</q>

Reader, if the queſtion be, what was done, ſaid or held by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men twelve hundred years ago, and the Writings of them and their Adverſaries were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and the Hiſtories written of them in that and the next Ages, would you have a man paſs by all proof from theſe, and tell you what a fellow of his own opinion ſaith eleven hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48465:128"/>
He brings us with great oſtentation the <hi>Dutch Anabaptiſts Martyrologie</hi> and ſuch like Hiſtories of a few years old, of fellows that knew little more than as he doth, what their Party or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions told them, or what they ignorantly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from ſuch Books as are yet to be ſeen by us as well as by them. If I ſhould diſpute what <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> held, would Mr. <hi>D.</hi> fetch his proofs from the writings of <hi>James Nailor,</hi> or <hi>George Fox,</hi> or <hi>Iſaac Pennington,</hi> yea or Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to prove his aſſertions, while <hi>Auguſtines</hi> works are at hand to be ſeen?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> is now quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in the quality of untruths: Reader, either this man had ſeen and read the Books of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> mentioned by him, or he had not.

                  <p n="8">§. 8. The Books are ſeven that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote of Baptiſm againſt the Donatiſts: And in them all I cannot find one ſyllable of intimation that ever the Donatiſts denied Infant-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>der, the Donatiſts were a great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men in <hi>Africa:</hi> They were <hi>Prelatical</hi> and for <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as the other Churches were: They differed from the reſt on the account of the <hi>Perſonal ſucceſſion</hi> of their Biſhops. In a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48465:129"/>
time of perſecution they ſaid (truly or falſly was a great controverſie) that one of the Biſhops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up the Church-books to the Perſecutors, to be burnt, rather than die himſelf, when they demanded them; And that the Catholick Biſhops received ſucceſſively their ordination from that man, and called them <hi>Traditores</hi>; whereas the Biſhop that all <hi>their Biſhops</hi> had ſucceſſively been ordained by, was one that had refuſed to deliver up the Church-books; And conſequently he was the right Biſhop, and they that had their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him were true Biſhops and Churches, and all the reſt were no true Biſhops or Churches; and therefore that all their Baptiſm and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were nullities, and their Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and that all people were bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as ever they would be ſaved to ſeparate from the reſt (called Catholicks) and to come to them and to be rebaptized. So that their Schiſm was much like the Papiſts, who confine the Church to their party, and condemn all others, ſave that the Papiſts (ordinarily) rebaptize not (though they ſay ſome Monks have done it, as elſewhere I have cited.) The Donatiſts were <hi>Epiſcopal ceremonious Separatiſts,</hi> that did it on the account of a <hi>purer Epiſcopal ſucceſſion.</hi> Till their days the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church had almoſt all been againſt drawing the ſword againſt Hereticks, even <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> himſelf. But the greatneſs of their party and the proud conceit of their greater zeal and ſtrictneſs than the Catholicks had, made them ſo furious that the Catholick Paſtors could not live quietly by them. Inſomuch that ſome of them
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48465:130"/>
wounded the Miniſters in the ſtreets, and ſome of them made a ſalt ſharp water and ſpouted into Miniſters eyes as they paſt the ſtreet, to put out their eyes; till many ſuch inſolencies provoked <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to change his judgement of toleration, (and eſpecially the multitudes ſeduced by them,) and the Biſhops to crave the Emperors aid: The Emperor made Edicts for mulcts and baniſhment to thoſe that perſevered: This (being a new way) ſo exaſperated the Donatiſts, that in very paſſion many of them (yea Biſhops) murdered themſelves to bring odium on the Catholicks, to make the people believe that the cruelty of the Catholicks compelled them to it: And this was the ſtate of theſe two parties; but not a word of difference about Infant-Baptiſm between them that ever I read in either part.</p>
                  <p n="10">§. 10. The Controverſie between <hi>Auſtin</hi> and them he thus ſtateth: Lib. 1. c. 1, 2. <hi>Si haberi foris poteſt, etiam dari cur non poteſt? Baptiſm received out of the Catholick or true Church among Schiſmaticks is true baptiſm: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptiſm given without by Schiſmaticks is true baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Impie facere qui rebaptizare conantur orbis unitatem, &amp; nos recte facere qui Dei Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta improbare, nec in ipſo ſchiſmate aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> They do impiouſly that endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize all the united Chriſtian world, and we do rightly who dare not deny Gods Sacraments, no not in a Schiſm.</q>]
For <hi>Auguſtin</hi> peaceably held the Donatiſts baptiſm to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>valid</hi> though irregular and unlawfully given and taken,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48465:130"/>
but the Donatiſts held all the Catholicks Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and baptiſm null.</p>
                  <p n="11">§. 11. Therefore he thus ſummeth up their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, cap. 3. <hi>Duo ſunt quae dicimus, &amp; eſſe in Catholica Baptiſmum, &amp; illic tantum recte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi: Item alia duo dicimus, eſſe apud Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas baptiſmum; non autem recte accipi: Harum ſententiarum tres noſtrae tantum ſunt, unam vero utrique dicimus.</hi>] That is,
<q>[Two things we ſay, that there is Baptiſm in the Catholick Church, and that there only it is rightly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Alſo two things more we ſay, that there is Baptiſm with the Donatiſts; but that with them it is not rightly received: of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, three are only ours, and one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us both:]</q>
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> held it a ſin, to be baptized among Schiſmaticks, (to joyn with their Sect) but not a nullity.</p>
                  <p n="12">§. 12. Hereupon he addreſſeth himſelf to evince the ſinfulneſs of their Schiſm and unchriſtianing all the Churches: And indeed he ſeems to think that though <hi>Baptiſm was among them,</hi> yet <hi>hardly Salvation:</hi> And his argument (though I think we muſt abate for mens <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi>) is worth the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> conſideration: <hi>that baptiſm that deſtroyeth (remitteth</hi> he calls it) <hi>not ſin, is not ſaving: that which is without love remitteth not ſin: But Schiſmaticks,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have not love:</hi> For, <hi>Nulli Schiſmata facerent ſi fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno odio non excaecarentur: Annon eſt in Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate odium fraternum? Quis hoc dixerit? Cum &amp; origo &amp; pertinacia Schiſmatis nulla ſit alia niſi odium fraternum.</hi>] That is,
<q>None would
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48465:131"/>
make ſchiſms if they were not blinded by the hatred of their brethren: Is there not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of brethren in Schiſm? <hi>What man will ſay ſo? Whenas both the Riſe and the Pertinacie of Schiſm is no other than the hatred of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>]</q>
But blind zeal will not let men know their own hatred, when yet they <hi>defame</hi> their brethren as <hi>no brethren,</hi> and endeavour to have all others <hi>think them ſo bad</hi> as <hi>not to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with,</hi> and ſeparate from them on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="13">§. 13. The main ſubject of all the reſt of theſe ſeven Books of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is to anſwer the Donatiſts claim of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his <hi>Carthage Council</hi> as on their ſide: and to anſwer all the ſayings of him and the ſeveral Biſhops of that Council. The plain truth is this: In the firſt age the Churches were ſo ſober and charitable as not to account every erring brother and party Hereticks, but ſuch as ſubverted the Eſſentials of Religion: And ſome of theſe corrupted the very form of Baptiſm: The baptiſm of theſe the Church took for null, and baptized ſuch as they pretended to have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the other <hi>African</hi> Biſhops knowing this, and being much troubled with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Churches about them, ſtretched this too far and rebaptized them that ſuch Hereticks bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as <hi>did not change the form of Baptiſm,</hi> but incorporated men into their corrupt ſocieties: The Donatiſts took advantage by this example and all the Reaſons of the Council, to go ſo much further as to take the <hi>Catholicks</hi> for <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>unlawful Churches,</hi> and <hi>rebaptize</hi> thoſe that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48465:131"/>
they baptized: <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwereth all the Councils reaſons, but praiſeth <hi>Cyprian</hi> as a holy Martyr, and no Heretick though miſtaken.</p>
                  <p n="14">§. 14. And it is not enough for me to ſay that all theſe Books of <hi>Auſtin</hi> have not a word of what he ſpeaketh, as <hi>controverting Infant-Baptiſm with the Donatiſts,</hi> but moreover, he bringeth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts agreement with the Catholicks in the point of Infant-Baptiſm, as a <hi>medium</hi> in his arguing againſt them, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 23. ſhewing how much baptiſm availeth, in that <hi>Chriſt himſelf would be baptized by a ſervant, and Infants that cannot themſelves believe are baptized</hi>

                  <p>Thus he argueth againſt the Donatiſts, If the whole Church hold Infant-Baptiſm, and no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will ſay that it is in vain, though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believe not and confeſs not, then you ſhould not ſay all baptiſm is vain becauſe we Catholicks adminiſter it, or becauſe it is received in our

Churches. The whole tenor of <hi>Auſtins</hi> charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language to the Donatiſts, and the ſcope of this place ſheweth, that he here pleaded <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent,</hi> and by [<hi>all the Church</hi>] and [<hi>no Chriſtian</hi>] includeth the Donatiſts.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very probable: Therefore the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> were not againſt <hi>Infant-baptiſm.</hi> For it is certain the <hi>Novatians</hi> were not: And the ſame <hi>Perin</hi> ſaith the Waldenſes were not.

The Churches made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of <hi>Infants Church-memberſhip,</hi> as being <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly</hi> in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and <hi>devoted to God by all faithful parents:</hi> And they took not <hi>baptiſm</hi> at firſt, for their <hi>firſt Covenanting</hi> or <hi>Conſent,</hi> but for the <hi>ſolemnization</hi> of it; and ſo not for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants firſt real ſtate of relation to Chriſt</hi> and right to life (which was <hi>before it,</hi> as it was to <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers before baptiſm</hi>;) but for the <hi>ſolemn inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in thoſe rights: And ſo <hi>Greg.

(viſible) and <hi>ſafe</hi> upon their Parents <hi>Covenant conſent,</hi> thought that the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>ſolemnization</hi> was ſo far left to prudence as that (as the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites did Circumciſion in the wilderneſs) it might be delayed a few years by ſuch Parents as deſired it, till children could ſomewhat anſwer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="60">§. 60. Yet after my review of this controverſie upon their urgencie, I find no proof brought by any of theſe men, that ever <hi>one Church</hi> in the world was without <hi>Infant-members,</hi> (that had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,) nor <hi>one perſon in the Church againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Church-memberſhip and baptiſm,</hi> from Chriſts days till the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (about eleven hundred or a thouſand years) except that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who took them for <hi>Innocent</hi> and therefore <hi>Church-members,</hi> did in ſome caſe adviſe the delay: I ſay, I find not one Chriſtian or Heretick againſt it: (unleſs you will impute it to them that were <hi>againſt all baptiſm,</hi> which Infidels alſo are.) And though I verily believe that the Waldenſes were not againſt Infant-baptiſm, nor is there full proof that any in their time were, yet becauſe I am loth to judge the Papiſts utterly impudent lyars, I think it moſt probable that in the <hi>Waldenſes days</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> there was a ſort of odious Hereticks, that denied Infant-baptiſm, and the Reſurrection, and held community of Wives and other abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations reported all together by their oppoſers in thoſe times.</p>

Ed. 1. ſaith thus [<hi>Yet is not Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>aſhamed to fix ſuch an abhominable ſlander upon the Baptiſts of this our age of baptizing naked: (which it ſeems was ſo long the real practice of the paedoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts) and about which he ſpends three whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to aggravate the heynouſneſs of their cuſtom (which he is pleaſed to father on them.) And though I am perſwaded he cannot but be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the thing is moſt notoriouſly falſe, and brought forth by him rather out of prejudice (not to ſay malice) rather than any proof or good teſtimony he ever received thereof; yet have I never heard that he hath done himſelf, his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neighbours and the abuſed world that right as to own his great weakneſs and ſinful ſhortneſs therein, in any of the many Editions of that piece, which I humbly conceive as well deſerved a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation as ſome other things he has judged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thereof.</hi>]</p>

I never look to ſpeak to them thus more, nor long to any man on earth, and in this ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and with theſe thoughts I muſt profeſs (not thinking it lawful to belie my ſelf) that in the year 1647. or 1648. or both when Anabaptiſtry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſuddenly to be obtruded with more ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fervency than before, I lived near Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in a Country where ſome were, and within the hearing of their practice in other parts of the land: And that in that beginning the common frame of Miniſters and people was, that in divers places <hi>ſome baptized naked and ſome did not:</hi> And that I never to my beſt remembrance heard man or woman contradict that report till this man did it in this writing: And that no Anabaptiſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted it to me that I then or ſince converſed with: And that thereupon in 1659. I wrote againſt <hi>both ſorts,</hi> thoſe that <hi>baptized naked,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>did not:</hi> And after all this when Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my book and thoſe very paſſages, <hi>he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denied the truth of the thing</hi> (though he did not ſo baptize himſelf (unleſs he have any where elſe ſince ſaid any thing of it which I never ſaw or heard of.) And I appeal to impartial reaſon, whether he would not then at the time have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, had it been deniable: And whether this man now twenty five or ſix years after be fitter to be believed in a matter of fact, than common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the preſent time?

                  <p n="4">§. 4. But if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would perſwade the world either that I wrote that of <hi>all</hi> the Anabaptiſts, or of <hi>moſt,</hi> or of any in any other age, or that I have ſince ſaid that <hi>any continue</hi> the ſame practice, he would but deceive men: for it is nothing ſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. I muſt confeſs I did not <hi>ſee the perſons ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized naked,</hi> nor do I take it to be lawful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame any upon doubtful reports: But when it is a fame <hi>common</hi> and not <hi>denied by themſelves</hi> either <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>people</hi> at <hi>the time,</hi> I think it is to be taken ſo much notice of, as the confuting of the evil doth require.</p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. I know not by ſight that there is ever a Fornicator, Adulterer, Murderer or Thief (as I remember) in <hi>England:</hi> And yet if I neither Write nor <hi>Preach</hi> to call ſuch to repentance, leſt I be a Slanderer in ſaying that there are any ſuch, I think it would be fooliſh uncharitable Charity, and unrighteous juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. Moſt Sects do in their height and heat at firſt do that which afterward they ſurceaſe with ſhame: The Donatiſt Circumcellians continued not ſelf-murder; the Anabaptiſts held not on to do as they did at <hi>Munſter,</hi> or in the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George</hi>: Our Ranters continued not open <hi>ſwearing</hi> and <hi>whoredom</hi> long: The fame of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> which I never heard gainſayed is that the Quakers at firſt did <hi>ſhake</hi> and <hi>vomit</hi> and infect others ſtrangely: And is he a lyar that ſaith it,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48465:150"/>
becauſe they do not ſo now? I was at <hi>Worceſter</hi> my ſelf when at the Aſſizes one of them went na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (as a Prophet) before our eyes through the high ſtreet, and they ſaid they did ſo in many other places: I know not the mans name now, nor any of the multitude of Spectators, if after twenty years and more I were called to prove it. I know by uncontrolled fame that Miſtreſs <hi>Suſan Pierſon</hi> ſolemnly undertook to raiſe the dead (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a dead Quaker at <hi>Claines</hi> and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him (in vain) to live.) But if now after more than twenty years my witneſſes were called for, I muſt travel to the place before I could produce them.</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. Yea, I never ſaw any Anabaptiſt reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize (or baptize the aged:) But fame ſaith they do ſo and none deny it.

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s frequent Citations of my Words.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. WHen I read Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his twenty Citations of me as againſt my ſelf, which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> provoketh me to anſwer, and when I find Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſo often imitating them, and alledging my words, as juſtifying his cauſe, I have no conviction on my mind that it is lawful for me to waſt my time and the Readers, about a particular vindication of my words, ſo triflingly and vainly uſed by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. Either it is the <hi>authority of the Writer</hi> which they ſuppoſe will ſerve them, or the <hi>force of the arguments</hi>; or elſe it is only to make the Reader believe that the <hi>Writer is ſo fooliſh</hi> as not to know when he <hi>contradicteth</hi> himſelf. The <hi>firſt</hi> I may well preſume it is not: If it <hi>were,</hi> the ſame perſons authority would be as <hi>much more</hi> againſt them as his <hi>judgement</hi> is. If it be the <hi>ſecond,</hi> why do they uſe any arguments of mine, when they are able to form ſuch of their own as ſeem much more uſeful to them than any that I can give them? And why then do they not inſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Argument and neglect the Author? But ſeeing I muſt believe that the laſt is their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, I can have leiſure to ſay little more than this to them, that it is not my buſineſs to prove my ſelf no fool but to prove Infants Church-members; nor will it make me ſmart if all of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48465:151"/>
their mind in <hi>England</hi> ſo judge of me; But yet I am not ſo fooliſh but that I know my own mind better than they do, and can reconcile my words when they cannot. If this ſatisfie not them, it ſatisfieth me.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. In ſumm, the words of mine which they alledge againſt my ſelf need but theſe two things to be ſaid for them againſt ſuch ſilly cavils: 1. That moſt of them ſpeak to the Queſtion [<hi>What is the kind of Covenant conſent required in baptiſm? Whether a meer dogmatical faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed? Or the profeſſion of a ſaving faith?</hi> as to the <hi>matter believed</hi> and the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and conſent?</hi>] And I prove that it is no <hi>other ſort</hi> of faith, but <hi>a true ſaving faith</hi> as to <hi>object</hi> and <hi>act</hi> which is required and accepted of God the ſearcher of hearts, as the <hi>Condition</hi> of his Covenant: And that it is not the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of any <hi>lower ſort of faith</hi> (as to <hi>object</hi> or <hi>act</hi>) but of this ſaving faith, which the Church muſt accept to the admiſſion of members: A lower profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſerve for none. 2. But I ſtill maintain (and I think fully proved) that God ſo far taketh the child as if he were a part of the Parent (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and grace having committed him to his will and diſpoſal for his good till he have a will to chooſe for himſelf) as that by <hi>this ſort of faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> the <hi>Parent</hi> is to enter his Child into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God as well as himſelf, and that in Gods acceptance the Child doth thus <hi>truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> by the <hi>believing Parent, and doth Covenant with God,</hi> as a child <hi>Covenanteth</hi> and <hi>conſenteth reputatively</hi> among men, who by his Parents is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48465:151"/>
made a <hi>Party in a Contract,</hi> as in a leaſe for his life, or the like. Not that <hi>in ſenſu phyſico</hi> the perſon of the Child being the ſame with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents doth <hi>conſent in his conſent</hi>; but that the Parent having the treble intereſt in the Child, of an <hi>Owner,</hi> a <hi>Governour</hi> and a <hi>Lover,</hi> God by Nature and Grace conjunctly alloweth and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Parent to dedicate the Child to God, and to conſent that he ſhall be a member of Chriſt and his Church according to his capacity, and by that Covenanting conſent to oblige the Child to live as a Chriſtian when he cometh to age: And this ſhall be as acceptable to the Childs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-relation and rights, as if he had done it himſelf; and in this ſenſe may be ſaid reputatively to have conſented or Covenanted by his Parents, which in proper ſpeech, is, <hi>They did it for him at Gods Command.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Of <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi>'s many other accuſations of me.</head>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. IT was one of the old Characters of the Hereticks in the Apoſtles dayes, <hi>To ſpeak evil of the things that they underſtood not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that may well be their Character in which they contradict the three great conſtitutive parts of Chriſtianity, and all Religion, and true honeſty, <hi>viz.</hi> TRUTH, HUMILITY and LOVE, <hi>by Falſhood, Pride</hi> and <hi>Malignity,</hi> (called commonly <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitablneſs.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. The Root of this is, when Reigning, an <hi>unſanctified heart</hi> in which theſe vices remain unmortified, covered from the owners knowledge, by a form of Godlineſs, and eſpecially a zeal for the wayes of ſome Party, more honoured in the perſons eyes for wiſdom, or piety than others: In others there is a <hi>great meaſure</hi> of the ſame <hi>vices</hi> mixed with <hi>true Grace,</hi> where an evil and a good cauſe are conjoyned as to ſome effects: They love God and his Truth, and they hate all that they think againſt him, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote piety in the world, and repreſs what they think againſt it; And being perſons whoſe <hi>wits</hi> and <hi>ſtudies</hi> were not ſuch, as <hi>exactneſs</hi> and <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of knowledge do require, but yet lovers of knowledge, truth, and Scripture, they have
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48465:152"/>
more knowledge than prophane ſots, but little, alas, little, in compariſon of that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a methodical, accurate underſtanding of the matters which frequently fall under contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; And ſo knowing but little they know not what they are ignorant of, nor what others know beyond them; And it being the common vice of mans underſtanding, to be <hi>haſty in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> before they hear or know one half that is neceſſary to a true and faithful judgement, and ſo to be <hi>confident</hi> before they underſtand, theſe men hereby are led to <hi>confidence</hi> in many an error: And an erring judgement firſt telleth them that Truth is falſhood, and falſhood truth, that Good is evil, and evil good, that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſin, and ſin is duty; and then a good cauſe and a bad, the Love of Truth and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and partial zeal concur, to put them on in the way of error. <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>error</hi> ſet them on a <hi>wrong cauſe,</hi> and a <hi>mixt affection</hi> or <hi>zeal,</hi> partly <hi>good</hi> and partly <hi>evil</hi> ſpurreth them on. And in theſe the <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſins, are no more predominant than the <hi>cauſe</hi>; and God will have mercy on thoſe that in ignorance, with good meanings, oppoſe many truths, and do much evil.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. And the great means of nouriſhing this ſin in Churches is departing from Chriſts Church order, who hath appointed <hi>Teaching and Learning</hi> to be the ſetled way of getting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; And therefore required all his diſciples to come to his Church, as little children to School, with teachable humble minds, to Learn, and not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48465:153"/>
with proud wrangling minds to diſpute: If all our children ſhould ſpend their time at School in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Teacher and ſetting their wits againſt his as in a conflict, what would they thus Learn?</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive,</hi> and oft calleth men from <hi>perverſe diſputings,</hi> and <hi>ſtriving about words which ſubvert the hearers,</hi> and from ſuch <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings</hi> as <hi>edifie not</hi> but <hi>tend to more ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (though the <hi>faith may be contended</hi> for, and truth defended, when oppoſition maketh it truly neceſſary).</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. When a man ſeeketh after knowledge as a <hi>Learner,</hi> he meeteth it with a <hi>willing mind</hi>; he cometh <hi>towards</hi> it with an <hi>appetite,</hi> and ſo is a <hi>capable receiver:</hi> But when a man cometh as a <hi>diſputant,</hi> he is ingaged already to <hi>one ſide,</hi> and if that be <hi>falſe</hi> he cometh out to <hi>fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth,</hi> with a <hi>ſpirit of oppoſition, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting truth</hi> as <hi>error,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> as <hi>evil,</hi> and thinks it his <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> to deſtroy and ſhame it if he can, and therefore is unapt to think what may be <hi>ſaid for it,</hi> but ſtudyeth all that he can <hi>againſt it.</hi> And is this loathing, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fighting againſt truth the way to know it?</p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. Therefore that which hath undone the Churches peace is, that too many Teachers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves too forward to controverſies, have too haſtily drawn in their people into their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and caſt ſuch bones before them in books and pulpits inſtead of food, which break their teeth and ſet them together by the ears inſtead of nouriſhing them. And ſo one mans hearers
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48465:153"/>
are taught to diſpute for this ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and anothers for that ſort; one mans for <hi>free-will</hi> and anothers <hi>againſt it</hi>; when perhaps neither they nor the maſter of the quarrel can tell you what <hi>it is?</hi> and ſo of an hundred more ſuch like. The honeſt hearers when they ſhould be digeſting the ancient Chriſtian doctrine, and learning to increaſe in Love to God and man, and to practiſe a holy and a heavenly life, and prepare for a comfortable death, and happy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by a Living faith and hope, are taught that if they be not zealots for <hi>this opinion</hi> or that, for <hi>Anabaptiſtry,</hi> for <hi>ſeparation,</hi> &amp;c. if they pray by a book, or if they joyn with thoſe that hold ſuch things as they hear called by odious frightful names, they are not then <hi>right zealous Chriſtians,</hi> but <hi>corrupt</hi> or <hi>complyers</hi> or <hi>lukewarm</hi>; And thus each Church is made a miſerable Church-militant, and trained up to war againſt each other.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. And this Miniſters have done, partly to ſtrengthen themſelves by the conſent and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their adherents, as the Captain muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer by his Souldiers: When they can ſet a great number on hating their adverſaries, and backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, and telling the hearers wherever they come, to make them ſeem odious, how errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bad ſuch and ſuch men are, they think they have done much of their work? And while they think it is <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> they know not how notably they pleaſe and ſerve the <hi>Devil.</hi> But I muſt remember that I have ſpoken of this elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and ſo diſmiſs it.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:48465:154"/>§. 8. That Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> and his imitaters <hi>ſpeak evil</hi> (confidently and vehemently) of the things they <hi>know not</hi> (yea very many ſuch) I am ſure. But from what principle or root, or how far that vice which produceth theſe fruits is mortified or unmortified as to all others, I am neither called nor willing to judge. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how Mr. <hi>Tho. Pierce</hi> once dealt with me: When my Religious neighbour could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perſwaded to communicate with thoſe among them that were of his judgement, ſaying, they were men that would ſwear and lie, and lived ſcandalouſly, I thought it my duty (to keep up diſcipline and yet) to moderate their cenſures by telling them what ſins I thought might ſtand with ſome meaſure of ſincere piety, and Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And what doth he but hence take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to tell the world how looſe my doctrine was, and what ſinful perſons I thought had grace? So now if I ſhould ſay, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe hard-faced falſhoods heaped together, and confidently obtruded on the ignorant, even about publick and viſible matter of fact, yet I hope the Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

The offence which Chriſt dreadfully condemneth, which is ſcandalizing the weak or laying ſnares or ſtumbling-blocks before them, to tempt them to think ill of Chriſt, or Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to commit any ſin, I would avoid as carefully as I can, And to avoid it I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that which offendeth you. But the offence which is but <hi>Diſpleaſing diſſenters,</hi> yea <hi>miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men,</hi> I little regard on my own account. And your talk of <hi>my loſs</hi> (or <hi>being loſt</hi>) doth ſavour ſo rankly of a <hi>humane hypocritical tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> as maketh me remember what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter Math.</hi> 16.23. that would have had him ſave himſelf from ſuffering, though I will not ſpeak out ſuch unpleaſing words to you: But your words ſavour too much of the fleſh. O Sir, it is but a few moments more, and you and I ſhall be in a world, where the thoughts and words of mortals, of us, will be of ſmall importance to us! And themſelves are haſting to the day when all their thoughts periſh. O ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of? Would you tempt me to look to the hypocrites reward? the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48465:156"/>
approbation of man? O miſerable reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Were not that book odious to you, I would refer you for my Reaſons to the two Chapters of <hi>Man-pleaſing and Pride:</hi> If Gods approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeem not enough for us, why call we him our God?</p>
                  <p>But if I have <hi>loſt ſo much</hi> as you intimate, you would perſwade me that my ſervice is more than I take it to be? I have felt little comfort in any ſervice of God which coſt me nothing. But you ſhall not tempt me to over-value it ſo much; I find no loſs at all by it. What have I loſt Sir? Not one farthing or farthings-worth, that I am aware of! As I lived not on any man before, ſo I am never the poorer for that duty now. Is it mens <hi>praiſe or good thoughts</hi> of me? Not one friend to my remembrance in the City or Land hath once told me his <hi>diſſent,</hi> much leſs that I have loſt his <hi>good eſteem</hi>: (Only one young man that heard me Preach came for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about one of the particulars, who was ſatisfied as far as I could perceive, and I wiſht him but to read over all in my book (about that you object concerning the Crucifix) and I heard of him no more.) And if I am ſo much <hi>loſt with my friends,</hi> and no one of them in <hi>England</hi> tell me that he <hi>diſſenteth,</hi> and <hi>wherein,</hi> ſuch friends are not ſo valuable as to be any of my <hi>felicity!</hi> And do you call a man [<hi>loſt</hi>] that loſeth the <hi>thoughts</hi> or the <hi>breath</hi> of man? As it is their own <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>ſin,</hi> I regard all mens thoughts or words, and ſo would <hi>pleaſe all men for their good to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> But as to my <hi>own comfort</hi> I can ſpare

                     <hi>yours and theirs</hi>; and if you and a thouſand ſuch ſhould write a Cart-load of Calumnies as you have done, I think they would break but little of my ſleep. Set theſe arguments next before hypocrites that <hi>live on man</hi>: I live not on them.</p>
                  <p>But your words do mind me, how men that are embodyed in little parties, (far leſs than the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> or <hi>Novatians</hi>) are inclined to take their Cabin for all the Kingdom, and their Sect for the Church, and are affected with their praiſe or diſpraiſe almoſt as if they were all the world. You hear your folks it ſeems talk againſt me (with whom backbiting is a duty) and you ſeem to dream that it is <hi>all my friends.</hi> If God in Chriſt will be my friend, I can ſpare others.</p>
                  <p>And tell me Sir, for <hi>what prize</hi> or gain do you think I am <hi>loſt with all my friends?</hi> No man in his wits will voluntarily <hi>be loſt for nothing.</hi> Do you think it is to get <hi>other friends</hi> that I more value?

                  <p>And yet I will add, that though being long ago glutted with mens applauſe, as finding it a <hi>luſcious</hi> but <hi>unwholeſome</hi> thing, and having <hi>voluntarily caſt up much of it my ſelf,</hi> I yet perceive no want of friends, but take your words of them for meer ſlanders.</p>

Either this man knew me and my writings herein, or not. If not, what a man is this that dare talk thus confidently and falſly of what he knew not?

Do I need to tell the Reader (only for the ſake of youths and forreigners) that when the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> cauſe was at the bar, when ſpeaking had any room and hope, they ſet me in their forlorn, and engaged me (with my Conſcience and deſire to have prevented that which I foreſaw) in the tasks of <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking</hi> which would moſt exaſperate and offend the Biſhops; till I was I think the firſt among them that was forbidden to Preach. I continued after that in <hi>London</hi> a year, where I never had place or flock, but was a ſtranger: ſickneſs then forced me to remove into the Countrey. The <hi>Tents</hi> I was ſheltered in, were <hi>Gods protection</hi> in my own habitation; which if a <hi>hole</hi> I thought good enough for me. I Preacht to ſuch as would hear me, till, being near the Church door, and the people numerous, <hi>Clergie-envy</hi> cauſed me to be ſent to the common Gaol, among malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; As ſoon as I was out, another warrant

was put into the Officers hands to apprehend me again, and ſend me to <hi>Newgate</hi> for ſix months; Upon which I removed my dwelling to the next Village out of the County: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed none there that deſired to hear me, of my Neighbours. The writings which he revileth, ſhew that I lived not idle; And I think he could wiſh I had done leſs and ſpoken to fewer. I came not out of that <hi>hole</hi> of many months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Indulgence was granted: I ſtayed on reaſons of Self-denyal, becauſe I would fore-ſtall no <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, nor hinder their Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and therefore reſolved to ſtay till they were ſetled: I came on terms of far <hi>greater Self-denyal,</hi> to the great abatement of my health, (to ſay nothing of my greater coſt,) which now hath again forced me at preſent to retire.

                  <p>As for his talk of [<hi>Diſgracing the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>] it's true in two ſenſes. 1.

2. But ſee the miſery of a Sectarian ſpirit, that taketh it for a contradiction to be a friend to <hi>Calvin and Arminius</hi> both?

But indeed Sir, the Controverſies intended by you under theſe names, are not ſuch as a man of my poor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure can fix his judgement in every young, and promiſe that it ſhall never change, nor that I can take it for a ſhame to grow any wiſer in them, than heretofore, though perhaps your judgement changed not from your Childhood.

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48465:161"/>
of this Writer, to anſwer ſolidly all that can be ſaid againſt it. I take it to be <hi>Plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable</hi> that the Scripture is certainly true: And yet I take it to be quite above this confident mans ability well to ſolve all the difficulties ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected? were it but thoſe poor ones of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus. Spinoſa</hi> in his late peſtilent <hi>Tractatus The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologico-Politicus.</hi> I think I have plain proof that God is not the Author of ſin, and man is not moved in it and all his acts as an engine by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable neceſſitation: But I deſpair that ten years ſtudy more ſhould inable this Writer, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſolve the objections of <hi>Hobbes</hi> or <hi>Camero</hi> about it. In a word, though we have <hi>Plain proof that Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> I ſhould be loth that the faith of this Nation ſhould lie upon the ſucceſs of a diſpute about it, between a crafty Infidel and this ſelf-conceited man.</p>
                  <p n="21">§. 21. And why ſhould my impartiality in acknowledging the Churches <hi>liberty</hi> as to the time of Baptiſm, at firſt, be ſo unkindly received? I meant not, nor ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt had</hi> left it <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> and to their <hi>Liberty,</hi> but that they left <hi>one another</hi> at liberty herein: Becauſe 1. The firſt and great work was in ſetling the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by converting <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the faith: And the Adult who were the active mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, were they that the Apoſtles had moſt to do with, (and therefore whoſe caſe is expreſly ſpoken of.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it was a known thing that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Church-members had ever been Church-members and were in poſſeſſion of that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48465:162"/>
when Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſet up Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And it was a granted caſe, that all Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons devoted themſelves and all that they had to God; and every thing according to its capacity: And therefore their Infants according to their capacity, which God himſelf had before expounded.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And it was never the meaning of Chriſt to lay ſo much on the outward waſhing, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papiſts and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do: But as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed Infants in the Wilderneſs were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Church-members and ſaved; ſo when Infants were in the Covenant of God by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents true and known conſent, their damnation was not to be feared, upon their dying unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ſurprize.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But yet obedience to God being neceſſary, many Parents haſtned their childrens Baptiſm, at two or three dayes old. Others ſtaid till the eighth day: others longer; and multitudes had children that were in ſeveral degrees entred on the uſe of reaſon, when the Parents were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and it remained doubtful whether they were (as to the Covenant) at their Parents choice or their own: And to this day there want not thoſe that think that Baptiſm was not inſtituted to be the ordinary initiating Sacrament of the children of Church-members, but only of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes; And that <hi>Chriſtians Infants</hi> took their places in the Church of <hi>courſe,</hi> but <hi>Proſelytes from without</hi> only were to be <hi>Baptized.</hi> Though this be an error, it is probable that there were
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48465:162"/>
ſome then, as well as now of that opinion. But nothing more occaſioned (as far as I can find) the delay of Baptiſm, than the fear of the danger of ſinning after it, eſpecially of apoſtaſie. All held that all ſin paſt was pardoned in Baptiſm. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and 10. and other texts, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine of the Church made them think it a very perillous thing to ſin wilfully after illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and the acknowledgement of the truth. And therefore abundance delayed their own Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm till age, and many were backward to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize their children, leſt childiſh folly and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts, and worldly temptations, ſhould draw them to trample upon the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; And on ſuch accounts, all were not Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized at one age. And divers that were Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized at age upon their own converſion from Heatheniſm, were not ſuddenly ſo <hi>knowing,</hi> as to be acquainted with all the caſes about their childrens rights, but muſt have a conſiderable time to learn. For it was (be it ſpoken without offence to ſtricter men) a General and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſort of Knowledge which the Apoſtles and the Primitive Churches required in the adult as neceſſary to Baptiſm, yea when they had at laſt kept them long under Catechizing. For even in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, though all uſed the <hi>ſame words</hi> of Baptiſm, ſo few had a clear underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the very Baptiſmal form or words, that (writing <hi>(ubi ſupra) de bapt. contr.

                  <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                  <p>REader, having the following vindication of Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> put into my hand, I think it not unmeet upon this occaſion to undeceive ſome who to render his example in receding from the way of Separation wherein he was ſometime engaged upon the account of Infant-baptiſm, the leſs imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and his endeavours to draw off others, the leſs ſucceſsful; have given out that he did but turn with the times for worldly ends when the King came in. Whereas I can bear him witneſs that that return was made by him the year before the coming in of the King, as did ſufficiently appear to me both by Letters which then paſſed between him and my ſelf about that affair, and alſo by his book called <hi>A Retractation of Separation,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by him that ſame year. Which Book I would entreat the ſober Reader to get and lend to ſome of the ſeparating mind: they will find no temporizing or formality in it, but a ſpirit of Chriſtian love and peace. And if the reaſons in that Book and in his <hi>perſwaſive to peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> ſince publiſhed, be ſuch as none of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts can confute or ſtand before, they will have no reaſon to impute the Authors change to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſon or worldly intereſt. I queſtion not but experience after trial, which is wont to make teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men wiſer, put him upon reviewing the grounds of his practice, and ſo had a great hand in that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration which he made. And I would have thoſe
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48465:175"/>
who account it a diſparagement to a man to alter his Judgement at any time, to tell us at what age we come under that law, when we muſt grow no wiſer nor no better.</p>
                  <p>And what I ſay of Mr. <hi>Allens</hi> alteration of his judgement, I muſt ſay alſo of Mr. <hi>Lambs,</hi> whom thoſe that eaſily judge before they know, have accuſed alſo as turning with the times, when as on my knowledge his change was in 1658. or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of 1659. For by letters I did ſollicite him to that alteration and received his anſwers, ſooner than I knew of Mr. <hi>Allens</hi> change: And I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Mr. <hi>Lambs</hi> words and example are ſlighted by very many, upon two accuſations, 1. That he is run into the other extream of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much conformity: 2. That he is over hot. As to the firſt, my diſtance maketh me a ſtranger to his mind and practice. But as long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth not as Miniſters do, but to that which belongeth to a private man, what doth he more than Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> hath largely written for? And Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> hath written to prove it lawful to hear Conformiſts in the Pariſh Churches, and for the Magiſtrates to appoint publick Teachers for the people. 2. And as to the ſecond (not juſtifying my own earneſtneſs, much leſs others which I am not acquainted with) to calm the minds of the offended I may well ſay, 1. That it is no wonder if a man that is naturally of a warm and earneſt ſpirit, do ſhew it moſt when he thinks that he ſpeaks for God, and Truth, and the Church, and mens Souls. 2. That it is no wonder if a man that was drawn himſelf ſo deep into the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48465:175"/>
guilt, as to be a Teacher of an Anabaptiſts Church and to write for them, be an earneſt expreſſer of his Repentance when he is recovered, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſirous to ſave others from the ſnares in which he was intangled, and to do as much for Truth, Unity and peace, as ever he did againſt it.</p>

                        <p>I Having ſome intimation that you are about to make ſome return to the Author of a late Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Baptiſm, do apprehend that if you think fit to Print this following Paper at the end of your Book, you may do the good office of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſtumbling-block, at which ſome are too apt to daſh their foot, and thereby alſo further caution men againſt being miſled by giving too much credit to the quotation of Authors, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by that Treatiſor.</p>
                        <p>In reading a Treatiſe of Baptiſm of the firſt Edition, Penned by <hi>H. D.</hi> I obſerved that in the two laſt pages of his Poſtſcript, he mentions two diſcourſes that were publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed I am ſorry that that author ſhould put me upon any neceſſity of reflecting ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in vindicating my ſelf, as to tell the world
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48465:176"/>
that upon this occaſion I having twice reviewed that Book of mine, did not find ſo much as the mention of either of thoſe two words <hi>will-worſhip or idolatry,</hi> upon any occaſion whatſoever. Nor am I conſcious to my ſelf of ever being ſo abſurd as once to think that to be idolatry, which he moſt untruly ſaith I call ſo in that Book. That cauſe doubtleſs whatſoever it is, is little beholding to ſuch an Advocate as thinks to reconcile men to it by abuſing diſſenters.</p>
                        <p>As for the alteration I have made, I gave the world an account of the reaſons and grounds of it, in my <hi>Retractation of Separation,</hi> publiſhed in the year 1659. which was before the turn of times, and in my <hi>perſwaſive to Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> ſince publiſhed. And if this Author could have ſolidly diſcovered the inſufficiency of thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and grounds to juſtifie ſuch an alteration and my preſent practice, he would have done his cauſe better ſervice in my opinion, than he hath done in his Treatiſe by labouring to ſupport it by a miſrepreſentation of perſons and their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. As for me, I can truly ſay I have had great ſatisfaction and peace in my own mind, touching the alteration I have made upon thoſe grounds, not only at other times, but even then alſo when I have been near unto death in my own apprehenſion. As for the other perſon he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with me, I ſuppoſe he may e're long give the world an account of that alteration he alſo is charged with as great fault.</p>

                     <p>YOur vehement importunity having greatly injured me, by occaſioning the loſs of ſome of my time (who have none to ſpare) upon this writing, which elſe would have been needleſs; you muſt bear with me while I deſire you, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time alone, to anſwer theſe Queſtions ſeriouſly to your Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether the untruths in matter of fact which you confidently publiſh, be not of ſo ſtupendious a magnitude, as ſhould have affrighted the Conſcience of a Turk or Pagan? When no leſs than four whole <hi>Bodies of men</hi> are ſo ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you, the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the <hi>Novatians,</hi> the Old <hi>Brittains,</hi> and the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> each containing, it's like many hundred thouſands: And when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>whole Books</hi> (not particular ſentences only) are falſified accordingly?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How <hi>great a number would</hi> your untruths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, were they all gathered and enumerated to you? When in all the lines which I have examined I have met with ſo few that are not guilty of them?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When you accuſe my Admonition to Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> and thereby ſhew that you read it, ſhould not the eviction of fourſcore undeniable untruths, in matter of fact, have been a warning to you to avoid the like?</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:48465:177"/>4. Whether you do not more by ſuch notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcandal to diſhonour your ſelf and all that are ſuch, and hinder your own ſucceſſes, than many writings againſt you could have done?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whether you do not ſcandalouſly tempt men to juſtifie the contempt of <hi>Tender Conſciences,</hi> and what is done and ſaid againſt them by many publick Revilers on the other extream, when your Conſcience pretending tenderneſs can ſwallow ſuch Camels, while it cannot endure our Infant-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whether men can judge it probable that ſuch voluminous notorious Forgers and Slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, have ſo much more illumination than all other Chriſtians, as to be meet men to call all the Chriſtian world almoſt to be new Chriſtned, and to unchriſten almoſt all for about thirteen hundred years (to leave out the controverted time?)</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Would you be believed in other things that can deliberately, in two Editions, do thus?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Is it like that God will bleſs ſuch unmanly ſcandals, to the Churches good? (unleſs as ſin by overruling providence may occaſion good.) Are theſe likely means to propagate truth?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. What is the matter that men that can do all this, cannot <hi>Conform?</hi> What durſt I not <hi>ſubſcribe to,</hi> if I durſt do all this?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Is it not a diſhonour to your rebaptized Churches to be ſo polluted, and to have ſo looſe or partial a diſcipline, as to ſuffer ſuch publick ſcandals as theſe: and to retain ſuch a member as you, and not bring you to repentance or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48465:177"/>
you? Have our worſt Pariſh Churches many greater ſcandals?</p>
                     <p>If pride, partiality and paſſion will not let your Conſcience work upon theſe things, but you will turn them into gall inſtead of repentance, at leaſt I offer them to the Conſideration of others, to prevent or remedy their infection.</p>
                     <p>And remember (which you have told the world now in Print) that you ſent your Bookſeller to me, to know what I had to ſay againſt your firſt Edition, before you publiſhed the ſecond; And I have here partly told you what: I was not ſo idle as to anſwer your Reaſons, knowing how little a part they are of what Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> hath ſaid more largely: And that I anſwer him at all, is long of you, who would not let me hold my peace. I heartily deſire your Recovery from the <hi>unthankful error,</hi> and your Repentance for the ſinful means of propagating it, and for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to our early Rights and bleſſings.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. 1. MY Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> being written about the ſame time as my Epiſtle to Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> his book, hath ſince then been detained in the <hi>Printers</hi> hand, whoſe delay hath allowed me the ſight of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Reply to Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> and the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48465:181"/>
of animadverting on it, before mine is come abroad. And upon my moſt impartial conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it reneweth the grief of my heart to think of theſe evils which it ſets before me.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. 1. That the ſouls of poor Chriſtians ſhould be under the Temptations of ſuch writings and teaching as here we find: Where ſuch untruths in matter of fact are ſtill juſtified with ſuch a face of confidence, and divulged as for God, and for the ſouls of men, that moſt ignorant perſons may be tempted to think that <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> require them to believe, that they are real truths, it being a harſh unmanly thing to judge that ſuch a perſon can poſſibly be ſo hardened, as to ſtand ſo boldly to all theſe things, which have ſuch publick hiſtorical evidence, if they were all downright falſhoods.</p>
                     <p>And it is a hard task for a writer to be put to anſwer a Chriſtian and a Gentleman as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth Mr. <hi>Wills, Repl. pag.</hi> 120.
<q>[<hi>Know that hence you have a further diſcovery</hi> of the great unfaithfulneſs and want of conſcience in the Author, for daring thus to abuſe the world with a Cheat, and that which he <hi>knoweth</hi> to be a meer forgery of his own] And <hi>pag.</hi> 122. [Let it be judged whether he hath not injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly belied <hi>Oſiander,</hi> belied <hi>Cluniacenſis,</hi> beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Peter Bruis,</hi> belied the truth, which by this forgery he would cover and hide; abuſed the world, belied and abuſed me—But much more fear his own conſcience by this piece of folly and falſhood.]</q>
To be thus at [<hi>Thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi>] and [<hi>Thou lieſt</hi>] is an unſavoury work;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48465:181"/>
Yea in ſo few lines to give the Lie five times at leaſt. But for an ignorant Reader to believe what <hi>this Author hath done</hi> till he <hi>needs muſt,</hi> is yet far harder. Though we ſay, <hi>He that will ſwear, will lie,</hi> and therefore we hardly believe a ſwearer; yet if a man with many hundred bloody oaths ſhould aſſert many particulars of publick cogniſance, we are ready to think it inhumane to ſuſpect that the man is ſo inhumane as thus to ſwear if ſome of them were not true. Alas for the poor Church of Chriſt, that muſt have ſuch ſore temptations! How ſhall they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood!</p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. 2. And how ſad is it that a Chriſtian man profeſſing not only <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> but ſo much of theſe as to be above Communion with ſuch as we, ſhould ever degenerate into ſuch a thing as his preſent writing doth diſcover! O what need have we to lay to heart that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>be not high-minded but fear?</hi> and to learn over and over, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. and Chriſt's words to the Sons of Thunder, <hi>ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">§. 4. And alas, that ever the bitter volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Reproaches of the zeal of the preſent age, ſhould have ſuch a ſcandal or ſtumbling block laid in their way, to harden them in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of their reproaches! as if our Zeal were the Cauſe or Cover of ſuch heinous ſins: Woe to the world becauſe of offences, and woe to them by whom they come!</p>
                     <p n="5">§. 5. 4. But what a tremendous warning is this againſt the ſpirit of unwarrantable <hi>ſeparation,</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. II. His impenitent falſe allegation of witneſſes againſt Infant Baptiſm: <hi>Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c. ſpecially Wickliff.</head>
                     <p n="1">§. 1. I have before ſaid, that I have ſaid ſo much out of Scripture and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for Infants Church-memberſhip and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, to which I have yet ſeen no Anſwer that ſhould ſatisfie an impartial man, either from Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> or any other, that I will not loſe time and labour in replying to their frivolous exceptions. And here I meddle dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly but with the matter of fact, becauſe by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of hiſtory, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would ſeduce the ignorant into the belief of groſs untruths. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who is his firſt witneſs, in his Catalogue, reprinted here in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. And why have we no ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe things ſo oft replyed? 1. That <hi>Tertullians</hi> words prove that Infant-Baptiſm was then in uſe: And it is the matter of <hi>fact</hi> that we are ſearching after? 2. And doth he think that Antichriſt was before <hi>Tertullians</hi> time? 3. The opinion of <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſeemeth not at all to be againſt the Lawfulneſs of Infant Baptiſm, in general; but againſt the eligibleneſs of it in caſe of no apparent danger of death. For I have oft proved that the judgement of that age, and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48465:183"/>
ſome following was, that none ſhould be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be Baptized, or to Baptize their Infants, but they ſhould themſelves be chuſers of the time. For the conceit of the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm to ſalvation, came in afterwards. And when the ſeed of the faithful are Holy, and in Gods Covenant or Promiſe, upon the Parents Mental dedication of them to God, and ſo in a ſtate of ſalvation, no wonder if they were not ſo haſty and peremptory for the ſudden <hi>Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> into the Chriſtian Church ſtate, when they took it to be but the publick ſolemnization of a Covenant, really made and valid before. And as <hi>Nazianzene</hi> is for Infant-Baptiſm (long after) in caſe of danger, but elſe for ſtaying three or four years, till they can ſpeak: ſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſeemeth to prefer delay for ſuch conveniencies as he mentioneth. 4. And if Mr. <hi>D.</hi> doubt of this, let him tell me why he ſaith, <hi>cunctatio uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior.</hi> 5. And giveth the reaſon from the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the Sponſors. 6. And why he alſo perſwadeth the <hi>unmarried</hi> and <hi>young Widdowes</hi> to delay their Baptiſm, till they are <hi>married,</hi> or grow corroborate to continencie, leſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carry them to ſin; And maketh this caſe of the like reaſon with that of Infants. Did he think that it was flatly unlawful for <hi>maids</hi> and <hi>young widdows</hi> to be Baptized? or only <hi>leſs ſafe, and eligible,</hi> except in danger of death? The caſe is plain. 7. And whether he like his other reaſon, <hi>Quid feſtinat innocens ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ad remiſſionem peccatorum?</hi> And whether <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> here do not tell us that he took thoſe Infants that were Baptized to receive thereby ſolemn Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48465:183"/>
of ſin, if they had any ſin? If he thought they had none, we have little reaſon to follow his opinion. 8. Whether his own words plainly ſhew not what I have ſaid of him, that it was (as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and multitudes delayed Baptiſm) for fear of falling after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which they thought moſt dangerous [<hi>ſi qui pondus intelligant Baptiſmi, magis timebunt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutionem quam dilationem: Fides integra ſecura eſt de ſalute</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And <hi>lib. de Anima</hi> Tertullian ſaith, <hi>Apoſtolos ex ſanctificato alterutro ſexu ſanctos procreari ait, tam ex ſeminis praerogativa quam ex inſtitutionis diſciplina—Omnis Anima in Adam cenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, donec in Chriſto recenſeatur:</hi> See the reſt there for Infants <hi>birth holineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. His renewed reproaches of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Antichriſtian doctrine, and his renewed queſtioning whether there were ever ſuch a Council as that at <hi>Carthage</hi> mentioned, are things ſo audacious and groſs that they need no further anſwer. <hi>pag.</hi> 90.</p>
                     <p n="4">§. 4. And his citation of <hi>Auſtin</hi> pag. 94. [<hi>that which had not been inſtituted in Councils,</hi> &amp;c.] is nothing againſt this authority, or to diſprove its Apoſtolical traduction; For it is eaſie for him to ſee, 1. That it was not whether Infants ſhould be Baptized that was the queſtion, but whether it ſhould be done before the eighth day? 2. That this Council was ſo far from <hi>Inſtituting</hi> Infant Baptiſm, that it was never brought into doubt or queſtion among them, but taken as the unqueſtioned practice of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But O that ſuch as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would give over
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48465:184"/>
honouring Antichriſt ſo far (and rejoicing and hardning the Papiſts) as to make ſuch as <hi>Cyprian</hi> teachers of Antichriſtian doctrine; and Antichriſt to have been the Author of Infants Chriſtening before <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertullians</hi> time?

us of a great many of <hi>Wickliffes</hi> words to other purpoſes, and cannot bring one line or word in which he denyeth Infant-Baptiſm: But only 1.

That Baptiſm ſaveth all <hi>ex opere operato</hi>; When he proveth contrarily (of young and old) that where Grace concurreth, it ſaveth, and elſe not. 2. That Infants unbaptized are damned; which in charity he thinks is to be denyed: And what's this againſt their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm?</p>
                     <p n="9">§. 9. Yea <hi>Wickliffe</hi> expreſly aſſerteth Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, <hi>Dialog. li.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 11. I will give the Reader Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> words and his together.</p>

<q>That <hi>Wickliffe</hi> denyed Infant-Baptiſm, I produced ſo much evidence to prove it, from pag. 283. to 289. demonſtrating that he not only <hi>affirmed</hi> that <hi>Believers were the only ſubjects of Baptiſm,</hi> but withal that children are not Sacramentally to be Baptized: and what can be more expreſs evidence in the caſe?</q>

And becauſe ſatisfaction is neceſſary to the blotting out of ſin, and ſatisfaction for ſin cannot be made but by the death of Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, that as many of us as are Baptized into Chriſt, are Baptized into his death.</hi>

                     <p>And in the Twelfth Chapter he proceedeth to anſwer the reſt [<hi>Videtur mihi probabile quod Chriſtus ſatis poſſet ſine lotione hujus, infantes ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiter baptizare, et per conſequens ſalvare: unde dicitur communiter quod triplex eſt baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Eccleſiae, viz. baptiſmus fluminis, baptiſmus ſanguinis, baptiſmus flaminis, et quilibet eorum comparibus ſufficit ad ſalutem—Nec audeo aſſerere quod Infantes occiſi pro Chriſto ſint damnati — Baptiſmus autem flaminis eſt bapt. ſp. ſancti, qui eſt ſimpliciter neceſſarius cuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet homini ſi ſalvetur.

                     <p>[<hi>It ſeemeth to me probable that Chriſt can ſufficiently Baptize Infants ſpiritually without this waſhing, and by conſequence, can ſave them. Whence it is commonly ſaid, that there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Baptiſm of the Church, that is, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm of water, the Baptiſm of blood, and the Baptiſm of the Spirit: And every one of them to the meet, ſufficeth to ſalvation — Nor dare I aſſert that the Infants</hi> Mat. 2. <hi>killed for Chriſt are damned. But the Baptiſm of the ſpirit is the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, which is ſimply neceſſary to every one that he be ſaved. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other two Baptiſms are antecedent ſigns, and ſuppoſitively neceſſary to this third Baptiſm of the ſpirit. Therefore without doubt where that inſenſible baptiſm is, the Baptized perſon is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his ſin: and if that be wanting, let the former be never ſo much preſent, Baptiſm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not the ſoul to ſalvation. Seeing therefore this is inſenſible, and ſo much unknown to us, it ſeemeth to me imprudent preſumption ſo to define mens ſalvation, or damnation by their Baptiſm. But yet we hold without doubting, that Infants rightly Baptized with water, are Baptized with the third Baptiſm,</hi> when (<hi>or</hi> ſeeing) <hi>they have Baptiſmal grace.—For it is not lawful for the faithful, on ſuppoſition of the Baptiſm of the ſpirit, to caſt off the Baptiſm of water, but it is neceſſary to receive it, when the opportunity
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48465:188"/>
of circumſtance is offered. And ſeeing whatever cometh to paſs, doth come to paſs of neceſſity, it maybe ſaid that ſuch a one cannot be ſaved without ſuch Baptiſm.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And to the queſtion of an old woman Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing children in neceſſity, he ſaith,

The Reader muſt pardon the Latine to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or Printer, which may thus be Engliſhed.
<q>[<hi>But we believe</hi> that what old woman ſoever or abject perſon rightly waſheth one with the Sacramental words, God fulfilleth the Baptiſm of the ſpirit.]</q>

                     <p>It ſeemeth that whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> (Mr. <hi>D.'s</hi> firſt witneſs) was for Lay-mens Baptizing in caſe of neceſſity, but not for womens, that <hi>Wickliffe</hi> was for womens alſo.</p>

<q>[And by this I anſwer your third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, granting, that God if he will, may damn ſuch an Infant, and do him no wrong, and if he will he can ſave him: And I dare not define either part: nor am I careful about reputation, or getting evidence in the caſe; but as a dumb man am ſilent, humbly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ignorance, uſing conditional words <note n="*" rend="inter">

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48465:188"/>
whether ſuch an Infant ſhall be ſaved or damned: But I know that whatever God doth in it will be juſt and a work of mercy, to be praiſed of all the faithful: And let not them like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous fools, pour out themſelves, that of their own authority, without knowledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine any thing in that matter.]—<hi>Qui autem dicit,</hi> &amp;c.

But there are ſome things in Parents pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er though lapſed into a <hi>thing Paſt,</hi> for which it is neceſſary by Gods juſt judgement, that ſo it ſhould come to paſs: Therefore he that defineth, that neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents nor people ſo ſinned, that it ſhould ſo come to paſs, doth ſpeak as a <hi>Pie</hi> on the head of his own knowledge.

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48465:189"/>
concludeth contrary to the greater part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that they ſhall have both the <hi>puniſhment of Loſs and Senſe</hi>; and (Note that) that [<hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe eſt peccata originalia hominum eſſe inaequalia, ſicut decedentes in originalibus ſunt propter illa inaequaliter condemnandi: Nam juxta dicta omnes condemnati pro originalibus ſunt condemnandi tam poena damni quam poena ſenſus: ſed impoſſibile eſt quod condemnentur aequaliter omnino illis poenis: ergo relinquitur quod peccata quibus illas poenas demeruerunt, inaequalia ſunt dicenda.</hi>] That is,
<q>[It muſt needs be that the Original ſins of men are unequal, as thoſe that die in Original ſins are unequally to be condemned for them: For as is ſaid, all that are condemned for original ſin are condemned both with the puniſhment of Loſs and of Senſe; But it is impoſſible that they ſhould be damned altogether equally with thoſe pains. Therefore it remaineth that the ſins by which they deſerved thoſe puniſhments be ſaid to be unequal].</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reader, I have been the larger in tranſcribing and tranſlating the words of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> becauſe an Author is not ſo well underſtood by a line or two diſmembred from the reſt, as by whole diſcourſes: and ſo that his ſenſe may be paſt all controverſie: Here it is viſible that <hi>Wickliff</hi> was ſo far from denying Infant-Baptiſm, that 1. He expreſly aſſerteth it, 2. He never ſo much as noteth it for any controverſie, nor maketh any doubt or queſtion about it. 3. Yea he taketh it to be bold preſumption for any to take upon them to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48465:189"/>
know, whether an Infant that dyeth unavoidably unbaptized be ſaved or not, but only ſaith God can do it if he will, and he can damn him. 4. And to thoſe that ſay that the Parents are not in the fault, nor the people, ſeeing they intended his Baptiſm, he ſaith, that many things come to paſs for paſt ſins of Parents, and people, and therefore that cannot be concluded; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after the firſt grace cometh to paſs unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited. 5. And he concludeth that thoſe of them that are damned for original ſin, are puniſhed with pain of loſs and ſenſe, but unequally, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unequal original ſins. 6. But Baptiſm he aſſerteth doth put away all ſin in the rightly Baptized. 7. And that when Infants are right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Baptized with water, they are Baptized with the third Baptiſm having Baptiſmal grace. 8. That it is according to Chriſts rule that Infants be brought to the Church to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                     <p>And now Reader, judge what a ſad caſe poor honeſt ignorant Chriſtians are in, that muſt have their ſouls ſeduced, troubled and led into Love-killing alienations, and ſeparations and cenſures of Chriſts Church, and of their particular bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by ſuch a man as this? And whether they that dare uſe ſouls at this rate, are ſo much better than us, as to be above our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Nay whether thoſe that lately revile the Zeal of diſſenters, as cheriſhing the moſt odious crimes, be not too much ſcandalized and hardened by ſuch dealings? When a man as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

for Chriſt and Baptiſm dare not only print ſuch things, but ſtand to them in a ſecond edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and defend them by a ſecond book, and Rage and be <hi>Confident</hi> in reviling thoſe that tell him of his untruths?</p>
                     <p n="10">§. 10. But he hath many pretended reaſons to prove that <hi>Wickliff</hi> was againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and ſome of them out of the very Chapters which I have tranſcribed:
<q>
                           <hi>1. Saith he, He aſſerted two Sacraments. 2. That believers muſt be baptized in pure water, (And what are theſe to the purpoſe?) 3</hi> That believers are the only ſubjects of Baptiſm <hi>(A groſs untruth) (But he giveth you the words that prove it</hi> [Ideo abſque dubitatione ſi iſte inſenſibilis ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmus affuerit, baptizatus à crimine eſt mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datus: &amp; ſi ille defuerit, quantumcunque eſſent priores, baptiſmus non prodeſt animae ad ſalutem].</q>
I gave you the words before. And did the man think that this is any thing to his purpoſe? <hi>Wickliff</hi> ſaith, [<hi>Water Baptiſm ſaveth no ſoul</hi> (young or old) <hi>without the Baptiſm of the Spirit.</hi>] Therefore ſaith Mr. <hi>D.

But though <hi>Wickliff</hi> called <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm</hi> an <hi>antecedent ſign,</hi> yet moſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Writers I think hold that believers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have by virtue of Gods Covenant the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm of the Spirit, (that is, a ſeed or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to future gracious acts if they live); and that they are in a ſtate of ſalvation before they are Baptized, being the children of the faithful by them dedicated to God, by heart-conſent, and that Baptiſm is but the publick ſolemnization of the ſame Covenant, and delivery of the bleſſings by way of inveſtiture.

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48465:191"/>
                        <hi>Fuller</hi> wrote but about twenty years ago: And muſt one of our neighbours tell us what <hi>Cochleus</hi> ſaith was the opinion of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> when we can read his words our ſelves? 3. But (to make this like its fellows) even this much is untrue, <hi>Fuller</hi> tells us no ſuch thing out of <hi>Cochleus,</hi> but tells us that <hi>Gregory</hi> charged <hi>Wickliff</hi> with eighteen Errors; <hi>Tho.

                     <p>But his direct proof is out of <hi>Waldenſis</hi> ſaying that <hi>Wickliff</hi> ſaith that <hi>children are not ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally to be baptized.</hi>

And <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> who undertaketh to recite <hi>Waldenſis</hi> charge, hath not a word of any ſuch ſenſe. 3. If bitter Papiſts ſo accuſe him, is it therefore true? Judge by his own words. Indeed <hi>Wickliff</hi> held that <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental baptiſm</hi> ſaveth none (young or old) without the baptiſm of the ſpirit; and that it may be ſeparated from it: And hence was the Papiſts noiſe againſt him.</p>

Is <hi>Dallaeus</hi> that hath written ſo large a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Confirmation, an Anabaptiſt? And the Engliſh Nonconformiſts too? 3. But in very deed, Mr. <hi>D.</hi>'s falſhood and <hi>Wickliffs</hi> opinion for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm, may very probably be gathered from that (not fifteenth as he, but) fourteenth <hi>Chapt.</hi> of Confirmation: For, 1. He reprehendeth the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48465:193"/>
Biſhops for adding ſo many Ceremonies to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm, never blaming their baptiſm it ſelf. 2. He argueth againſt confirming children, as ſuperfluous, becauſe the ſpirit is given in baptiſm it ſelf [<hi>&amp; confirmatur ex hoc quod baptizatos no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros dicimus regulariter Spiritum Sanctum acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere eo ipſo quo legitime baptizantur,</hi> that is,
<q>And it is hence confirmed, in that we ſay that our baptized ones do regularly receive the Holy Ghoſt, in that (or by that very thing) that they are lawfully baptized.]</q>

<q>[1.

by <hi>Lanfrank:</hi> but only his accuſations of <hi>Ber.</hi> about Tranſubſtantiation: He never once chargeth him as denying Infant-baptiſm, nor mentioneth it. See, Reader, into what hands the poor ſeduced ones are fallen.</p>
                     <p n="13">§. 13. His ſecond proof is this,
<q>
                           <hi>Caſſandra</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Guitmund</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Averſe</hi> doth affirm that he did deny baptiſm to Little Ones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Caſſander</hi> in neither of his Epiſtles to the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi> mentioneth any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But in his Preface to his Book for Infant-baptiſm to the Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> he ſaith that <hi>Guit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> ſaith [<hi>Quod inter caeteros errores, parvulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum baptiſmum everterit, quem tamen errorem in publicum non produxit, quod eam blaſphemiam ut Guitm. loquitur, ne peſſimorum quidem hominum aures toleraturas ſciret, &amp; in Scripturis ſacris locum ejus erroris tuendi penitus non videret.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Mark here Reader, 1. <hi>Berengarius</hi> is not ſaid to <hi>deny</hi> Infant-baptiſm, but to <hi>overturn</hi> it, (that is, by ſome conſequence it's like.) 2. He did not <hi>publiſh</hi> this his opinion, but held it unpubliſhed: And how then did <hi>Guitmund</hi> know it? 3. Was <hi>Berengarius</hi> as honeſt or as ſtout a man as he is ſuppoſed, and yet when Infants were daily bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, would never ſpeak out his thoughts of the evil of it? 4. Either he baptized Infants himſelf, or not. If he did, was he againſt it then? What a Knave do they make him that ſo ſay? If not, his opinion muſt needs be publiſhed by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, when they whoſe <hi>ears</hi> could not tolerate it,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48465:195"/>
would leſs tolerate the refuſing of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Chriſtning. 5. Was that an honeſt man that would ſecretly hold an opinion which he knew he had no Scripture for? 6. Note that even <hi>Caſſander</hi> there tells us, that indeed the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> though agreeing much with the <hi>Cathariſts,</hi> did yet both approve and uſe Infant-baptiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 671. and that this error ſlept till his age when <hi>Stork</hi> and <hi>Muntzer</hi> raiſed it.</p>
                     <p n="14">§. 14. 2. But what need we ask <hi>Caſſander</hi> what <hi>Guitmund</hi> ſaid? What childiſh play is this? His own book is as common as <hi>Caſſanders in Bibl. Patr. To.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 215. And <hi>Guitmunds</hi> words are theſe
<q>[<hi>Berengarius</hi> opened thoſe things by which he might pleaſe worldly men, that love always (if they may do it unpuniſhed) to ſin: to wit, deſtroying as much as in him lay Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Marriages, and overturning Infants baptiſm: So that in one the Devil by his mouth perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the worſt men that it was lawful to abuſe all women; and in the other [<hi>Caſſato baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Infantiae in profundum omnium malorum, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pote poſtmodum baptizandis, impune ruere: Lege Epiſt.

that is,
<q>[making void the baptiſm of Infancie, they might ruſh unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed into the depth of all evils, as being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to be baptized. Read the Epiſtle of the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> to <hi>H. R.</hi> of <hi>France</hi> againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and there you ſhall find theſe ſame things written, almoſt in the ſame words.]</q>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:48465:196"/>And now, Reader, judge further, 1. Whether this Papiſt who never knew the matter himſelf, and whoſe book ſheweth him a <hi>ſilly bitter</hi> fellow profeſſing to tranſcribe or take his words from the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> who took it from fame, be to he believed in his accuſations of ſuch a man, when <hi>Lanfrank</hi> that diſputed with him before the Pope, nor the Pope himſelf, nor any of the many Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods that examined him, and conſtrained him to recant, ever mention ſuch a thing? Were theſe Perſecutors think you blind or merciful herein? 2. If he be to be believed in this, why not in the firſt article, of the lawfulneſs of abuſing all women commonly? 3. Do not the very words [<hi>quantum in ſe,</hi> and <hi>everterit</hi>] and [<hi>caſſato ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmate</hi>] open the caſe, that malice gathered this as a forced conſequence only of ſome words of <hi>Berengarius?</hi> It is like becauſe he defined a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to their diſlike, which <hi>Lanfrank</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him for.</p>
                     <p>And ſo ſottiſh a fellow was this <hi>Guitmund</hi> that his fellow Papiſts are put to diſown him for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their Euchariſtical Hoſt cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or putrifie, or be eaten by Mice, or any Bruits, but only ſeemeth ſo to be: <hi>ib. p.</hi> 230. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</p>

                     <p n="1">§. 1. IN his Reply <hi>p.</hi> 108. he reaſſumeth this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny. And firſt he reciteth their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to prove it: as if he wanted matter to fill his Book, not having one word againſt Infant-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm in that which is by himſelf recited: But it muſt be inferred, if ſuch a man as this be to be believed, becauſe faith is required (in the adult, and them that Covenant for Infants) and becauſe Traditions and Inventions are diſclaimed, and ſuch like. Had the man dealt by the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> but as he doth by me, when citing my words he will prove that my <hi>words</hi> are for him while I am againſt him, (as if I underſtood not what I ſay) it had been much leſs. But to face down the world that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> denied Infant-baptiſm for ſuch ſilly reaſons, is intolerable. It is not worth the labour to ſhew him how the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants agree with the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in all the points where he feigneth a diſagreement, <hi>p.</hi> 112.</p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. Yet doth the man break out into admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that he <hi>having with exactneſs given a particular account of all thoſe Confeſſions word

for word, — and proved by ample demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> 1. <hi>That none of them were extant till the ſixteenth Century,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wonderful! That ſuch a man ſhould talk of <hi>exactneſs</hi> and <hi>demonſtration.</hi> Stay Reader a little, and tell me whether it call not for ſhame and tears that one ſuch Book ſhould be written by a Chriſtian?

                        <hi>Anſw. Berengarius</hi> is not uſed to be reckoned as one of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> but if you will ſo call him, I have confuted the ſlander of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                     <p n="5">§. 5. It is true that ſome Papiſts do raile at the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> with abominable calumnies, as guilty of the moſt odious hereſies, [denying the reſurrection, and the ſalvation of Infants, aſſerting the common uſe of women, and abundance ſuch:] Inſomuch that it is become a hard queſtion whether really there were any ſuch people, or whether all were ſlanders: and among other things they charge them with denying Infant-baptiſm. And the Authors go ſo much on fame, and ſhew ſo much falſhood, that many think that all are ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But Biſhop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher (de ſucceſ. Eccl.)</hi> and ſome others bring many teſtimonies to prove that
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48465:199"/>
in that age there were abundance of <hi>Manichees</hi> that came into <hi>Lombardie,</hi> and from thence came into the country of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>; and that for their ſakes the Papiſts accuſed the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of all theſe villanies and hereſies with Anabaptiſm, as if they had been all of a mind. And though I confeſs that the horrid lies of abundance of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius</hi> and other ſuch, and ſome experiments in this age, have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men occaſion to queſtion whether all were not meer forgeries, and that nothing is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that they ſaid of thoſe times; yet I am ready to think that there were ſome ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they deſcribe that were againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and for common uncleanneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Infants ſalvation and baptiſm, even ſuch <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi> as aforeſaid: Not that I think it any whit ſtrange that fame among ſuch world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecutors ſhould belie others as much as this comes to; but becauſe of the hiſtorical reports of ſuch <hi>Manichees</hi> recited by <hi>

And that they falſly took the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to have been of the <hi>Manichees</hi> mind, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving among them, is all the cloak that any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable charity can afford to thoſe old ones that falſly accuſed them: And to the later ſlanderers (<hi>Couſſordus, Gretſer,</hi> &amp;c.) this will be no cloak, much leſs to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> if in his zeal for his Sect and way, he will own the ſlanders of blinded Papiſts, when he crieth them down himſelf, and hath had time and means to know their calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>

                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:48465:200"/>To all this, let the Reader add but the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the groſs contradictions of their accuſers againſt each other, (yea the ſame Author as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Couſſardus</hi> ſaying one thing, and as publiſhed by <hi>Gretſer</hi> ſaying the contrary, I mean <hi>Raynerius.</hi>) And let him conſider of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Vignier</hi> concerning an old Copy of their Doctrine ſhewed to the great and excellent Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of <hi>France, Mich.

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48465:200"/>
that brought in the errors after mentioned by him, which ſwarmed in <hi>Bernards</hi> daies; And that this Hereſie bred them that were called <hi>Cathariſts,</hi> a name belonging to one of the three ſects of <hi>Manichees</hi>: but in <hi>France</hi> they were called <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> from the place, and that it was to theſe <hi>Manichean</hi> and <hi>Priſcillian</hi> errours, that they added the denyal of Infant-Baptiſm. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And for the ſurmiſe of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> he taketh the word of <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Abbot Cluniacenſis</hi>: ſo that <hi>Caſſander</hi> doth but what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> doth, even report <hi>Cluniacenſi.</hi> 4.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſeldom read an Author whoſe Proofs are liker one another: 1. Why muſt we be told what Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> ſaith of the acts of an old Council, as eaſily known by us as by him? 2. Reader, there is not the leaſt
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48465:201"/>
proof of any ſuch matter medled with in that Council: <hi>Peter Crab</hi> doth not ſo much as name that Council: <hi>Binius</hi> only tells you that the <hi>Acts of the Council are not extant,</hi> but that <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſpergenſis,</hi> and <hi>Otto Friſingenſis</hi> give us ſome account of what they did, whoſe words have not a ſyllable about any ſuch ſubject, but only that they condemned the Schiſmaticks who adhered to <hi>Peter Leo,</hi> an <hi>Antipope.</hi> 3. But how came Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> ſo to miſtake? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe Papers of Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> were poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſhreds, which whether he would have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we cannot tell. But that which he ſaith, is that there were thirty Canons lately publiſhed as that Council's, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth as falſe: And ſeeing I never ſaw that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery I cannot ſay whether any ſuch thing be in it, which <hi>Prideaux's</hi> words recite: But it muſt be from that or from nothing. And is this a good proof for <hi>Prideaux</hi> to tell you what a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged writing ſaith, which <hi>Crab</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> eject or take for falſe? 4. But what if that Council had ſo accuſed <hi>Bruis</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi> are they to be (believed of them? But there is no ſuch thing proved.</p>
                     <p n="8">§. 8. His next proof is from <hi>Bernard,</hi> of whom I need to ſay no more than what <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and others have oft ſaid, that it was the foreſaid <hi>Manichean</hi> Hereticks called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thariſts</hi> that <hi>Bernard</hi> deſcribeth by the name of <hi>Apoſtolick.</hi> And that he went by fame (as <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dienſis</hi> did) which falſly accuſed the <hi>Albigenſes</hi>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:48465:201"/>
among them as guilty of the ſame hereſies; And that the ſame <hi>Bernard</hi> accuſeth thoſe that he ſpake of, of other heinous things; If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from him that the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were guilty of the one, you have the ſame teſtimony that they were guilty of the other.</p>
                     <p n="9">§. 9. His next proof is the report of a late Papiſt <hi>Joſ. Vicecomes, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Whom he alſo after mentioneth in his Reply, who as truly numbreth <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Infant-Baptiſm.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Not a word of Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> books is cited to prove this, but Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his Review. And muſt we know of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> what Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> held? No wonder then if I and the world muſt learn what I hold my ſelf, and what I have written, from ſuch as Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tombes.</hi> And why not alſo from all the reſt that have written againſt me? 2.

had no other means to know what theſe two men and their followers held, than what we and others have as well as he. You muſt give us elder proofs than this. 3. And if it were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by him or proved by others, it were no proof that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> denyed Infant-Baptiſm; but it would only follow that <hi>Bruis</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> were <hi>Manichees</hi> and not <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be the miſtake of their later accuſers at leaſt.</p>

Once for all, It is uſual with Writers to charge the Anabaptiſts as following the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing, but not in denying Infant-baptiſm: For the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> baptized again both Infants and adult. And it is like this deceived this temerarious man.</p>

                     <p n="3">§. 3. Thirdly he repeateth his ſtupendious ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Auſtin as with much zeal and fury in many Books oppoſing the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>for denying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm</hi>; of which in them all (as far as I can find) he hath not one ſyllable, but the clear contrary, as is proved by me.</p>

But this time-robber hath tempted me once more to peruſe <hi>Eckbertus</hi> the Abbot, and to read his Serm. 7. and 8. and where-ever this ſubject is his theam, and I find not one ſyllable of any ſuch matter in him of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Donatiſts</hi> or <hi>Novatians</hi>; ſuch a man have we now to deal with.</p>
                     <p>§. The reſt of his recitals are not worthy the recital: The Anſwer before given is ſufficient. Only I ſay again that his contempt of ſo full a teſtimony as the Decree of a Council at that time [<hi>for receiving without rebaptizing ſuch as the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>baptized in Infancy</hi>] cited by <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> as a certain proof, is a proof that there is worſe than a weak judgement in fault.</p>

                     <p>Here, 1. See how he feareth not to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the dead by this <hi>hearſay?</hi> No wonder if by this ſort of men I my ſelf am by backbiting ſo frequently traduced, and ſaid <hi>to Preach and Print</hi> that which never was in my mouth or books or thoughts?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Should one ask him whom he heard this from, do you think we ſhould get a ſatisfying anſwer? No one is here named.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is poſſible Biſhop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> upon the coming forth of my Aphoriſms (which had many crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and many quarrelled at it more than there was cauſe,) might fear any thing that looked like unuſual.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="405" facs="tcp:48465:210"/>4. But I ask the Reader whether this be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable report, when he underſtandeth,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That I was for ſome weeks familiar with the Biſhop, and he never ſpake a ſyllable to me of ſuch importance. 2. That when Doct. <hi>Kendal</hi> and I were together with him, and our queſtion was what was <hi>Auguſtins</hi> jugement of <hi>Redemption, Perſeverance,</hi> and ſome other things, he expreſly averred that my Aſſertion in all thoſe was the truth. 3. But I imagine this following might be the occaſion of the report. Dr. <hi>Kendal</hi> had ſome acquaintance with and intereſt in the ſaid Arch-Biſhop, and he having written two diſputations againſt me, I had anſwered the firſt, and had drawn up part of the anſwer to the ſecond: But Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> and Dr. <hi>Kendal</hi> deſired me to meet at Biſhop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers</hi> lodging in order to the ending of our difference. There the Biſhop motioned that we ſhould promiſe to write againſt each other no more: which we did, and I caſt by what I had begun. But yet Doct. <hi>K.</hi> after in a Latine Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe broke that promiſe (which occaſioned my verſes in the end of my Diſpute of the Object of Juſtifying Faith againſt Mr. <hi>Warner,</hi> which ſome underſtood not.) Now it is not unlikely that the Biſhop might ſay that if Dr. <hi>K.</hi> and I perſiſted in that Diſpute, it would but trouble the Church. I am ſure he ſaid no more to me, nor ſo much.</p>
                     <p>As for Mr. <hi>D.</hi>'s judgement, I deſerve not the honour he giveth me, but indeed I think that of moſt men that I have had to deal with in that kind, he is one of the unfitteſt to make himſelf a
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48465:211"/>
Judge, <hi>who is fit to meddle with Controverſie,</hi> or to judge <hi>himſelf</hi> much fitter than me. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his knowledge hath coſt him much leſs <hi>time and ſtudy</hi> than mine hath done me; And if his advantage be in greater <hi>illumination of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as I ſeriouſly profeſs to fear leſt I ſhould want it, for my manifold ſins againſt the Spirit, and therefore have cauſe moſt earneſtly to beg for it; ſo I could wiſh that he had better manifeſted it, than in theſe two Voluems he hath done: at leaſt by an ordinary humane friendſhip to hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth. For my part I had never more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed any thing in this cauſe, if my ſenſe of the hurt and danger of their Separations and Diviſions of Chriſtians, and deſtruction of Love and Peace, had not moved me much more, than any great zeal againſt bare rebaptizing, in it ſelf conſidered, eſpecially if hypothetically done.</p>

            <p n="1">§. 1. SInce the writing of this, I have peruſed <hi>Smaragdus, Peter Abbas Cluniacenſis,</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> which were not before at hand. And I ſhall give you a true account of their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As for <hi>Smaragdus,</hi> I never before read him, but on this occaſion getting his expoſition on the Epiſtles and Goſpels I find that there is a great agreement indeed among Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> witneſſes, that in his citations he is ſtill like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

pure and innocent Infancie, the Church their chaſt Mother doth by the grace of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm beget.]</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. And on <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. in <hi>Aſcenſ.</hi> fol. 101. [<hi>Cum autem dicatur, Qui vero non crediderit condemnabitur, quid hic dicimus de parvulis, qui per aetatem adhuc credere non valent? Nam de majoribus nulla quaeſtio eſt: In Eccleſia ergo ſalvatoris per alios parvuli credunt, ſicut ex ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is ea quae illis in baptiſmo remittuntur peccata traxerunt.</hi>] That is, [<hi>He that believeth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But when it is ſaid, But he that believeth not ſhall be condemned, what ſay we here to little ones who by their age are not yet able to believe? For of the elder there is no queſtion. Therefore in the Church of our Saviour, little ones believe by others, as from others they have drawn thoſe ſins which in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm are forgiven to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>And in</hi> ſab. Pentecoſt. <hi>in</hi> Act. 19. <hi>fol.</hi> 103, 104. <hi>having at large opened how Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens were inſtructed before Baptiſm, and deſcribed approvedly their Ceremonies, of croſſing, breathing on them, exorcizing, ſalt, the Creed to be recited and underſtood, he addeth, [Quia ergo Parvuli, necdum ratione utentes, haec minime capere poſſunt, oportet ut cum ad imtelligibilem aetatem pervenerint, doceantur &amp; fidei ſacramenta &amp; confeſſionis myſteria, ut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raciter credant, &amp; diligenti cura cuſtodiant confeſſionem ſuam.

Nec immerito: dignum eſt ut qui alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum peccatis obnoxii ſunt, aliorum etiam confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione, per miniſterium baptiſmatis, remiſſionem originalium percipiant peccatorum.</hi>] That is [<hi>But ſeeing little ones that have not yet the uſe of reaſon, cannot receive theſe things, it is meet that when they come to age of underſtanding they be taught both the Sacraments of faith and the myſtery of confeſſion, that they may truly believe, and by diligent care may keep their confeſſion: And not undeſervedly: It is meet (or worthy) that they who are obnoxious to (or by) others ſins, by others confeſſion alſo ſhould by the myſtery of Baptiſm, receive the pardon of original ſins.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Yet it's true that this ſame Author doth oft call for confeſſion from the adult, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men not to truſt to meer outward bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, as may be ſeen on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. fol. 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he could reconcile this to Infant-Baptiſm, though Mr. <hi>D.</hi> cannot. See him further fol. 85. <hi>c.</hi> in <hi>Math.</hi> 28. and fol. 85. in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> fol. 84. <hi>&amp;</hi> fol. 19. in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. II. As to <hi>Pet. Cluniacenſis</hi> (another Abbot near the ſame time, and contemporary with <hi>Bernard</hi>) he is the moſt plauſible of all Mr. <hi>D.'s</hi> witneſſes, as againſt two men, <hi>Pet. Bruis,</hi> and <hi>Henry:</hi> But, 1. Fol. 1. Epiſt, 1. he writeth Twenty years after <hi>Peters</hi> ſowing his doctrine. 2. And though <hi>Henry</hi> lived in his time, yet fol. 2. he ſaith, [<hi>Sed quia eum ita ſentire vel praedicare, nondum mihi plene fides facta eſt, differo reſponſionem quouſque &amp; horum
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48465:213"/>
quae dicuntur indubitatam habeant certitudinem</hi>] that is, (having called <hi>Henry the heir of</hi> Peters <hi>wickedneſs, who rather changed than mended his Devilliſh doctrine</hi>)
<q>But becauſe I have not yet teſtimony fully credible (or am not ſure) that he ſo thinketh, and preacheth, I delay my anſwer till I can have undoubted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the things reported].</q>
By which it is plain that he knew neither of them, but went by that ſame, which commonly then ſlandered them.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. 3. And in his firſt Propoſal fol. 7. (of <hi>Hoffmeiſters Edit.</hi>) he reciteth the words ſuppoſed to be theirs, in which they deny as much the <hi>Salvation</hi> as the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Ex his domini verbis Mar.</hi> 16. <hi>aperte monſtrant, nullum niſi crediderit, &amp; baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus fuerit, hoc eſt, niſi Chriſtianam fidem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buerit &amp; baptiſmum perceperit, poſſe ſalvari: Nam non alterum horum, ſed utrumque pariter ſalvat: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Infantes, licet à vobis baptizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quia tamen credere, obſtante aetate, non poſſunt, nequaquam ſalvantur.</hi>] So that it is the ſalvation of any Infants that they principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here deny; accounting Baptiſm needful to ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8.
<q>And fol. 8. He addeth their next charge that <hi>fama vulgavit, fame reported,</hi> that they wholly believed not Chriſt, Prophets, or Apoſtles, the Old or New Teſtament.</q>
               <hi>Sed quia fallaci rumorum monſtro non facile aſſenſum praebere debeo (maxime cum quidam vos totum

            <p n="9">§. 9. Now I leave it to the Reader, among many uncertainties, which of theſe he will believe moſt probable: 1. That all the parties were ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: 2. Or that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> were ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by occaſion of the mixed <hi>Manichees,</hi> or by the vulgar lying levity or Popiſh malice. 3. Or whether <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> were guilty as ſome now, though the reſt were not. 4. Or whether they and the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> really denyed all Infants ſalvation and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm (their very pretended words being cited.) 5. Or whether they were ſlandered as to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſalvation, and not as to their Baptiſm. 6. Or whether all this roſe not from their denying the ſalvation of the children of all the wicked, as <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the Baptiſm of the Prieſt, and their refuſing to bring their own children to be Baptized by ſuch Prieſts, and their telling the wicked at age, that their Infant-Baptiſm would not ſave them. Believe which of theſe you find moſt cauſe.</p>

               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:48465:214"/>§. 10. III. As for <hi>Bernard,</hi> 1. Though a holy man, yet his conceit that Papal unity was neceſſary, and that the Diſſenters cauſed confuſion, tranſported him with ſuch prejudice againſt them, as we have now againſt the vileſt Sects. 2. He was acquainted with <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> and might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him. 3. He took things on truſt as he did. 4. He chargeth even the ſecret hereticks that he writes againſt, as holding it unlawful to ſwear, and yet lawful to forſwear, rather than reveal their caſe: Serm. 65. 5. And that in ſecret they are reported to commit filthy wickedneſs, not to be named. 6. That he heareth that ſome of them reject <hi>Pauls</hi> writings, and the Old Teſtament. 7. That they lived ſcandalouſly with Women: and he talketh as if it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for men and women to dwell together, and yet to be chaſt. 8. Yet ſheweth that he moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably ſuſpected them, ſaying, [<hi>Si fidem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terroges, nihil Chriſtianius; ſi converſationem, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil irreprehenſibilius; &amp; quae loquitur, factis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: Videas hominem in teſtimonium ſuae fidei frequentare Eccleſiam, honorare preſbyteros, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre munus ſuum, confeſſionem facere, ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis communicare (and did they deny Infant-Baptiſm then?)

Serm. 66. he chargeth them for being <hi>againſt Marriage,</hi> yea that <hi>they took filthineſs to be only in having Wives.</hi> 10. And with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to <hi>Marry,</hi> they joyned <hi>abſtaining</hi> from <hi>meats:</hi> and ſo holding deviliſh doctrine: But that ſome allowed Marriage only to Virgins, but not ſecond Marriages: That they abhorred Milk, and all that was made of it, and all that was procreated by generation, and that (<hi>de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſania Manichaei.</hi>) That they held themſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the Church, and derided them that Baptized Infants: (yet he himſelf writes large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ep. ad Hug. de Sancto Victore,</hi> for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of perſons that have faith, and die unba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized through neceſſity; alledging <hi>Ambroſe, Auſtin, Cyprian</hi>; And concludeth Infants ſaved by others faith, as they were guilty by others ſin.) 11. In <hi>Epiſt. ad Hildefonſum</hi> he ſaith, of <hi>Henry</hi> by name, that he was an Apoſtate, that made a trade of preaching, to live by in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and what money he could get of ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and women more than found him food, he ſpent in playing at dice, or other more filthy uſes: that after his daies applauſe by the people he was

found at night with whores: that he thus left every where ſuch a ſtink behind him, that he could come but once to a place, naming many Cities.</p>
            <p>Now let the Reader judge if <hi>Bernard</hi> be to be believed what a man this was: If not, what his teſtimony is worth.</p>
