            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>POlyeuctus</hi> and <hi>Nearchus</hi> were two Cavaleirs straightly tyed together in Amity; they lived in the year 250. under the Empire of <hi>Deciu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> their aboad was in <hi>Melitene,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City of <hi>Armenia,</hi> their Religion different, <hi>Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was a Christian, and <hi>Polyeuctus</hi> following yet the Sect of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but having all the qualities worthy of a Christian, and a great inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so: The Emperour having caused an Edict to be published very rigorous against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, this Publication gave a great trouble to <hi>Nearchus;</hi> not for feare of the punishments wherewith he was threatned, but for the apprehension which he had, that their Amity might fuffer some separation or coldness by this Edict, seeing the punishments that were proposed therin to those of the Religion, and the Honours promised to those of the contrary party; He conceived therat so great a displeasure, that his Friend perceived it, and having obliged him to tell him the cause therof, he took the occasion to open his heart unto him. Fear not, said he, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours


<pb facs="tcp:48681:3"/>
Edict should dis-unite us: I saw this night the CHRIST which you adore, he took from me a filthy Robe, to apparel me with a Luminous one, and made me mount upon a winged Horse to follow him. This Vision hath resolved me wholly to do that which I long time meditated: the name of a CHRISTIAN is only wanting to me, and you your selfe as often as you have spoken unto me of your great MESSIAS, might have observed that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hearkned unto you with respect, and when you read unto me his Life and Doctrine, I alwaies admired the Sanctity of his Actions and Discourses. O <hi>Nearchus</hi> if I thought not my self unworthy to come unto him without being initiated with his Mysteries, and to have received the Grace of his Sacraments, how you should behold the Ardor break forth, which I have to dye for his Glory and the support of his Eternall Truths! <hi>Nearchus</hi> having cleered him of the scruple wherin he was, by the example of the good Thief, who in a moment meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heaven, though he had not received Baptisme; presently our Martyr full of a holy Fervour, took the Emperours Edict, spit upon't, and tore it in peices, which he cast unto the Wind, and seeing the Idols which the people carried upon the Altars to adore them, he snatch'd them away from those that bare them, brake them against the ground, and trod them under his feet, astonishing all the


<pb facs="tcp:48681:3"/>
World, and his friend likewise, by the heat of that Zeal, which he expected not.</p>
            <p>His Father-in-Law <hi>Felix,</hi> who had the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Commission to persecute the Christians, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen himself what his Son-in-law had done, seized with grief to see the hope and prop of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily lost, endeavoured to shake his constancy, first by fair words, then by threatnings, lastly by stroaks, which he made his Executioners to give him on the face: But not able to prevail herewith, for a last attempt he sent unto him his Daughter <hi>Paulina,</hi> to see if her tears had not more power upon the Spirit of a Husband, then the Artifices and Rigours had had: He gained nothing by that, on the contrary, seeing that his firmness had converted many <hi>Pagans,</hi> he condemned him to loose his head; this Sentence was executed presently, and the holy Martyr with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other Baptisme then of his blood, went to take possession of the Glory which God hath promised to those that renounce themselves for the love of him.</p>
            <p>See in few words the true story of <hi>Polyeuctes</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom; the dream of <hi>Paulina,</hi> the love of <hi>Severus,</hi> the effectuall Baptisme of <hi>Polyeuctes,</hi> the Sacrifice for the Emperours Victory, the dignity of <hi>Felix,</hi> whom I make Governour of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the death of <hi>Nearchus,</hi> the conversion of <hi>Felix,</hi> and of <hi>Paulina,</hi> are the Inventions and Embellishments of the Stage, only the Victory of the Emperour against the <hi>Persians</hi>

hath some foundation in the History, and without seeking for other Authors, it is reported by <hi>Monsieur CoÃ«ffoteau</hi> in his Roman History; but he sayes not, neither that he imposed tribute on them, nor that he sent to make Sacrifices of thanks in <hi>Armenia.</hi>

                     <l>Like them; we suffer likewise in all places</l>
                     <l>All kind of gods, their God only excepted:</l>
                     <l>All the Aegyptian Monsters haue their Temple</l>
                     <l>In <hi>Rome;</hi> our predecessors, as they lik'd,</l>
                     <l>Made a god of a man, and their blood with us</l>

                     <l>Of so much Apothaesis, the effect</l>
                     <l>Is very doubtfull of these Metamorphoses:</l>
                     <l>The Christians have but one God, absolute Master</l>
                     <l>Of all, whose only will doth execute</l>
                     <l>What he resolves, but if I durst to speake</l>
                     <l>Between us what I think, ours very often,</l>
                     <l>Me thinks, agree together very ill,</l>
                     <l>And should their anger crush me 'fore thine eyes,</l>
                     <l>I must speak this, we have too many of them</l>
                     <l>To be true gods. Perhaps these publick faiths</l>
                     <l>Are but inventions of wise Polyticks,</l>
                     <l>To keep the People under, and to awe them,</l>
                     <l>And to establish their power on their weakness.</l>
                     <l>Lastly the manners of the Christians</l>
                     <l>Are innocent, vertues do flourish with them,</l>
                     <l>Vices appear not; never an Adulterer,</l>
                     <l>A Traytor, Drunkard, Murtherer, or Thief</l>
                     <l>Is seen amongst them, there is nothing else</l>
                     <l>But love and charity, they live together</l>
                     <l>Like Brothers, they pray for us that do persecute them;</l>
                     <l>And have we ever since the time we first</l>
