            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Foraſmuch as by Our Royal Prerogative, We have power to eſtabliſh, or alter the matter of Coyn, either Native or Forraign within Our Dominions, from time to time, as We ſhall find fit for the good of Our Subjects; and Our Royal Anceſtors having been in conſtant uſe to raiſe and exalt the extrinſick value of the Coyn of this Kingdom, according as the Neighbouring Kingdoms and States have done their Standarts; and in ſome meaſure, to bear ſuch a proportion with Our Neighbours, as that the Coyn of this Kingdom might not be exported: And whereas the value of the ounce of Coyned Silver hath been raiſed from time to time, as particularly in the year 1591. the value of the ounce of Coyned Silver was appointed to be fourty two ſhilling <hi>Scots,</hi> being of eleven Denier fine, which continued from that year to the year 1691, and was then raiſed to three Pounds ten Pennies, and two ſixth parts, and which has continued ever ſince at that value: albeit in the Neighbouring Kingdoms and States, the ounce of Coyned Silver is valued conſiderably above the ſame, which has been one great occaſion of the exporting of the greateſt part of the Stock of Our own Coyn, and whereof Merchandiſe has been, and is ſtill made; and the ſame ſpecies melted down by forraign Mints and Goldſmiths, and imported again in forraign ſpecies, much below Our own Coyn, both in weight and fineneſs, whereby Our Authority has been contemned, Our People cheated and abuſed, and the Trade and Commerce of this Kingdom highly prejudged; and if the ſame be not timouſly remeided, the remnant of the Stock of Our own Coyn will in a ſhort time be carryed out, and nothing left but forraign ſpecies of baſer Monies. And ſome of the moſt conſiderable of the Merchants of this Our Kingdom, having made their application to Our Privy Council, and propoſed as a fit expedient, that Our four Merk peices might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be current proportionally to the intrinſick value thereof, and the beſt of the forraign Current Coyn; who having had the ſame u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nder ſerious conſideration, and having received from the Officers of Our Mint, an exact account of the intrinſick value thereof, and of all other forraign ſpecies of Coyn, tollerated to be current; and finding, that at the rate of the ounce of Silver now Current in other Countreys, it is fit that Our Coyn be in ſome proportion with theirs in the extrinſick value. We therefore, with the Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, do ordain and appoint, that in time coming, the ounce of Our own Moneys ſhall be in value, three Pounds four Shillings <hi>Scots</hi> Money: and to that effect, do ordain, that the four Merk pieces, which are now current at fifty three ſhillings four pennies, ſhall hereafter be current at fifty ſix ſhillings, and the inferiour ſpecies of that Coyn, <hi>viz.</hi> the two Merk, Merk, Half merk, and Fourty-penny-piece proportionably. And whereas it is moſt juſt, that now ſeing we have advanced the value of Our Coyn, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Merchants ought to have enccuragement to bring in their Bulzeon with greater chearfulneſs, We do ordain, that whereas they did receive for each ounce of Silver, payed in by them, as Bulzeon of eleven denier fine, fifty five Shillings nine Pennies <hi>Scots;</hi> the Maſter of the Mint is now to pay out to them, for every ounce of eleven denier fine, given in by them as Bulzeon, fifty eight Shillings <hi>Scots.</hi> And ordains all forraign ſpecies of Coyn to be current as formerly; And that theſe Preſents be Printed, and Publiſhed at the Mercat Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other places needful, that none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ignorance.</p>
