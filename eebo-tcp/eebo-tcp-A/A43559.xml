         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He occasion which induc'd me to the
writing of this Discourse hath been
already touched at in our <hi>general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
and shall be shewn thee more at large
in the following Preamble or <hi>Introduction.</hi>
Let it suffice thee now to know, that it was
done on an occasion <hi>really</hi> given, and not in
<hi>supposition</hi> only, the better to bring in the
Design which I have in hand; and that it
gave such satisfaction to the <hi>Party</hi> for whose
<pb facs="tcp:61736:3"/>
sake it was undertaken, that it was thought
fit by some to have it publisht for the Use
of others. But being published by a faulty
and imperfect Copy, I caus'd it presently
to be call'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in; not willing it should goe
abroad (though without my Name) till it
were able in some measure to defend it
self, if not to justifie the Authour. Being
now set upon a resolution, which God
bless me me in, of vindicating this poor
Church (as far at least as in me is) in her
Forms of Worship, her Government and
establisht Patrimony, together with the
Times and Places destinate to her Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
I have thought good to place this
Tractate in the Front, as a <hi>Praecognitum</hi> or
necessary <hi>Manuduction</hi> unto all the rest. <hi>The
way and manner of the Reformation of the
Church of</hi> England <hi>declared and justified,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but give a good Relish unto all that
follows, being no other then the Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
parts and branches of that <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
If thou art satisfied in this, it will
be a faire <hi>Omen</hi> to me, that the rest may
not prove unwelcome. And that thou mayst
<pb facs="tcp:61736:3"/>
peruse it with the greater chearfulness; I
will not keep thee longer in the Entrance
of it; it being no good Husbandry to
waste that Friend in petit Matters, whom
we endeavour to preserve for nobler fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
And so fare thee well.</p>

you are never better welcome then when you
bring your doubts and scruples along with you,
for by that means you put me to the studying of
some point or other, whereby I benefit my self, if
not profit you. And I remember at the time of your last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>England,</hi> telling me you were well assured that her Doctrine
was most true and orthodox, her Government conform to the

(as you said) in the waies and means by which this
<hi>Church</hi> proceeded in her <hi>Reformation,</hi> alledging, that you had

it be a dangerous and invidious subject (as the times now
are) yet for your sake, and for the Truths, and for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> which seem to suffer much in that <hi>Popish</hi>

not to say any thing to the point of <hi>Right,</hi> whether or not
the <hi>Parliament</hi> may lawfully meddle in such matters as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

they proceed in their Constitutions, and then declare what
was acted by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in that <hi>Reformation:</hi> In which, I shall begin
with the ejection of the Pope, and setling the <hi>Supremacy</hi> in the
Crown Imperial of this Realm; descending next to the <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Scriptures into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, the Reformation of
the Church in <hi>Doctrinals</hi> and <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and to proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Power of making <hi>Canons</hi> for the well ordering of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,

of these points, I doubt not but it will appear unto you,
that till these late busie and unfortunate Times, in which every
man intrudeth on the Priestly Function, the Parliaments did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all either in making <hi>Canons,</hi> or in matters <hi>Doctrinall,</hi> or in
<hi>Translation</hi> of the Scriptures: next that that lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le which they
did in reference to the <hi>Formes</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> of Worship, was no more
then the inflicting of some <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>legal</hi> penalties on such as did
neglect the one, or not conform unto the other, having been first
digested and agreed upon in the <hi>Clergy</hi> way: and finally that those
Kings and Princes before remembred, by whose Authority the
Parliaments did that little in those <hi>Formes</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> did not act
any thing in that kinde themselves, but what was warranted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them by the word of God and the example of such godly and
religious Emperors and other Christian Kings and Princes, as
flourished in the happiest times of Christianity. This is the sum
of my design, which I shall follow in the order before laid down:
assuring you that when you shall acquaint me with your other
scruples, I will endevour what I can for your satisfaction.</p>

                  <p>I have the longer staid on these publick Formes, partly because
not obvious unto every eye; but specially to let you see by what
Authority the Clergy are to be assembled in their <hi>Convocations,</hi> and
what it is which makes their Canons and Conclusions binding,
unto all those which send them thither, or intrust them there.
Their calling by the Kings Authority makes their meeting law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
which else were liable to exceptions and disputes in Law, and
possibly might render them obnoxious to some grievous penalties;
and so would their continuance too after the writ was issued for
their <hi>Dissolution.</hi> As on the contrary their breaking or <hi>dissolving</hi> of
their own accord, would make them guilty of contempt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently

whom they represented in the point of <hi>Property,</hi> imposing on them

And they enjoyed this power to the very day in which they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the <hi>submission,</hi> which before we spake of. For by this self-au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(if I may so call it) they imposed and levied that great

By this the Will and Testament of <hi>William Tracie</hi> of <hi>Toddington</hi>
was condemned as <hi>scandalous and heretical,</hi> and his body taken up

anno</hi> 1532.</p>
                  <p>But this power being thought too great or inconsistent at least
with the Kings Design touching his divorce, the Clergy were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
unto such a straight by the degrees and steps which you find
in the following Section, as to submit their power unto that of
the King, and to promise in <hi>verbo sacerdotii,</hi> that they would do and
enact nothing in their <hi>Convocations</hi> without his consent. And to
the gaining of this point, he was pressed the rather, in regard of
a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> then presented to Him by the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> in
which they shewed themselves aggrieved, that the Clergy of this
Realm should act Authoritatively, and supremely in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi>
and they in <hi>Parliament</hi> do nothing, but as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and ratified by the <hi>Royal Assent.</hi> Which notwithstanding,
though this <hi>Submission</hi> brought down the <hi>Convocation</hi> to the same
Level with the Houses of Parliament; yet being made unto the
King in his single person, and not as in conjunction with his
Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> it neither brought the <hi>Convocation</hi> under
the command of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> nor rendred them obnoxious to the
power thereof. That which they did in former times of their
self-authority (in matters which concerned the Church) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings consent co-operating and concurring with them,
the same they did and might do in the Times succeeding, the
Kings Authority and Consent being superadded, without the
help and midwisery of an Act of Parliament, though sometimes
that Authority was made use of also, for binding of the subject
under <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Legal</hi> penalties, to yeeld obedience and
conformity to the Churches Orders. Which being the true
state of the present businesse, it makes the clamour of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
the more unreasonable; but then withall it makes it the
more easily answered. <hi>Temporal punishments</hi> inflicted on the refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory

                        </gap> of the Bishop of</hi> Rome. By which it was enacted, <hi>That if any
person should extoll the Authority of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>he should incur the

should bejudged High Treason.</hi> But this was also usher'd in, by the
determination first, and after by the practice of all the Clergy. For
in the year 1534, which was two yeares before the passing of this
Act, the King had sent this Proposition to be agitated in both <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi>
and in the greatest and most famous <hi>Monasteries</hi> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

forreign Bishop. Which being testified and returned, under
the hands and seales respectively (the Originals whereof are still
remaining in the Library of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Robert Cotton)</hi> was a good preamble
to the Bishops, and the rest of the Clergy, assembled in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
to conclude the like. And so accordingly they did, and
made an <hi>Instrument thereof</hi> subscribed by the hands of all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and others of the Clergy, and afterwards confirmed the same
by their corporal Oaths. The copies of which Oaths and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>fol.</hi> 1210, 1211. of the Edition of <hi>Iohn Day Anno</hi> 1570. And this
was semblably the ground of a following <hi>statute,</hi> 35 H. 8. c. 1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
another Oath was devised and ratified, to be imposed upon the
Subject, for the more cleer asserting of the Kings Supremacy, and
the utter exclusion of the Popes for ever; which <hi>statutes,</hi> though
they were all repealed by an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> 1 and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Phil.</hi> and
<hi>Mary,</hi> c. 1. save that the name of <hi>supream Head</hi> was changed unto that
of the <hi>supream Governour,</hi> and certain clauses altered in the Oath of
<hi>Supremacy.</hi> Where (by the way) you must take notice, that the <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
which concerns the Kings Supremacy, are not introductory of
any new Right, that was not in the Crown before; but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory
of an old, as our best Lawyers tell us, and the <hi>statute</hi> of
the 26 of H. 8. c 1. doth clearly intimate. So that in the Ejection
of the Pope of Rome, which was the first and greatest step towards
the Work of Reformation, the <hi>Parliament</hi> did nothing, for ought it
appeares, but what was done before in the Convocation, and did no
more than fortifie the Results of <hi>Hely Church,</hi> by the addition and

year 1536. the authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> being abrogated, and <hi>Cranmer</hi>
fully setled in the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Clergy did agree upon a
form of <hi>Petition</hi> to be presented to the King, <hi>That he would graciously
indulge unto his subjects of the Laity the reading of the Bible in the English
Tongue, and that a new Translation of it might be forthwith made for that
end and purpose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to which godly motion, his Majesty did not onely
give Order for a new <hi>Translation,</hi> which afterwards He authorized
to be read both in publique and private; but in the interim he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
CROMWEL, his <hi>Vicar-General,</hi> to set out an <hi>Injunction</hi>
for providing the whole <hi>Bible</hi> both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> after the
<hi>Translation</hi> then in use, (which was called commonly by the name
of <hi>Matthewes Bible,</hi> but was no other then that of <hi>Tindal</hi> somewhat
altered) to be kept in every Parish Church throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for every one that would repair unto, and caused this mark or
character of Authority to be set upon them in red Letters, <hi>Set forth
with the Kings most gracious Licence;</hi> which you may see in <hi>Fox</hi> his
<hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monum.</hi> p. 1248. and 1363.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards when the new <hi>Translation</hi> so often promised, and so
long expected, was compleat and finished; printed at <hi>London</hi> by the
Kings Authority, and countenanced by a grave and pious Preface
of Arch Bishop <hi>Cranmer;</hi> the King sets out a <hi>Proclamation dated
May 6. Anno</hi> 1541. Commanding all the <hi>Curates</hi> and <hi>Parishioners</hi>
throughout the Kingdom, who were not already furnished with
<hi>Bibles</hi> so authorized and translated, as is before said, to provide
themselves before <hi>Al. hallowtide</hi> next following, and to cause the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
so provided, to be placed conveniently in their several and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective

in a <hi>matter</hi> which concern'd <hi>Religion,</hi> (which howsoever if you

or <hi>decision</hi> of the points in question) yet I presume the Papists
wil not use this for an Argument, that we have either a <hi>Parliament
Religion,</hi> or a <hi>Parliament Gospel;</hi> or that we stand indebted to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
for the use of the Scriptures in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, which is
so principal a part of the Reformation. Nor did the <hi>Parliament</hi> speed
so prosperously in the undertaking (which the wise King permitted
them to have a hand in, for the foresaid ends,) or found so general
an obedience in it from the common people, as would have been
expected in these Times, on the like occasion; but that the King
was fain to quicken and give life to the Acts thereof, by his <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
Anno</hi> 1546. which you shal finde in <hi>Fox</hi> his book, <hi>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To drive this Nail a little further: The terrour of this <hi>statute</hi>
dying with <hi>H.</hi> 8. or being repealed by that of K. <hi>Ed. 6. c.</hi> 22. the
<hi>Bible</hi> was again made publique; and not onely suffered to be read
by particular persons, either privatly, or in the Church; but order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be read over yearly in the Congregation, as a part of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,</hi>
or <hi>Divine Service:</hi> Which how far it relates to the Court of
<hi>Parliament</hi> we shal see anon; But for the publishing thereof in Print
for the use of the people, for the comfort and edification of private
persons, that was done onely by the King, at least in his Name, and
by His Authority. And so it also stood in Q <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the
<hi>translation</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> being again reviewed by some of the most
learned Bishops, appointed thereunto by the Queens Commission
(from whence is had the name of the <hi>Bishops Bible)</hi> and upon that
review, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with reference to the Scriptures in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, otherwise
then at the reading of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that Tongue, in the Congregation,
is to be reckoned for a part of the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> whereof more

                  <p>
                     <hi>In the translation of them into</hi> Welch, <hi>or</hi> British, <hi>somwhat indeed
was done which doth look this way. It being ordered in the</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
5. Eliz. c. 28. That the B. B. of <hi>Hereford, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Davids, Bangor, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff,</hi>
and <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Asaph,</hi> should take care amongst them for translating the whole
Bible, with the book of Common Prayer, into the Welch or Brittish Tongue,
on pain of forseiting 40 l. a piece in default hereof. And to incourage them
thereunto, it was enacted that one book of either sort being so translated and
imprinted should be provided and bought for every Cathedral Church, as also
for all Parish Churches and Chappels of Ease, where the said tongue is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
used; the Ministers to pay the one half of the price, and the Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
the other.</p>
                  <p>But then you must observe withal, that it had been before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the Convocation of the self-same year, <hi>Anno 1562. That
the Common-Prayer of the Church ought to be celebrated in a tongue which
was under stood by the people</hi> (as you may see in the book of <hi>Articles of
Religion, Art.</hi> 24. which came out that year) and consequently, aswel
in the <hi>Welch</hi> or <hi>Brittish,</hi> as in any other. Which care, had it been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for <hi>Ireland</hi> also as it was for <hi>Wales,</hi> no question but that people
had been more generally civiliz'd, and made conformable in all
points to the <hi>English</hi> Government long before this time. And for
the new Translation of K. <hi>Iames</hi> his time, to shew that the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture is no work of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as it was principally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by some passages in the Conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court,
without recourse unto the <hi>Parliament,</hi> so was it done onely by such
men as the King appointed, and by His Authority alone imprinted,
published and imposed, care being taken by the Canon of the year,
1603. <hi>That one of them should be provided for each several at Church, at the
charge of the Parish.</hi> No flying in this case to an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <head>4 Of the Reformation of Religion in points of
Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>NExt let us look upon the method used in former Times in the
reforming of the Church, whether in points of Doctrine, or in
formes of Worship, and we shal find it stil the same. The <hi>Clergy</hi> did
the work as to them seemed best, never advising with the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
but upon the <hi>post-fact,</hi> and in most cases not at all. And first for <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinals,</hi>
there was but little done in K. <hi>Henries</hi> time, but that which
was acted by the <hi>Clergy</hi> onely in their <hi>Convocation,</hi> and so commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the people by the Kings sole Authority, the matter being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
brought within the cognizance of the two Houses of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
For in the year 1536. being the year in which the Popes Authority
was for ever banished, there were some <hi>Articles</hi> agreed on in the
<hi>Convocation,</hi> and represented to the King, under the hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Abbots, Priors, and inferior <hi>Clergy</hi> usually called unto those
Meetings; the Original whereof being in S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> Library
I have often seen: Which being approved of by the King, were
forthwith published under the Title of <hi>Articles devised by the Kings
Highness, to stable Christian quietness and unity amongst the people.</hi> In
which it is to be observed: First, that those <hi>Articles</hi> make mention
of Sacraments onely, that is to say, of Baptisme, <hi>Penance,</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Altar.</hi> And secondly, That in the <hi>Declaration</hi> of the
Doctrine of <hi>Iustification, Images, honouring of the Saiuts departed;</hi> as also
concerning many of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and the fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> they
differ'd very much from those Opinions which had been formerly
received in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as you may partly see by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of them, which occurs in <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monuments, Vol. 2. fol.
1246.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the confirming of which book, and recommending it to the
use of the people, His Majesty was pleased in the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of the
year, 1536. to give command to all Deans, Parsons, Vicars, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
so to open and declare in their Sermons, and other Collaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the said <hi>Articles</hi> unto them which be under their Cure, that
they might plainly know and discern, which of them be necessary
to be believed and observed for their salvation, and which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> onely
concern the decent and politique Order of the Church. And this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61736:15"/>
he did upon this ground, that the said <hi>Articles</hi> had been <hi>concluded
and condescended upon by the Prelates and Clergy of the Realm in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;</hi> as appeareth in the very words of the <hi>Injunction:</hi> For
which, see <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monuments, fol.</hi> 1247. I find not any thing
in <hi>Parliament</hi> which relates to this, either to countenance the work,
or to require obedience and conformity from the hand of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And to say truth, neither the King nor Clergy did account it
necessary, but thought their own Authority sufficient to go
through with it; though certainly it was more necessary at that
time, then in any since: The power and reputation of the <hi>Clergy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under foot, the King scarce setled in the <hi>Supremacy</hi> so lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized
unto him; and therefore the Authority of the <hi>Parliament</hi>
of more use then afterward, in Times well ballanced and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that in some other year of that Princes Reign, we finde
some use and mention of an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> in matters which
concerned Religion; but it was onely in such Times when the

For in the year 1539. being the 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. When the Lord

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> power began to decline, and the King was in a necessity of
complyance with His Neighbouring Princes, there passed an Act of
<hi>Parliament</hi> commonly called the <hi>statute</hi> of the six <hi>Articles</hi> (or the
Whip with six strings.) In which it was enacted, <hi>That whosoever by
word or writing should preach, teach, or publish, that in the blessed Sacraments
of the Altar, under form of Bread and Wine, there is not really the naturall
body and bloud of our Saviour Iesus Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary,
(or affirm otherwise thereof then was maintained and taught in the Church
of</hi> Rome) <hi>should be adjudged an Heretick, and suffer death, by burning, and
forfeit all his Lands and Goods, as in case of High Treason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That whosoever should teach or preach, that the Communion
of the blessed Sacrament (in both kindes) is necessary for the health of mans
soul, and ought to be maintained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Or that any man after the Order of Priesthood received, might
marry, or contract Matrimony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Or that any woman which had vowed and professed chastity,
might contract Marriage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Or that private Masses were not lawful and laudable, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61736:15"/>
                     <hi>Or sixthly,</hi> That curicular Confession was not necessary and expedient to
be used in the Church of God, should suffer death, and forfeit Lands and goods
as a Fellon, 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 14.</p>
                  <p>The rigour of which terrible <hi>statute</hi> was shortly after mittigated
in the said Kings Reign, 32 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 10. and 35 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 5. and the
whole <hi>statute</hi> absolutely repealed by Act of <hi>Parliament, 1 E. 6. c.</hi> 12.
But then it is to be observed first, that this <hi>Parliament of K.</hi> H. 8. did
not determine any thing in those six points of Doctrine which are
therein recited; but onely took upon them to devise a course for the
suppressing of the contrary Opinions, by adding by the secular
Power, the punishment of Death, and forfeiture of Lands &amp; Goods,
unto the censures of the Church, which were grown weak, if not
unvalid; and consequently, by degrees became neglected ever since
the said K. <hi>Henry</hi> took the Headship on Him, and exercised the same
by a Lay <hi>Vicar General.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And secondly, you must observe, that it appeareth evidently by
the Act it self, that at the same time th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> King had called a</hi> Synod and
Convocation of all the Archbishops, Bishops, and other learned men of the
Clergy, that the Articles were first deliberately and advisedly debated, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
and reasoned, by the said Archbishops, Bishops, and other learned men of
the Clergy, and their opinions in the same declared and made known, before
the matter came in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>And finally, That being brought into the <hi>Parliament,</hi> there was
not any thing declared and passed as <hi>doctrinall, but by the assent of the
Lords Spiritual, and other learned men of the Clergy,</hi> as by the Act it self
doth at large appear.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Whatsoever, may be drawn from thence, can be only this,
That K. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n.</hi> did make use of his Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
and confirming of some points of Popery, which seemed
to be in danger of a Reformation. And this compared with the <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>
of the 34 and 35, prohibiting the reading of the <hi>Bible</hi> by most
sorts of people, doth cleerly shew that the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of those times
did rather hinder and retard the work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> in some espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
parts thereof, than give any furtherance to the same.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: There was another point of <hi>Reformation</hi> begun
in the Lord <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>mwels</hi> time, but not produced, nor brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
till after his decease; and then too, not without the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery
of an Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> For in the year 1537. the Bishops
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61736:16"/>
and others of the Clergy of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> had composed a Book,
entituled, <hi>The Institution of a Christian Man;</hi> which being subscribed
by all their hands, was by them presented to the King, by His most
excellent judgment to be allowed of, or condemned. This book,
containing the chief heads of Christian Religion, was forthwith
printed, and exposed to publike view. But some things not being
cleerly explicated, or otherwise subject to exception, he caused it to
be reviewed and to that end, as <hi>Supream Head on Earth of the Church
of England</hi> (I speak the very words of the Act of Parl. 32. H. 8. c. 26.)
<hi>appointed the Archbishops and Bishops of both Provinces, and also a great
number of the best, learned, honestest, and most vertuous sort of the Doctors
of Divinity, men of discretion, judgment, and good disposition, to be called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
to the intent, that according to the very Gospel and Law of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any partial respect or affection to the Papistical sort, or any other sect or
sects whatsoever, they sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Articles and points of our Faith and Belief; with the Declaration, true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Grace; advice, councel, and consent, shall be thought needful and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
as also for the lawful Rights, Ceremonies, and observation of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
within this Realm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was in the year, 1540. at what time the Parliament was also
sitting; of which the King was pleased to make this especial use,
That whereas the work which was in hand (I use again the words
of the <hi>statute)</hi> required ripe and mature deliberation, and was not
rashly to be defined and set forth, and so not fit to be restrained to
the present Session, an Act was passed to this effect, <hi>That all Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Declarations, Decrees, Definitions, and Ordinances, as according to
Gods Word, and Christs Gospel, should at any time hereafter be set forth by
the said Archbishops and Bishops, and Doctors in Divinity, now appointed, or
hereafter to be appointed by his Royal Majesty, or else by the whole Clergy of
England, in, and upon the matter of Christs Religion, and the Christian
Faith, and the lawful Rights Ceremonies, and Observations of the same, by
his Majesties advice and confirmation under the great Seal of England, shall
be by all his Graces subjects fully believed, obeyed, observed, and performed to
all purposes and intents, upon the paines and penalties therein to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
as if the same had been in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> and fully
made, set forth, declared, and contained in the said Act, 32. H. 8. c.</hi> 26. where
note, That the two House of Parliament were so far from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edling
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61736:16"/>
in the matter which was then in hand, that they did not so much as
require to see the Determinations and Decrees of those learned
men whom His Majesty had then assembled, before they passed the
present Act, to bind the Subject fully to believe, observe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the same; but left it wholly to the judgment and discretion
of the King and Clergy, and trusted them besides, with the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and inflicting of such paines and penalties on disobedient and
unconformable persons as to them seemed meet.</p>
                  <p>This ground-work laid, the work went forwards in good order,
and at last being brought unto as much perfection as the said Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, and other learned men would give it, without the
co-operation and concurrence of the Royal assent; it was presented
once again to the Kings consideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who very carefully perused
it, and altered many things with his own hand; as appeares by the
book it self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ll extant in the famous Library of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Robert Cotton;</hi>
and having so altered and corrected it in some passages, returned it
to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who bestowed some further paines
upon it; to the end, that being to come forth in the Kings Name,
and by his Authority, there might be nothing in the same which
might be justly reprehended.</p>
                  <p>The business being in this forwardnesse, the King declares in
Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1544. being the 34 year of his Reign, his zeal and
care, not onely to suppress all such Bookes and Writings as were
noysome and pestilent, and tended to the seducing of his subjects;
but also to ordain and establish a certain form of pure and sincere
Teaching agreeable to Gods Word, and the true Doctrine of the
Catholick and Apostolick Church, whereunto men may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
for the decision of some such controversies, as have in Times
past, and yet do happen to arise.</p>
                  <p>And for a preparatory thereunto, that so it might come forth
with the greater credit, he caused an Act to pass in Parliament for
the abolishing of all Bookes and Writings, comprizing any matters
of Christian Religion, contrary to that Doctrine, which since the
year 1540. is, or any time during the Kings life, shall be, set forth by
his Highnesse, and for the punishment of all such (and that too,
with most grievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>) which should preach, teach, maintain,
or defend any matter or thing contrary to the book of Doctrine,
which was then in readiness, 34, 35 H. 8. c. 1. Which done, He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the said book to be imprinted in the year next following, under
the Title of <hi>Anecessdry Doctrine for all sorts of people;</hi> prefixing a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
thereto in his Royal Name, to all his faithful and loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that they might know the better in those dangerous Times,
what to believe in point of Doctrine, and how they were to carry
and behave themselves in points of practice.</p>
                  <p>Which Statute, as it is the greatest Evidence which those Times
afford to shew, that both, or either of the Houses of Parliament had
any thing to do in matters which concerned Religion; so it entitles
them to no more (if at all to any thing) then that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y did make
way to a book of Doctrine, which was before digested by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
onely, revised after, and corrected by the Kings own hand; and
finally, perused and perfected by the <hi>Metr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And more then so (besides, that being but one Swallow, it can
make no Summer) it is acknowledged and confessed in the Act it
self (if Poulton understand it rightly in his Abridgment) That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
must be had to the Catholick and Apostolick Church, for
the decision of Controversies. Which as it gives the Clergy the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
power, so it left nothing to the Houses but to assist and aid them
with the Temporal Sword, when the Spiritual Word could not do
the deed, the point thereof being blunted, and the edge abated.</p>
                  <p>Next, let us look upon the time of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and we shall finde the
Articles and Doctrine of the Church (excepting such as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the book of Common-Prayer) to be composed, confirmed,
and setled in no other way, then by the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them.</p>
                  <p>For, in the Synod held in <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1552. the Clergy did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and agree upon a book of Articles, containing the chief heads
of the Christian Faith; especially, with reference to such points of
Controversie, as were in difference between the Reformators of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Opponents
whatsoever which after were approved, and published by the Kings
Authority.</p>
                  <p>They were in number 41. and were published by this following

was held at the very time, and that the <hi>Parliament</hi> passed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acts which concerned Church-matters; as, viz. An Act for <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Divine Service, and for the confirmation of the book of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
5 and 6 <hi>Edw. 6. c. 1. All Act declaring which dayes onely shall be kept
for Holy dayes; and which for Fasting dayes, C. 3. against striking or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weapon, either in the Church or Church-yard, C.</hi> 4. And finally,
another Act <hi>for the legitimating of the Marriages of Priests and Ministers,</hi>
C. 12. Yet neither in this <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor in that which followed, is
there so much as the least syllable which reflecteth this way, or
medleth any thing at all with the book of <hi>Articles.</hi> Where, by the
way, if you behold the lawfulnesse of <hi>Priests Marriages</hi> as a matter
<hi>Doctrinal;</hi> or think we owe that point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> &amp; the indulgence
granted to the Clergy in it, to the care and goodness of the Parl. you
may please to know, that the point had been before determined in
the Convocation, &amp; stands determined by and for the Clergy in the 31
of those <hi>Articles,</hi> and that the <hi>Parliament</hi> looked on it as a point of
<hi>Doctrine;</hi> but as it was a matter <hi>practical,</hi> conducing to the benefit
and improvement of the Common-wealth. Or if it did, yet was
the <hi>statute</hi> built on no other ground-work, than the Resolution of
the <hi>Clergy, the Marriage of Priests being before determined to be most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
(I use the very words of the Act it self) <hi>and according to the
Word of God, by the learned Clergy of this Realm in their Convocations, as
well by the common assent, as by subscriptions of their hands,</hi> 5, 6. Edw. 6.
chap. 12.</p>
                  <p>And for the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it is most manifest, that they
had no other body of Doctrine in the first part of her Reign, then
onely the said <hi>Articles of K. Edwards</hi> book; and that which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the book of <hi>Homilies</hi> of the said Kings time: in which the
<hi>Parliament</hi> had as little to do, as you have seen they had in the book
of <hi>Articles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the year, 1562. being the fifth of the Qu.
Reign, the Bishops and Clergy taking into consideration the said
book of <hi>Articles,</hi> and altering what they thought most fitting, to
make it more conducible to the use of the Church, and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people, presented it unto the Queen, who caused it to be
published with this Name and Title, <hi>viz. Articles whereupon it was
agreed by the Arch-Bishops, and Bishops of both Provinces, and the whole
Clergy in the Convocation holden at London, Anno 1562, for the avoiding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61736:18"/>
of diversity of Opinions, and for the establishing of Consent touching true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
put forth by the Queens authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of any thing done, or pretended to be done, by the power of the

                  <p>At last, indeed in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the said Queens Reign (which was

for <hi>the redressing of disorders in the Ministers of holy Church:</hi> In which
it was enacted, <hi>That all such as were ordained Priests or Ministers of Gods

shews (if you observe it well) that though the <hi>Parliament</hi> did well
allow of, and approve the said book of <hi>Articles,</hi> yet the said book
owes neither confirmation, nor authority, to the Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
So that the wonder is the greater, that that most insolent scoff
which is put upon us by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in calling our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

of Worship as have been setled in this Church, since the first
dawning of the day of <hi>Reformation,</hi> in which our <hi>Parliaments</hi> have
indeed done somewhat, though it be not much. The first point
which was altered in the publike Liturgies, was that the <hi>Creed,</hi> the
<hi>Pater-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ster,</hi> and the Ten <hi>Commandements,</hi> were ordered to be said in
the <hi>English</hi> Tongue; to the intent, the people might be perfect in
them, and learn them without book, as our phrase is. The next, the
setting forth and using of the <hi>English Letany,</hi> on such dayes and
times, in which it was accustomably to be read, as a part of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
But neither of these two was done by <hi>Parliament;</hi> nay, (to say
truth) the <hi>Parliament</hi> did nothing in them. All which was done in
either of them, was onely by the Kings Authority, by vertue of the
<hi>Headship</hi> or <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which by way of recognition was vested
in him by the Clergy, either co-operating and concurring with
them in their <hi>Convocations,</hi> or else directed and assisted by such learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Prelates,</hi> with whom he did advise in matters which concerned
the Church, and did relate to <hi>Reformation.</hi> By vertue of which <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
or <hi>Supremacy</hi> he ordained the first; and to that end, caused cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Injunctions</hi> to be published by the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
then his <hi>Vicar General, Anno</hi> 1536. And by the same did he give order
for the second, I mean, for the saying of the <hi>Letany</hi> in the <hi>English</hi>
Tongue, by his own Royal Proclamation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1545. For which,
consult the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments, fol.</hi> 1248, 1312. But these were only
preparations to a greater work which was reserved unto the times
of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. In the beginning of whose Reign there passed a <hi>statute</hi>

thus assembled? that the Statute tels us: Where it is said, that
<hi>by the aid of the Holy Ghost</hi> (I pray you mark this well) <hi>and with one

Ceremonies of the Church, after the use of the Church of</hi> England. All
this was done before the <hi>Parliament</hi> did any thing. But what was
done by them at last? Why first, considering the most godly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
of the Kings Highness, and the Lord Protector and others of
his Highness Councel, in gathering together the said B. and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men. Secondly, the Godly prayers, Orders, Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61736:20"/>
in the said Book mentioned. Thirdly, the motives and
inducements which inclined the aforesaid learned men to alter
those things which were altered, and to retain those things
which were retained; And finally, taking into consideration
the honour of God, and the great quietness which by the grace
of God would ensue upon it; they gave his Majesty most hearty
and lowely thanks for the same, and most humbly prayed him,
that it <hi>might be ordained by his</hi> Majesty, <hi>with the assent of the Lords
and Commons assembled in Parliament, and by authority of the same, that
the said</hi> Form of Common-prayer <hi>and another, after the Feast of</hi>
Pentecost <hi>next following, should be used in all his Majesties Dominions
with several penalties to such, as either should deprave or neglect the same.</hi>
2. and 3. E. 6. cap. 1. So farre the very words of the Act it self.
By which it evidently appeareth, that the two Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi>
did nothing in the present business, but impose that Form upon the
people: which by the learned &amp; religious <hi>Clergy-men</hi> (whom the K.
appointed thereunto) was agreed upon, and made it <hi>penal</hi> unto
such as either should deprave the same, or neglect to use it. And
thus doth <hi>Poulton</hi> (no mean Lawyer) understand the Statute,
who therfore gives no other title to it in his <hi>Abridgement</hi> published
in the year 1612 than this, <hi>The penalty for not using uniformity of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and Ministration of the Sacrament.</hi> So then the making of <hi>one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

the making of the <hi>Penalties,</hi> was the work of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Where

who made it; or else, by those (if they were not the same men)
who were appointed by the King to draw up, and compose a <hi>Form
of Ordination</hi> for the use of the Church. And this <hi>Assent</hi> of theirs
(for it was no more) was the onely part that was ever acted by the

Afterwards in the year 1541, the King perceiving with what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
the people were induced to leave off those <hi>Holy days,</hi> to
which they had been so long ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the twenty third of <hi>Iuly,</hi> for the abolishing of such <hi>Holy days</hi>
(amongst other things) as were prohibited before by his Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:

                  <p>And so it stood until the Reign of King <hi>E.</hi> 6. at which time the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>

in the present businesse, no days being to be kept or accounted <hi>holy,</hi>
but those for which the Church had set apart a peculiar office, and not all
those neither: For, whereas there are several and peculiar offices for the
day of the <hi>Conversion</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the day of Saint <hi>Barnabas</hi> the
Apostles; neither of these are kept as <hi>holy days,</hi> nor reckoned or esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in such business as concerned the <hi>Clergy,</hi> for fear of being
questioned for it at the <hi>Churches</hi> Bar. But when that Power

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to your weaknesse, (as you pleased to call it) and
freeing you from those doubts which lay heaviest on you.
And therewithall you did request me to give you leave to

to the King, the Pope and the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too little or too much looked after in the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
And first you say it is complained of by some Zelots of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope was very hardly and unjustly
dealt with in being deprived of the <hi>Supremacy</hi> so long enjoyed
and exercised by his predecessors, and that it was an <hi>innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
no lesse strange then dangerous to settle it upon the
King. 2. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> ought not to have
proceeded to a <hi>Reformation</hi> without the <hi>Pope,</hi> considered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the Western world, or the Apostle in

had been found so necessary, it ought to have been done
by a <hi>General Councel,</hi> at least with the consent and co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sister-Churches, especially of those who were
engaged at the same time in the same designs. 4. That in
the carrying on of the <hi>Reformation</hi> the Church proceeded ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unadvisedly, in letting the people have the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
and the publique <hi>Liturgie</hi> in the <hi>

consequents whereof are now grown too visible.
5. That the proceedings in the point of the <hi>Common-prayer

usage also of their own <hi>Predecessors</hi> in this Kingdome, till
Papal Usurpation carried all before it. And being that all
the Popes pretended to in this Realm was but Usurpation,
it was no <hi>wrong</hi> to take that from him which he had no <hi>right</hi>

Milevis,</hi> we have seen before, and might adde many others
now, did we think it necessary. The Church had been in

power of <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors, when such a confluence of the
Prelates from all parts of the world would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
a <hi>Conspiracie</hi> against the State, and drawn destruction

they might assemble without any such danger, yet being

                     </gap>wly, and not without long time
and many difficulties and disputes, to be rightly consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted:
the Church would suffer more under such delay by
the spreading of <hi>Heresie,</hi> then receive benefit by their care to
suppress the same. Had the same course been taken at <hi>Alexandria</hi>
for suppressing <hi>Arius,</hi> as was before at <hi>Antioch</hi> for condemning
<hi>Paulus;</hi> we never had heard newes of the Councel of <hi>Nice;</hi>
the calling and assembling whereof took up so long time,
that <hi>Arianism</hi> was diffused over all the world before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
met together; and could not be suppress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d (though it
were condemned) in many ages following after. The
plague of Heresie, and leprosie of sin would quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
the whole face of the Church, if capable of no other
cure then a <hi>General Councel.</hi> The case of <hi>Arius,</hi> and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal

                  <p>To go a little further yet, we will suppose a <hi>General
Councel</hi> to be the best and safest Physick that the Church can

it may conveniently be had. For where it is not to be
had or not had conveniently, it will either prove to be no
<hi>Physick,</hi> or not worth the taking. But so it was, that at the
time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> a <hi>General Councel</hi> could not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
be assembled, and more then so it was impossible that
any such <hi>Councel</hi> should assemble; I mean a <hi>General Councel</hi>
rightly called and constituted, according to the Rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> laid
down by our <hi>Controversors.</hi> For first they say it must be called
by such as have power to do it. 2. That it must be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
to all Christian Churches, that so no Church nor
people may plead ignorance of it. 3. The Pope and the
four chief Patriarchs must be present at it, either in person or

he be known to be a Bishop and not excommunicated. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which Rules, it was impossible I say, that any

in a <hi>General Councel,</hi> there have been ten at least suppressed
in <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Provincial</hi> Synods; wich could not be in case
they had no power of <hi>Determination.</hi> And thirdly, That the

were this place fit for it. But what needs any proof at all,
when we have Confession? For the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato</hi>
(a man as well studied in the Fathers, as the best amongst
them) ingenuously acknowledged at the <hi>High Commission,</hi> that
the <hi>Articles of this Church were profitable, none of them</hi> Heretical;

a <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> sense: which is as much as could be
looked for from the mouth of an Adversary. So much as
cost one of them his life (though perhaps it will be said that
he died in prison) and the burning of his body after his

and manner of proceeding in it: which though you finde
by perusal of the papers which I sent first unto you, not to
have been so <hi>Parliamentarian</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> made it; yet still
you doubt whether it were so <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Canonical</hi> as it
might have been. And this you stumble at the rather, in
regard that the whole Body of the Clergy in their <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
had no hand therein, either as to <hi>decree</hi> the doing of it,
or to <hi>approve</hi> it being done; but that it was resolved on by
the King (or rather by the Lord Protector in the Kings <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority)</hi>
with some few of the Bishops; by which Bishops and
as small a number of learned Church-men, being framed and
fashioned, it was allowed of by the King, confirmed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
rather by an Act of Parliament. Your question
hereupon is this, <hi>Whether the King</hi> (for his acting it by a

part of his</hi> Bishops and Clergy, <hi>and having their consent therein,
may conclude any thing in the way of a</hi> Reformation, the <hi>residue

and therefore it concerns me to be very punctual in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

                  <p>And that my Answer may be built on the surer Ground,
it is to be consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>practical,</hi> whether such practise have the character of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
Vni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ersality,</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> imprinted on it; or that it be
the practise of particular Churchs, and of some times only.
And 3. if in points of Doctrine, whether such points have
been determined of before in a <hi>General Councel,</hi> or in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Councels universally received and countenanced; or
are to be defined <hi>de novo</hi> on emergent controversies. And
these <hi>Disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ctions</hi> being laid, I shall answer briefly. First, if
the things to be reformed be either corruptions in manners, or
neglect of publick duties to Almighty God, abuses either
in Government or the parties governing: the King may do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61736:45"/>
it of himself by his sole authority. The <hi>Clergy</hi> are beholding
to him, if he takes any of them along with him when he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
about it. And if the times should be so bad, that either
the whole body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> or any (though the greatest)
part thereof should oppose him in it; he may go forwards
notwithstanding, punishing such as shall gainsay him in so
good a work, and compelling others. And thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I look on
as a Power annexed to the Regal Diadem, and so insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
annexed, that Kings could be no longer Kings if it were
denied them. But hereof we have spoke already in the
first of this <hi>Section,</hi> and shall speak more hereof in the next
that followes. And on the other side, if the <hi>Reformation</hi> be
in points of Doctrine, and in such points of doctrine as have
not been before defined, or not defined in form, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as before laid down: the King only with a few of his
Bishops and learned Clergy (though never so well studied
in the point disputed) can do nothing in it. That belongs
only to the whole Body of the Clergy in their <hi>Convocation</hi>
rightly called and constituted; whose Acts being ratified
by the King, binde not alone the rest of the Clergy in
whose names they <hi>Voted,</hi> but all the residue of the subjects
of what sort soever, who are to acquiesce in their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The constant practise of the Church, and that
which we have said before touching the calling and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> makes this clear enough. But if the
thing to be <hi>Reformed</hi> be a matter <hi>practical,</hi> we are to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the usage of the <hi>primitive</hi> times. And if the <hi>practise</hi> prove
to have been both ancient and universally received over all
the Church, though intermitted for a time and by time cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
the King consulting with so many of his Bishops
and others of his most able Clergy, as he thinks fit to call
unto him, and having their consent and direction in it;
may in the case of <hi>intermission</hi> revive such practise, and in
the case of <hi>corruption</hi> and degeneration restore it to its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and original lustre, whether he do it of himself, of
his own <hi>meer motion,</hi> or that he follow the advice of his
<hi>Councel</hi> in it; whether he be of age to inform himself, or
that he doth relie on those to whom he hath committed the
publick Government; it comes all to one: so they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61736:46"/>
themselves to the ancient patterns. The Reformation
which was made under <hi>Iosias,</hi> though in his Minority and

in succeeding ages? Sufficient ground for <hi>Christian</hi> Princes
to proceed on in the like occasions: especially when all
they do is rather the reviving of the Ancient Formes then the
<hi>Introduction</hi> of a new. Which as the King did here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by his own Authority, the Body of the Clergy not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted

in it; so possibly there might be good reason, why
those who had the conduct of the Kings affairs, thought it
not safe to put the managing of the businesse to a <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The ignorance and superstition of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was at that time exceeding profitable to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who

great advantage, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the <hi>Silver-Smith</hi> by <hi>Dianas</hi>

Clergy had not much more learning then what was
taught them in the <hi>Missals</hi> and other <hi>Rituals,</hi> and well might
fear that if the <hi>Service</hi> were once extant in the <hi>English</hi> tongue,
the <hi>Laity</hi> would prove in time as great <hi>Clerks</hi> as themselves. So

it was most probable that such an hard piece of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
would not easily down, had it been put into the
power of a <hi>Convocation:</hi> especially under a Prince in <hi>Nonage,</hi>
and a state unsetled. And yet it was not so carryed without
them neither, but that the <hi>Bishops</hi> generally did concur to the
Confirmation of the Book (or the approbation of it rather)
when it passed in Parliament: the Bishops in that time and
after, (till the late vast and most improvident increase of
the Lay-nobility) making the most considerable, if not the
greatest part of the House of <hi>Peers;</hi> and so the Book not
likely to be there allowed of, without their consent. And
I the rather am inclined unto that Opinion, because I finde
that none but <hi>Tunstall, Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> were displaced
from their Bishopricks, for not submitting in this case to
the Kings appointments; which seems to me a very strong and
convincing argument, that none but they dissented or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
conformity. Adde here, that though the whole body
of the Clergy in their <hi>Convocation</hi> were not consulted with
at first (for the Reasons formerly recited) yet when they
found the benefit and comfort which redounded by it to
good Christian people, and had by little and little wean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the <hi>Post-fact:</hi> passing an <hi>Article</hi> in the Convocation of the

it when it came before them, and that the whole body of
the Clergy in their <hi>Convocation</hi> (the Book being then under
a <hi>review)</hi> did avow and justifie it: The result of all I say is
this, that as the work it self I say was good, so it was done

<hi>regulating</hi> the external parts of Gods publick worship accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>But yet the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had a further right as to this

                     </gap>allage on these of
the times succeeding, inconsistent with their native Rights, and
contrary to the usage of the Primitive Church: I hope it will
be no hard matter to remove that <hi>scruple.</hi> It's true the Clergy
in their Convocation can do nothing now, but as their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are confirmed by the Kings authority, and I conceive
it stands with reason (as well as point of State) that it
should be so. For since the two Houses of Parliament, though
called by the Kings Writ, can conclude nothing which may
binde either King or Subject, in their Civil Rights, untill it
be made good by the Royal Assent; so neither is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it nor
safe, that the Clergy should be able by their Constitutions
and <hi>Synodical</hi> Acts, to conclude both Prince and People in
spiritual matters, untill the stamp of Royal Authority be
imprinted on them. The Kings concurrence in this case
devesteth not the Clergy of any lawful power which they
ought to have, but restrains them only in the exercise of some
part thereof, to make it more agreeable to Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
&amp; to accommodate it to the benefit both of Prince
and People. It's true the Clergy of this Realm can neither
meet in Convocation, nor conclude any thing therein, nor
put in execution any thing which they have concluded, but
as they are enabled by the Kings authority. But then it is as
true withall, that this is neither inconsistent with their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Rights, nor contrary unto the usage of the Primitive
Times. And first it is not inconsistent with their native
Rights, it being a peculiar happinesse of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to be alwaies under the protection of <hi>Christian</hi> Kings;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61736:48"/>
by whose encouragement and example, the Gospel was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in all parts of this Kingdome. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I believe that you will hardly finde any Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

enjoyed this Prerogative without any dispute after the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

himself (as before was shewn) and then conferred it upon
such as were to exercise the same under his authority:

one to whom they had made themselves a kinde of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

                        <desc>•</desc>

the Clergy did assemble in their National and Provincial
Synods of their own Authority: which Councels being
summoned by the Metropolitans, and subscribed by the
Clergy, were of sufficient power to binde all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
who lived within the Verge of their Jurisdiction.
They could not else assemble upon any exigence of affai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church came under the protection of Christian Princes: all

it being evident in the Records of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, that
the opening and confirming of all their Councels not only
under the <hi>Caroline</hi> but under the <hi>Merovignean</hi> Family, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
by the power, &amp; sometimes with the Presidence of their
Kings and Princes, as you may finde in the Collections of
<hi>Lindebrogius,</hi> and <hi>Sirmondus</hi> the <hi>Iesuite:</hi> and finally that in <hi>Spain</hi>
it self (though now so much obnoxious to the Papal power)
the two at <hi>Bracara,</hi> and the ten first holden at <hi>Toledo,</hi> were
summoned by the Writ and Mandate of the Kings thereof.
Or if you be not willing to take this pains, I shall put
you to a shorter and an easier search; referring you for your
better information in this particular to the learned Sermon
preached by Bishop <hi>Andrewes</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court, anno</hi> 1606.
touching the <hi>Right and power of calling Assemblies,</hi> or the right
use of the Trumpets. A Sermon preached purposely at that
time and place for giving satisfaction in that point to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
and some leading men of the <hi>Scotish Puritans,</hi> who of late
times had arrogated to themselves an unlimited power of
calling and constituting their Assemblies without the Kings
cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt and against his will.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Vassallage</hi> which the Clergy are supposed to have
drawn upon themselves by this Submission, I see no fear or
danger of it as long as the two Houses of Parliament are in
like condition; and that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are so tender
of their own <hi>Prerogative,</hi> as not to suffer any one Body of the
Subjects to give a Law unto the other without his consent.
That which is most insisted on for the proof hereof, is the
delegating of this power by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. to Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Cromwell</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and Lord high Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain)
by the name of his <hi>Vicar General in Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61736:49"/>

1536. and acted other things of like nature in the years next
following. And this (especially his presiding in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation)
is looked on both by <hi>Sanders</hi> and some <hi>Protestant</hi>
Doctors, not only as a great debasing of the <hi>English</hi> Clergie
(men very learned for those times) but as <hi>deforme satis Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
