         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobias the ſervant an Ammonite, and Geſem
the Arabian heard it, and they mocked us, and ſaid: what is this thing
that ye doe? do ye fall away from the King?</p>
                  <p>And I anſwered them, and ſaid unto them: the God of heaven is he that
hath granted us proſperity, and we his ſervants will riſe up and build:
and as for you, there is no portion and right, nor remembrance in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe men, as they were ſad at <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> firſt coming, when they
ſee that any man found ſuch favour with the King to do good to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
ſo now were they almoſt mad for anger, when they heard
that they went about to build the wals of Jeruſalem. Openly to
withſtand them, or forbid them to work, they durſt not, becauſe
they had the Kings Commiſſion to do ſo: but ſo much as they durſt,
they diſcourage them, they mock them, they threaten to accuſe
them, and, of that which would make any man afraid, they lay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to their charge, and ſay, <hi>They would build that City for no other cauſe, but that
they would make themſelves ſtrong againſt the King,</hi> fall away from him, ſet up a King
amongſt themſelves, obey none, but uſe their old liberty, and rule all about them, as they
did afore. Theſe men bear ſome authority in the countrey, and like proud beggars, and
diſſembling malicious enemies to God and his Word, they would hinder ſo much as they
could this building. The world is too full at this day of ſuch like diſſembling hypocrites.
The one ſort if they come up of nought, and get a badge pricked on their ſleeve, though
they have little, yet they look ſo big, and ſpeak ſo ſtoutly, that they keep the poor under
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:124937:2"/>
their feet, that they dare not route. All muſt be as they ſay, though it be neither true nor
honeſt, none dare ſay the contrary. But the dungeon diſſembling Papiſt is more like unto
them, for he careth not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y what means to get it, by feare, or by flatterie, ſo that he can
obteine his purpoſe. Theſe men firſt <hi>mocke the Iewes, and ſcornefully despiſe them for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing
this building,</hi> thinking by this means to diſcourage poor ſoules that they ſhould
not go forward in this worke: After that <hi>they charge them with Rebellion.</hi> Theſe two
be the old practiſes of Sathan in his members to hinder the building of Gods houſe in all
ages. <hi>Iudas</hi> in his Epiſtle ſaith, that <hi>in the laſt dayes there ſhall come mockers, which ſhall
walk after their own wicked luſts. Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> foretold the ſame, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 2 Tim.</hi> 3.
Our Saviour Chriſt, though he was moſt ſpitefully miſuſed many ways, yet never worſe,
then when they mocked him, both <hi>Herod, Pilate, the Prieſts and the Iewes.</hi> It is
thought but a ſmall matter to mocke ſimple ſoules and ſo withdraw them from God:
but <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov. 3. He that mocketh ſhalbe mocked:</hi> and <hi>David, Pſal. 2. He that
dwelleth in the heavens ſhall mock them, and the Lord will laugh them to ſcorne.</hi> This
ſhalbe the juſt reward of ſuch ſcorners. It is juſtly to be feared, that as <hi>the Iewes were
given up to Nebuchadnezzar, for mocking the Prophets and Preachers of their time,</hi> as it is
written 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36. ſo we, for our bitter taunting, ſcoffing, reviling, diſdaining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
Gods true Miniſters in theſe dayes, ſhalbe given into our mortall enemies hands.
What is more common in theſe days then when ſuch hick-ſcorners wilbe merry at their
drunken bankets, to fall into talk of ſome one Miniſter or other: nay they ſpare none,
but go from one to another, and can ſpie a mote in other men, but cannot ſpie their own
abominations. Chriſt was never more ſpitefully and diſdainly ſcoft at, then when theſe
luſty ruffians open their mouths againſt his Preachers: but the ſame Lord Chriſt ſaith
of his diſciples, that <hi>he which deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth him.</hi> What reward the mockers
of Chriſt ſhall have, every man knoweth. Good men with heavy hearts commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their cauſe unto the Lord, and pray with <hi>David, Lord deliver my ſoule from
wicked lips, and from a deceitfull tongue. Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>God will laugh when ſuch ſhall
periſh. Michol wife to David was barren all her life for mocking her huſband when he
played on his harpe, and danced before the ark of God, 2 Sam.</hi> 6. The children that moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>Elizeus,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Come up thou bald pate, come up, were all devoured ſuddenly of
wild beares, that came out of the wood hard by, 2 King. 2. David,</hi> amongſt other miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that he complaineth of, ſaith, <hi>That the ſcorners made their ſongs of him when they
were at their drunken feaſts, Pſal.</hi> 69. and when he ſeeth no remedy how to eſcape their
poyſonfull tongues, he patiently turneth him unto the Lord, committeth all to him; and
in the latter end of the Pſalme: <hi>God</hi> comforteth him, and telleth him, <hi>what ſundry miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
ſhall fall on them,</hi> for their deſpitefull dealing. When <hi>Baltſhazzar King of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
made his drunken feaſt to his great men, and called for the veſſels and jewels which Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar
brought from Ieruſalem, that he and his harlots might eat and drink in them
in deſpite of the living God of Iſrael, Dan. 5. A hand appeared writing on the wall,</hi> which
<hi>Daniel</hi> expounded, when none of his Southſayers could do it, and ſaid, <hi>His Kingdome
ſhould be taken from him,</hi> and ſo it came to paſſe: for the ſame night <hi>Balteſhazzar</hi> was
ſlain, and <hi>Darius</hi> King of the <hi>Medes</hi> poſſeſſed his Kingdome: A juſt reward for all ſuch
drunken mockers of God, his people, Religion, and Miniſters, and yet our merry toſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots
will take no heed. <hi>Sarah ſaw Iſmael playing with Iſaac her ſonne, and ſaid to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Caſt out the handmaid and her ſonne, for he ſhall not be heire with my ſonne:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124937:2"/>
Gen.</hi> 21. but S. <hi>Paul</hi> alledging the ſame text calleth this playing perſecution, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. and
ſaith: <hi>As he that was borne after the fleſh did perſecute him that was borne after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
ſo it is now, but the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Caſt out the handmaid and her ſon, for he ſhall
not be heire with the ſon of the free-woman:</hi> ſo ſhall all ſcornfull mockers, jeſters and
railers on God, his Word, Religion, and People be caſt into utter darkneſſe, and not be
heires of Gods Kingdome with his children. This <hi>playing and mocking</hi> is bitter perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore not to be uſed of good men, nor againſt good men and lovers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yet at this day he is counted a merry companion, and welcome to great mens ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that can raile bitterly, or jeſt merrily on the Miniſters: ſuch is our love towards
God, his Word, and Miniſters: but ſurely he that loveth God and the Word indeed,
cannot abide to hear the Preachers ill ſpoken of undeſervedly: I cannot tell whether is
worſe, the ſcoffer, or the glad hearer: if the one had no pleaſure in hearing ſuch lewd
talk, the other would not tell it. The other thing they charge the Jewes withall <hi>is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
falling from the King, and ſetting up a Kingdome amongſt themſelves. When
<hi>Elias</hi> exhorted <hi>Achab</hi> and the people to return unto the Lord, <hi>Achab</hi> ſaith unto him,
<hi>Art thou he that troubleth Iſrael? nay,</hi> ſaid the Prophet, <hi>It is thou and thy fathers
houſe:</hi> rebuking him, and teaching truth, was counted troubling of the commonwealth
and the King. What was the cauſe that King <hi>Saul</hi> and his flatterers hated poor <hi>David</hi>
ſo much, and ſo cruelly ſought his death, but that the people ſung after that <hi>Goliah</hi> was
ſlain, that <hi>Saul had killed a thouſand, and David his ten thouſand:</hi> which was as much
to ſay as they thought that <hi>David</hi> was a mightier man than <hi>Saul,</hi> and meeter to be King.
<hi>Daniel ſet open his windowes, and</hi> contrary to the Kings commandement, <hi>prayed thrice a
day unto the living Lord, Dan.</hi> 6. and therefore was accuſed of diſobedience to the King,
and caſt to the lions den to be devoured of them. The Iſraelites in Egypt <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. when
God bleſſed them, and increaſed them to a great people, were accuſed that they waxed ſo
many and wealthy, that they would rebell againſt the King: and therefore to keep them
under, were oppreſſed by the task-maſters, and ſet to make brick for their buildings.
When our Lord and Maſter <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> was born, <hi>the wiſemen asked where the King of
the Iewes was: Herod</hi> was mad, and <hi>killed all the children of two yeares old and under,
Mat.</hi> 2. leſt any of them ſhould come to be King, and put him down. When our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt ſaid, <hi>His Kingdome was not of this world,</hi> then ſaid <hi>Pilate, Thou art a King
then:</hi> whereupon the Jewes took occaſion to accuſe him of treaſon, and ſaid, <hi>Every
one that maketh himſelfe a King ſpeaketh againſt the Emperour, for we have no King but
the Emperour.</hi> The Apoſtles were accuſed <hi>that they had troubled the commonwealth by
preaching Chriſt, and filled Ieruſalem with their doctrine,</hi> contrary to the commandement
of the Prieſts and Elders. <hi>Iaſon</hi> was drawn out of his houſe for lodging <hi>Paul,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
<hi>that he had troubled the world,</hi> and diſobeyed the Emperour. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> had
preached Chriſt in <hi>Athens, He was accuſed for troubling the ſtate by teaching his new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi>
thus ever the building of Gods houſe by preaching of the Goſpell hath been
charged with rebellion, diſobedience to Princes, and troubling of the common-wealth
and peace. But good men have not been diſmaid at ſuch big words, but with good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
have proceeded in their work, having the teſtimony of a good conſcience, that they
be not guilty of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>20 <hi>And I anſwered.</hi> This was the firſt puſh, but not the worſt that they had to
diſcourage them from proceeding in this building, and not unlike but it made ſome afraid,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124937:3"/>
to hear ſuch big words, and ſo great matters laid to their charge, by men of ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as they were. But as they were not aſhamed ſo unjuſtly to accuſe Gods people, ſo
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſteppeth forth, as boldly anſwereth for them all, and defendeth their doings:
A worthy example for all thoſe that be in authority to follow: they have not the ſword
committed to them in vain, they ought to defend both by word and deed, in their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings,
thoſe that be committed unto them. Their duty is not to ſuffer Gods enemies to
invade or hurt, ſlander or blaſpheme thoſe, that they have charge over, but draw the
ſword, if need be, to drive away ſuch wolves and puniſh ſuch wicked tongues. It is
not as we commonly ſay, when any danger or perſecution ariſeth for the doctrine, or that
the Miniſters are untruly reported of, let the Preachers defend it, it is their duty and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
we are not learned, it belongeth not to us, our care is for the common-wealth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Religious Magiſtrates will neither do ſo, nor ſay ſo: they will not ſuffer, as much
as in them lieth, the Church, Religion, doctrine, nor the Miniſters to be evill ſpoken of,
reviled, defaced, nor over-run. They be <hi>mouthes,</hi> to ſpeak for Gods people, as <hi>Moyſes</hi>
was unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> they be hands to fight for them, they be <hi>Rulers</hi> to defend the
good, and puniſh the evill. <hi>Iephthe</hi> when the <hi>Ammunites</hi> fought againſt <hi>Iſrael, Iudg.</hi> 11.
defended the cauſe in diſputation by words, and after in battell with the ſword. The
good King <hi>Ezechias, 2 King.</hi> 18. when he received the blaſphemous meſſage and letters
from <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> againſt God, his Temple, people and Religion, he ſeeketh by all means to
defend them all, and encourage the people not to fall away from their God in that great
danger. When <hi>Holophernes</hi> railed on God and his people, <hi>Achior</hi> and <hi>Iudeth</hi> defend
them, and ſhe cutteth off his head. When the great Giant <hi>Golias</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.) <hi>revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the people of God, and provoked them to ſight with him hand to hand, if they durſt,</hi> for
the victory, none was found that durſt doe it but poore <hi>David,</hi> who with no weapons
but his ſling and a few ſtones, killed that luſty champion, and delivered his people.
When <hi>Dathan, Chorah</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> with their fellowes, railed againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
Gods true Miniſters, <hi>Numb. 16. Moſes</hi> committing the revenge of it to the Lord,
<hi>warned the people to depart from their company, leſt they periſhed with them by that
ſtrange death:</hi> and ſtraight wayes <hi>the earth opened, and ſwallowed up them, and their
goods, and tents, where they dwelt, quicke into hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nay women were not ſpared:
for <hi>Miriam, Moſes ſiſter, was ſmitten with a leproſie for railing on Moſes her brother,</hi>
Gods lievtenant over them. As the Magiſtrate therefore both with word and ſword
muſt defend Gods cauſe, his Religion, Temple, People, Miniſters and Doctrine,
ſo muſt the Preacher, and thoſe that be learned, with their paines, prayer, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and all other meanes that they can: yea if our goods or lives were required for
the defence of it, no ſtate of men ought to refuſe it. For this end are we born and live,
to glorifie our God, and ſet forth his praiſe: for this purpoſe are all things given us, and
therefore muſt not be ſpared, but ſpent and beſtowed, when his glory requireth. I or this
cauſe <hi>Eſaias</hi> the Prophet gave his body to be ſawen in ſunder with a ſaw of iron: for
this cauſe <hi>Ieremiah was caſt into a dungeon of mire and filth, Ier. 38. Daniel into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
den;</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pleadeth his cauſe oft in chaines at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> afore
<hi>Feſtus, Felix</hi> and <hi>Agrippa:</hi> and our Lord and Maſter <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> afore <hi>Annas, Caiaphas,
Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod: Iohn Baptiſt</hi> loſt his head for this quarrell and no good men will think
any thing too dear to ſpend in <hi>Chriſts</hi> cauſe. For this cauſe <hi>Tertullian, Irenaeus, Iuſtinus,
Athanaſius, Chryſoſtom, Nazianzen,</hi> writ great books againſt the heathens, which railed on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124937:3"/>
our Religion. What infinite numbers of Martyrs have ſtood ſtoutly aud given their lives
in the ſame quarrel? he that hath ſeen any learning, can bttter tell where to begin, then
where to make an end of reckoning, the number is ſo infinite, and our late daies have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſufficient proof thereof under that bloody butcher <hi>Bonner,</hi> that the moſt ignorant, if
he will open his eares and eyes, might heare and ſee great plenty. But alas the fiery fagots
of thoſe dayes were not ſo grievous then, as the ſlandrous tongues be now in our dayes.
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar made a Law, that if any did blaspheme the God of Sidrach, Miſach, and
Abednego, he ſhould be ſlaine, and his houſe made a dunghill. Moſes made a law, that every
blaſphemer ſhould be ſtoned to death.</hi> Seeing God and Princes have made ſuch ſtraight Laws
againſt ſuch lewd railers, good Rulers ſhould ſee ſome correction done, and not with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to ſuffer ill men to talke their pleaſure on Gods City, Religion and miniſtry: while
others poſſibly made courteſie to ſpeak and anſwer theſe buſie braggers and quarrelers,
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſteppeth forth boldly, defendeth this cauſe ſtoutly; anſwereth their falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
truly, incourageth the people manfully to go forward with their work, deſpiſeth
their brags and telleth them plainly, <hi>that they have no part, nor right, nor are worthie
to be remembred in Ieruſalem.</hi> The effect of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> anſwer was, that the God of
heaven had given them good ſucceſſe hitherto in moving the hearts of King <hi>Cirus</hi> and
<hi>Darius</hi> firſt to the building of the Temple, and now of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to reſtore the City:
they were his ſervants, and worſhipped him, and he ſtirred them up to this work, for of
themſelves they were not able to do ſuch things. They ſerved no Idols nor falſe Gods,
they needed not to be aſhamed of their maſter, the God of heaven was their Lord, and
they his people, he was their Maſter and they his ſervants, he their King, and they his
ſubjects, they would go forward with their work, they muſt have a City to dwell in to
ſerve their God, who would defend them in this their wel doing: theſe men had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to ſtop or forbid them to worke, they had nothing to do in Jeruſalem, nor any
authority, they would not obey them, but with all diligence apply this work until it be
finiſhed. T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſaid, <hi>they muſt obey God that bad them,</hi> thus muſt all they, that take Gods work in hand,
confeſſe it to come from God, and that he bleſſeth their doings, that all the praiſe may be
his, and that they of themſelves be weak and unable to doe ſuch things, without his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

men had had any worldly ſhame or fear of God in them, they would have quaked and
trembled, as the good men rejoyced to heare God on their ſide to further them, ſo they,
when they heard <hi>the God of heaven</hi> named to be againſt them, and that it was his doing,
they would have forſaken their Idols, and have furthered thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> building, or at leaſt have
ſitten ſtil, and not hindered it. For who is able to withſtand his will, or hinder that he
wil have forward? The devils in hel quake and tremble at the naming and conſidering of
Gods Majeſty, but theſe wicked Imps not only now, but ſundry times as appeareth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in this book, moſt cruelly, ſpitefully and craftily go forward in their old malice, and
by al means ſeek the overthrow of this building, ſo far worſe is a devil incarnate in an ill
man, then by himſelfe in his own nature. When the Devil wil worke any great miſchief,
he taketh commonly one man or other, Angel or creature to doe it by, knowing
that hee ſhall doe it more eaſily that way, then if he ſhould attempt it by him-
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124937:4"/>
himſelfe. How is every murther, falſe witneſſe, whoredome, robbery, &amp;c. committed,
but when the Devill ſtirreth up one man againſt another; Let every good man therefore
take heed unto himſelfe, how he yeeldeth unto ſin. For in ſo doing, he maketh himſelfe a
ſlave to the Devill, and his inſtrument to worke by. One Devill will not offer that villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to another Divel, to make him his ſlave, but if he can bring men unto it, there is his
rejoycing. Take heed therefore, O man. In that they confeſſe themſelves to be <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the God of Heaven:</hi> it is as much to ſay, as they wrought not for themſelves, nor
at their owne appointment, nor for their own profit, they wrought for their maſters
cauſe, and for his glory. Gods ſervants in all their doings will ſeek their maſters profit
and praiſe, not their owne: they live not for themſelves, but all the profit of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
returneth to their Maſters. If they take any thing to themſelves more then their
maſter giveth them, they be theeves unto him, they do him no true ſervice. Let all the
builders of Gods houſe therefore, whether they be rulers in the Common-wealth, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>
was now, or of the learned ſort in the Miniſtry, or elſewhere, not only confeſſe
in words that they be <hi>ſervants to the God of heaven,</hi> but moſt humbly, ſimply, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew it in their deeds, that they ſeek their maſters praiſe and glory, the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of their Country and not their own, that they worke for him and not for themſelves,
and that they ſerve him not for any worldly reſpect, or gaine, or honour, but uprightly
for conſcience ſake ſerve and obey him, yeeld all praiſe to his glorious name, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to themſelves, and being not afraid to go forward in his building for any braggers,
knowing that all the pride of mans heart, which ſetteth up himſelfe againſt the God of
Heaven, is vile and vaine, and that their God will defend his ſervants and confound his
foes. It is no rebellion againſt Princes to do that which God commandeth: for Princes
themſelves are bonnd as well as other meaner degrees to ſerve the Lord God of Heave<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with all their might and maine, and unto the ſame God they muſt make account of their
doings as all other muſt. For this building they had the Kings Commiſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was no Treaſon to do it: It is more glorious to be called Gods ſervants, then to
have all the titles of honour and dignity that the world can give. He that ſerveth the
Lord truly is maſter of ſin, hell, death and the divell, and by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy
ſpirit ſhall not be overcome of them, but ſhall overcome and conquer them: which is a
greater honour then any worldly Prince can give. The woman that had an evill ſpirit in
her, confeſſed <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellowes <hi>to be the ſervants of the mighty God, and that they
taught them the way of ſalvation, Acts</hi> 16. See then how devils are affraid of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
<hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epiſtles rejoyceth in nothing more then terming himſelfe <hi>an Apoſtle
and ſervant of Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> The holy Ghoſt told <hi>Paul, Acts 20. that in every City where
he ſhould come, there were chayns and troubles ready for him: but he ſaid he cared not for them
for his life was not dear to him, ſo that he might run his race, and teſtifie the glorious Gospel
of God.</hi> Be not aſhamed of thy maſter: for our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that whoſoever deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him before men, he will deny him before his father in Heaven.</hi> Worldly maſters will
not caſt a way their faithfull ſervants, but maintaine them as they may, and thinkeſt thou
that God will forſake his ſervants? Thinkeſt thou a mortall wretched man to be more
loving to thee then the eternall God and mercifull father that made thee, feedeth thee, and
defendeth thee, when man cannot help thee? yea loveth the better then thou loveſt thy
ſelfe, and ſtayeth thee from running from him, when thou wouldeſt willingly ſeek thine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124937:4"/>
own deſtruction wilfully. Stand to him boldly, forſake him not cowardly. <hi>Polycarpus,</hi>
an old man, <hi>when he ſhould ſuffer martyrdome, was adviſed by ſome to have pitie on his
old age, and not ſo ſtiffely to ſtand out. Nay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have ſerved my Maſter Chriſt
theſe 86. yeares, and he did me never harme, I will not forſake him now in my laſt dayes.</hi>
Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſtoutly anſwering them, and boldly incouraging his fellowes, goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with the work, contemneth their mocking and falſe accuſations, and falleth to his
building again; ſo muſt all good builders of Gods houſe neither be afraid nor weary of
ſcornfull mockers, threatnings, accuſations or violence, but manfully go forwards to the
end, knowing that their God is ſtronger, wiſer, and more willing to defend his people,
then his enemies ſhall be to hurt them. <hi>He that putteth his hand to the plough, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
backward, is not meet for the Kingdome of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Luke 9. And
he that continueth to the end ſhalbe ſafe, Mat.</hi> 25. 20. Our Saviour Chriſt, when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
that <hi>whatſoever went in at the mouth did not defile a man,</hi> was told by his diſciples,
that that doctrine offended the Phariſees: but he anſwered them and ſaid, <hi>Every plant
that my father hath not planted ſhalbe plucked up,</hi> &amp;c. As though he ſhould ſay, their
doctrine is not from my Father, and therefore cannot ſtand: let thoſe blind guides alone,
ſeeing they wilbe wilful and obſtinate, and will not learn: go ye forward with preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goſpel, care not for them. So every good man muſt continue that he may ſay
with S. <hi>Paul, I have kept my faith, I have run my race, the crown of righteouſneſſe is laid
up in ſtore for me, &amp;c.</hi> After that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had thus boldly anſwered them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
his countrey-men to their work, he now turneth him to <hi>Sanballat</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and ſheweth himſelfe to make as little account of them, as they made of him,
and ſaith: <hi>As for you, ye have no right, part, nor remembrance in Ieruſalem:</hi> as though
he ſhould ſay, what have you to do with us in this building? ye are not <hi>Iewes</hi> borne,
as wee bee, yee belong not to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor are partakers of his bleſſing. Yee bee <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi>
ſtrangers to his City and common-wealth, ye be none of Gods houſhold:
if ye will be doing, meddle where ye have to do. This City God himſelfe did chuſe for
his people to dwell in, and ſerve him. Ye be idolaters, and worſhip not the true God of
heaven: if ye will be building, build ye <hi>Samaria</hi> your own head City: ye are no Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
here, nor have any freedome, liberty or priviledge granted unto us, ye be none of
our corporation, nor denizons, ye ſhall have nothing to do here. All that build here, have
their portion of land and living in this city and countrey appointed for them: they ſhall
have juſtice, right and law miniſtred unto them, and for a perpetuall remembrance of their
faithfull ſervice unto the living God, their names ſhalbe regiſtred, that all poſterity may
know their doings, and praiſe the Lord that ſtrengthened them to this building: but ye
have none of all theſe: for when the land was divided by lot and meaſure by <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> ye
had no part appointed for you: under the Law ye do not live, but have lived after your
own device; nay, ye beare ſuch hatred unto us, that ye will not willingly eat, drink,
nor keep company with us friendly: let us alone, trouble us not, get you hence, and let
us fall to our building again. It is no ſmall bleſſing of God when he calleth any to be a
builder of his houſe, for both in this world his name ſhalbe had in perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and he is written in the book of life, where no death can prevaile. <hi>David</hi> ſaith,
<hi>The righteous man ſhalbe had in perpetuall remembrance, Pſal.</hi> 112. and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>He that is not found written in the booke of life, ſhall be caſt into the fierie lake, Rev.</hi> 20.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124937:5"/>
The builders of this city now have their names written in the next Chapter following
for their perpetuall praiſe in this world, to teach us that as the builders of this worldly
Jeruſalem have their names regiſtred here, much more the builders of the heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
have their names written in the Book of life for their ſalvation. Ill men and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
of Gods building have their names written in this book too. What more bleſſed
then is he that hindreth? <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth and ſaith: <hi>The remembrance of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is to his praiſe, but the name of the wicked ſtinketh.</hi> This is then the difference, and
thou mayeſt chuſe whether thou wilt be remembred to thy praiſe, or to thy ſhame, and
with the good will of the living, or hatred. But by this anſwer of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he
ſaith, that <hi>they have no part, right, nor remembrance in Ieruſalem,</hi> it is partly given us to
underſtand, that when they could not hinder this work by big brags and threatnings,
they offered themſelves to joyn with them in this building, to take their part, and beare
the charges fellow-like: for why ſhould he deny them theſe, except they required it.
But <hi>Nehemiah</hi> a wiſe man would neither be afraid of them, as open enemies nor receive
them into his fellowſhip, as feigned friends: wherein he teacheth all true Chriſtians
how to behave themſelves in building of Gods houſe: that is, neither to fear the one, nor
to receive the other. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be not yoked with infidels: what hath righteouſneſſe to
do with unrighteouſneſſe, light with darkneſſe, or Chriſt with Belial?</hi> Gods people are
knit together with two bonds, the one is Chriſt their head, who giveth life to all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body, the other is brotherly love among themſelves: but neither of theſe
can be found in Idolaters; for they neither take Chriſt for their head and live by him, nor
they love not Chriſtians as their brethren, but diſſemble with God and man. All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
have <hi>one God, one faith, one baptiſme,</hi> one Religion, one law to live under, and one
heavenly Kingdome to look for: but infidels and hypocrites have many gods, all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be alike unto them, they live as they liſt, and that is their law and will, to go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
after their own device, if they can get it. Yet they have a delight to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in among Gods people, pretending a love unto them, where indeed it is for no
good will, but to learn their ſecret counſels and purpoſes, that by ſuch means they may
betray them when occaſion ſerveth. But wiſe builders wil admit them into no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
nor friendſhip, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here utterly refuſeth them, and wil have nothing to do
with them. But this caſe is more plainly propounded to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and there I have ſpoken
more largely of it, and <hi>Ezra</hi> plainly determineth the matter there, who ſo liſt to read
and conſider. God be praiſed.</p>
