         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It is evident by our own
examples, that for the moſt
part, the Civil or Forreign
Armies that have oppreſſed
this State, have been either
bred out of our firſt attempting
of others, or out of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Nobility &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
either wearied with the
toil and charge, or feared with
the effect of Tyranny, which
might corrupt the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of their King, or elſe (a
plague no leſſe of war) that the
better ſort inured to command
abroad, have forgotten to obey
at home, and the inferiour by
living there upon rapine and
purchaſe, unwilling here to
tye themſelves again to order
and induſtry.</p>
                  <p>There is in the Regiſter of State no time that
ſo well expreſſeth either the danger or damage
we underwent in waking an adverſary,<note place="margin">Examples of Invaſion drawn from the attempts of others.</note> as that of
<hi>Edward</hi> the third. Out of many examples I
will ſelect ſome few, beginning with the tenth of
his reign; at what time his intention was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſomewhat in <hi>France,</hi> but diverted by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
who, muſtring <hi>in partibus Britanniae ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadendum

<hi>Britany</hi> to invade the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> a
puiſſant Army,<note place="margin">Ex Rot. Scotiae anno 10. E. 3. m. 14.</note> enforced <hi>Edward</hi> the third to fall
from his firſt purpoſe, and inſiſt upon his own
guard: for which cauſe, to the infinite charge
of himſelf and people, he levied 80000. men
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37232:8"/>
out of the Shires of this Kingdome. To withdraw
his forces from <hi>France,</hi> in the thirteenth of his
reigne, they invaded the Realm, and burned the
Towns of <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> places
that ſuffered from the ſame motive the like
calamity.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, after the

Army of forty thouſand men at armes, and forty
thouſand foot, ſharing by idle contracts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
with his confederates not the ſpoils on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but the Kingdome it ſelf: the Honour and
ſome other portion of benefits he reſerved as his

in pure alms he voweth to the Church of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> and to the <hi>French</hi> King an yearly
tributary Fee of twenty thouſand pound. In
theſe termes this Realm ſtood almoſt all the time
of <hi>Edward</hi> the third.</p>
                  <p>The Coaſt-dwellers were ſo frighted from
their habitation, as in the thirteenth year the king
commanded the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi>

                  <p>It was no whit altered under his ſucceſſour <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>

For retaining nothing <hi>ex paterna Majeſtate

by leading the eaſy King by Expence into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
For beſides the Reſumptions he took of
his own and Fathers Grants, (which was of

6. Tenths, whereof one for 3. yeares, beſides 3.
Moieties, and one third; of fifteens 3. halfs, one

4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of <hi>Deniſons,</hi> and 53. ſhil. 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of <hi>Aliens.</hi> The

it was ever a perpetuall iſſue of the Treaſure of

commodious for a potent enemy to intercept, then
our ſelves to ſecure. For how large ſoever any

Speed: And thoſe Forms are moſt quick and
eaſy in motion, whole extremes are all equally

which is once ill, is alwayes accounted ſuch;
from whence is begot in us that quality which
we call <hi>Experience,</hi> whereby wiſe men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed

The Charity which <hi>France</hi> hath teſtified to
pacify our differences is ſo great that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
incredible, ſo unſeaſonable that it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
and ſo contrary to their former proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that it is quite otherwayes underſtood.
Philoſophers ſay, we cannot paſſe from one
extremity to another without ſome mean; I
cannot ſee by what ſteps they are come to this
perfect goodneſs, nor what good <hi>Genius</hi> can
have made them in an inſtant ſo good friends
of ſuch dangerous neighbours to us. I will
paſſe my cenſure upon nothing, yet let me
have the liberty to judge of all. I find ſo
great a wonder in this change, that I find a
conflict in my ſelf to believe it. It is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
marvell, that thoſe who have for ſo long
a time beheld all <hi>Europe</hi> in a flame, and could
not be moved by the bloud and destruction of
ſo many people to caſt thereon one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould now have their bowells ſo tender as
to compaſſionate the diſſenſions ariſing in a
corner of the world which hath alwayes bin
fatall to them; That thoſe who have made it
their chiefeſt intereſt to divide us, ſhould now
make it their glory to reunite us; That thoſe
who place their reſt in our troubles, ſhould
now apply their cares for our repoſe; and that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37232:52"/>
after they have caſt us down headlong, they
ſhould reach us a plank for to come aſhore.
Let the wiſe Reader here (whilſt I determine
nothing) allow me at leaſt a little diſtruſt;
it is the Mother of Safety. The <hi>Trojans,</hi> who
could not be overcome by Armes, periſh't by
a pledge of peace. All the <hi>French</hi> civilityes are
faire and good; but in the bottome
<q>Quicquid id eſt, timeo Gallos, &amp; dona fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſee what reaſons can oblige them to
intereſt themſelves ſo paſſionately in our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Is it Religion? ſurely no; for that which
they profeſſe is contrary to that of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and the little Charity they have for
their own, ought not to perſwade us that they
have much for ours. Is it for the inclination
they have to peace? ſurely no; for if they
eſteemed it a benefit, they would ſeek firſt
for themſelves. It is perhaps for an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of their obligations to us in the late
warres, and for the aſſiſtance we gave to thoſe
of <hi>Rochel.</hi> I, his would be truely Chriſtian
indeed, to render us good for evill. They will
ſay that they are the bands of blood and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
which bind them to the <hi>Queen;</hi> and
yet they have let the Mother beg her ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37232:53"/>
and retreat among ſtrangers which ſhe
could not find with them? and having beheld
her without pitty and ſuccour in her greatest
extremities, they adviſe to offer her a remedy
upon the declining of her ill. But if this be the
reaſon of their admittance, I conceive them no
lawfull nor indifferent Mediators, ſince they
are ſo much concern'd in one of the parties.
They will whiſper us in the eare, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
is to pacify us, and to ingage us in a
league with them againſt the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
at the ſame time they deſigne Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
for <hi>Munſter</hi> to endeavour a peace with
him. O, we ſhould wrong them very much to
believe it, though they might ſeem in an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to deſire it of us; They are too gallant
ſpirited to pretend it, they know that we are
better adviſed then to ſerve them to pull their
Cheſnut out of the fire; that a body recovering
health from a long ſickneſſe ought not to expoſe
it ſelf to a violent agitation; that the State will
find it ſelf loaden with debts, and the Subject
exhauſted by Contributions; that we ought to
preferre the evident profit of traffick before the
uncertain vanity of a conqueſt; that Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
being not yet removed, nor aemulations
ſuppreſt, all kind of arming would be ſuſpected
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37232:53"/>
by the State, fearing leaſt ſome under pretenſe
of a forrain warre might ſtudy private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
or the oppreſſion of the publick liberty;
&amp; that in the end it will be our gain to ſee them
deal with <hi>Spain,</hi> and to make our advantage of
their troubles, or not to meddle at all with
them, unleſſe by adding ſecretly (according to
the revolution of affairs) a little weight to
them that ſhall be found the lighter. If then it
be none of theſe motives, it remains that it
muſt be either Generoſity, or deceit. O <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity</hi>
(that haſt ſo long ſince withdrawn
thy ſelf to heaven, there to keep company with
the faire. <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> or rather, who wer't buried in
<hi>France</hi> in the Sepulchre of Monſieur <hi>Gonin</hi>)
is it poſſible that thou ſhouldſt be riſen again,
or that <hi>France</hi> ſhould have recall'd thee with
her exiles ſince the death of her King; and
that the firſt labour ſhe ſhould put thee to
ſhould be in favour of <hi>England,</hi> againſt whom
but few dayes ſince ſhe ſhewed ſuch violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments,
for an offence received by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
violation of the treaties which had paſt
between us? Truely if it be ſhe, we muſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
her with extraordinary reſpects; but
before we give her the Honours due unto her,
we muſt know her, for feare of Idolatry in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37232:54"/>
adoring her maſque for her ſelf, or embracing
a cloud in ſtead of a Goddeſſe. Let us give
a thruſt with our launce into the <hi>Trojan</hi> horſe,
to ſee if there be no ambuſh within.</p>
                  <p>In walking lately with ſome <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(as this nation is free enough of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
a word eſcaped from one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
without making reflexion (as I think) of
what Countrey I was, That amongſt their
Prophets there was one which ſaid, That <hi>the
Conqueſt of England was promiſed to their
young King.</hi> This thought caſt into the aire
though inconſideratly, ſeemed to me very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
and having given me an occaſion to
reflect upon all things both paſt and preſent, it
ſerved me as a light to guide me in the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this Labyrinth, upon which before I
had reaſoned but ſuperficially, From thence
being returned to my lodging, I opened acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
a book of Monſieur <hi>de Rohan,</hi> intitled <hi>The
intereſt of the Princes of Chriſtendome,</hi> and I
fell preſently upon a paſſage where he ſaid, That
one of the ſureſt wayes to make ones ſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of a State, is to interpoſe and make himſelf
arbiter of its differences. I had no need of any
other <hi>Oedipus</hi> to expound to me the riddle of
the Propheſy, theſe firſt motives of ſuſpicion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37232:54"/>
having caſt me into more profound thoughts, I
revolved in my mind how <hi>France</hi> had managed
the whole buſineſs, both before &amp; ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our troubles, and weighed all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of this Ambaſſage. Why ſuch a
ſolemne Ambaſſage in a time when all things
ſeem moſt exaſperated and furtheſt from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation?
Why then not ſooner, while dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
were not yet irreconcileable between
the two parties? Why ſuch a warlike Prince,
who is not experienced in the affaires of this
Kingdome, to manage a negotiation of a peace
the moſt nice and intricate that the world at
this time affords? Why at the ſame time levying
of Souldiers in <hi>Normandy,</hi> when all the other
troops are in their quarters? Why therefore
ſhould they ſupply one of the parties with mony,
when they come to act the perſons of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
if not to caſt wood and oyle into the flame?
Why at the ſame time an Agent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who
propounds to them openly a League with <hi>France?</hi>
Why begin they onely to turn their cares upon
<hi>England,</hi> when they are upon the point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
a peace with <hi>Spain?</hi> May not we
well judge that it is to prepare themſelves for
a new employment? ſince they themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that their boiling and unquiet temper hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37232:55"/>
need of continuall exerciſe, and that the onely
means to prevent troubles at home, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to furniſh them with matter whereupon
to evacuate their choler abroad. Why doth
onely <hi>France</hi> afford us this ſo ſuddain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Charity, after all the freſh wounds
which bleed yet among them becauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> after the continuall
cares ſhe hath taken for ſo many years to lay
the foundation of our troubles by the ſecret ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
of the Marquis of <hi>Blainville,</hi> by the
intriques of the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> with
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> by the long plots in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and, by the open ſollicitations of the Marquis
<hi>de la Fert?</hi> by all which they ſometimes incited
the Kings miniſters to make him independent
and abſolute, offering to that purpoſe their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and anone they ſollicited the States to
ſhake off the yoak of ſervitude, finally they
transformed themſelves into a thouſand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſhapes, till having plunged us deep enough
in the gulf, they then call back their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
to give in appearance ſome ſatisfaction to
the King, but in truth becauſe his commiſſion
was expired. May not we well conclude from all
this, that they will now reape the fruits they have
ſo carefully ſown and cultivated amongſt us?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37232:55"/>
From theſe conſiderations falling inſenſibly on
thoſe of <hi>England?</hi> what need (ſaid I in my
ſelf) have we of the intermeddling of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?
are they more verſed in our intereſts then
our ſelves? can they afford more expedients?
are they more ſenſible of our miſeries then thoſe
that ſuffer them? Is it to exhort us, or to
conſtrain us? the firſt is ſuperfluous; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
dangerous. It muſt needs be that either in
the one caſe they think to go beyond us in wit, or
in the other to maſter us by force. If peace be
profitable for us, have we any need either of a
Maſter to make us know our advantage, or of
an Oratour to perſwade us to it? If it be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to us, we ought to give them thanks for
their advice, but follow that which is better. If
the peace be feaſible, why ſhould we leave the
glory of it to others? if impoſsible, why looſe
time in making vain propoſitions? why ſhould
we acquaint ſtrong and ambitious neighbours,
and truſt the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> with the ſecret of our
force? Muſt <hi>England,</hi> that hath in times paſt
compelled <hi>France</hi> to purchaſe peace, be now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to beg it of her? that one of the moſt
conſiderable and flouriſhing Monarchies of the
world ſhould ſerve for matter of ſport to the
vanity of the <hi>French,</hi> and be the firſt upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37232:56"/>
whom they exerciſe the Title they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of being Arbiters of Chriſtendome?
What Counſel then ſhall we follow in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter?
That of good and wiſe Nature, who
having ſeparated us from all other Nations by a
vast and deep trench, ſilently teacheth us, that
the principle of our ſubſiſtence is in our ſelves,
and that we ought not to ſubmit our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the arbitrement of others.</p>
