         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

she had to Complain of her <hi>Bedfellow's Incapacity.</hi> Labouring for some
time under these Struglings of Conscience, at last I bethought my self
of an Old Story, which remov'd my Scruples, and restor'd me to my
former Resolution of Pursuing the Intrigue. And that you may not be
Unacquainted with this Balsamick Tale, so Excellent for Strengthening a
Weak and Tender Conscience, I have here given it by the Way; in hopes
not to <hi>Corrupt</hi> the Reader, but to make him <hi>Merry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Batchelor Gentleman, of Good Estate, desiring, thro' Covetousness, to encrease
his Riches, apply'd himself to a Young Lady of Great Fortune; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Estate was somewhat inferiour to her Portion, yet the Comeliness of
his Person, and his Engaging Accomplishments soon prevail'd upon the Lady
to become his Bride, who having nothing before her Eyes but the Prospect of a
Happy Life, and the Comfortable Embraces of a Gentleman of Sweet Temper, Affable
Behaviour, Incomparable Wit, and Excellent Proportion, insomuch she gave
him but very little Trouble to bring his Design to its propos'd Issue: So that they
were soon Marryed, and Bedded accordingly, with all the Solemnities and Formalities
of a Publick Nupital. But as soon as the Frolicksome Company had quitted the Bridal
Chamber, the Gentleman in his Minority having reciev'd a Kick from a Horse, which
Occasion'd his Castration, was render'd incapable of gratifying the Expectancies of his
Panting Bride, Concluding it the best Way to Discover his Infirmities, and put her
past the thought of what is Natural in such a Case for the most Modest Woman to
expect, which he accordingly discover'd, but with as much Art and Rhetorick as was
possible to be us'd, to take off the Impression of so great a Disappointment, telling her,
That tho himself was <hi>Impotent,</hi> he would grant her the Liberty of making good
his <hi>Deficiency</hi> to herself, by choosing any other Person to be her Confident,
that should be most agreeable to her own Inclinations. The Young Lady fearing
this might be some Trick of her Husbands to sift whether any other Person
had any share in her Affections, made a Iest of his Discovery, and suspended
her Choice till after a further time of Consideration: But found at last she was
brought in Good-Earnest into this Misfortune; and being not a little Vneasy under
this Intollerable Disappointment, began to be thoughtfully intent upon the freedom
that was given her by her <hi>Impotent Bridegroom:</hi> And observing his <hi>Butler</hi>
to be a handsome Iolly Young Fellow, Looking as if he was well Qualified for
so pleasing a Task, insomuch that she resolved to pitch upon him to supply the
Deficiency of her Vnhappy Husband, and accordingly acquaints him with what
Choice she had made; with which the Gentleman seem'd very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented;
and sending for his <hi>Butler</hi> into his Closet, inform'd him of the
whole Affair, with all its Circumstances; telling him he would allow him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94930:3"/>
an Hundred Pounds a Year, as long as he would take Care, thro' Secresie and
Prudence, to prevent any Disreputation that otherways might by his carelesness fall
upon the Family. The <hi>Butler,</hi> over-joy'd at this Proposal, made so many fair
Promises and Protestations, that the Master was well Satisfied, and thought
him a proper Confident for his purpose: So accordingly Lodg'd him in a Room
near his own Bed-chamber, that his Lady without Danger of Detection, might
change her Bedfellow as often as her Inclinations led her. This Good-Natur'd
Liberty of the Gentlemans was mutually enjoy'd, between his Wife and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
for a considerable time, without either Discovery or Mistrust; till at last,
the Lady on a Summers day, having added an unusual Warmth to her youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Desires by a Glass or two of Rich Wine at Dinner, above her ordinary
Custome, went into the Buttery, where the Butler was alone in the Afternoon,
taking a Lazy Nap to indulge his Idleness. The Lady shuting the Door, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd
her Gallant, and soon made him sensible, by intelligible Signs, of what
her Ladyship wanted.</p>
            <p>He rubbing his Eyes, and speedily understanding her Meaning by her Gaping,
laid her down with a Finger and a Thumb, upon a Lolling Convenience, in
Order to Oblige her: In which Interim, the <hi>Chaplain</hi> being dry after his Dinner,
came to the Buttery Door, and knock'd for Admittance into the Cellar. The <hi>Butler</hi>
being too deeply Engag'd to answer, the Parson Iudg'd by his Silence, he was
making much of some of his Friends in Private; and having a mind to be Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
peep'd thro' the Key-hole, and beheld with the Eyes of Truth, the sad Shame
and Dishonour his Lady and the Butler, by the Instigations of the Devil, had
brought upon the Family; and immediately Runs open-mouth'd to his Patron, and
acquaints him, with a Sorowful Countenance, by what a Providential Accident
he had stood <hi>Pimp</hi> to his Ladies Debauchery, setting forth the Villany and Treachery
of his Servant in thus abusing of him.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman being concern'd at their Imprudence, to be thus Foolishly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
had no way left to excuse the Matter, but to tell the Truth, and discover
his own Infirmity; also that it was done by his Inducement and Permission; and
that he allow'd the <hi>Butler</hi> a hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to recompence his
Diligence, and enjoyn him to Secresie. <hi>Lord, Sir,</hi> says the Chaplain, <hi>Why would
you not imploy me? I'd have done it for Fifty with all my Heart, and have
Read Prayers Twice a Day into the Bargain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I rightly applying the <hi>Moral</hi> of this Story, rid my Conscience of those
Doubts and Fears that would otherwise have retarded me from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
so fair an Opportunity; that I began now to query with my
self, which was the most inexcusable Fault, to commit the Sin, or disoblige
the Lady; and remembring Ingratitude to be stil'd the worst of Crimes,
and that to disoblige a pretty Woman in distress, and slight her Favours
so generously thrown upon me, was Ingratitude; I soon reason'd my
self into a compliance with my Mistress in Elect's Desires; and took
up a Sturdy Resolution of meeting my bold Challenger at the Place
appointed.</p>
            <p>When the happy Morning came, and nothing but <hi>Cuckold-makers,
Cuckoldome, Cuckolds,</hi> and <hi>Horn-Fair,</hi> were the common discourses of every
Sober Citizen to his next Neighbour, as soon as the Shops were open'd,
I getting up an Hour before my time, had recourse to the Barbers, that
my Face and Perriwig might not want the Advantages of his nice ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
but have all the Effeminate Improvement of Powder,
Washball and Perfume, that I might be as Fragrant to my Mistresses
Nostrills, as a <hi>Bermoodoes</hi> Breez, and smell as Odiferous as any sweet-Bag.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94930:4"/>
When I was thus Wash'd, Curl'd, and Comb'd, like any Ladies Lap-Dog;
and after I had spent as much time in Dressing, as a <hi>Merchants-Wife</hi>
on a Sunday before <hi>Church-time,</hi> I did at last judge by my Glass
I was a very compleat Figure to make an Amour, tho' to a squeamish
Lady. My Shoes were as black as <hi>Spanish-Balls</hi> could make 'em, and
Shin'd like a Physicians Ebony Cane new rub'd upon a Visit to an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman.
My Stockins were garter'd up as tite as a <hi>Boot</hi> upon a <hi>Last,</hi>
and stuck as close to my <hi>Calves</hi> as a <hi>Bag</hi> to a <hi>Boild-Pudding.</hi> My Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being as hard girted as a <hi>Fillet</hi> bound for Bleeding, that I did
more pennance than a Man half Throtled to be prick'd in the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
My Knees hoop'd round with Rowles, turn'd up with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness,
that a <hi>Wedding Ring</hi> upon a Citizens Wives <hi>Thumb,</hi> could no
ways sit more precisely Regular. My <hi>Breeches</hi> stuck so close to the
Ignoblest of my Flesh, that I durst not Stride an Inch beyond the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
bounds of my Taylor, without the danger of a Rent; and when
I came to a broad Kennel I was forc'd to Wade thro, because I could
not venture to step over without Damage. My <hi>Coat</hi> was Cut <hi>All-amode
a Paree,</hi> with Skirts not much longer than those of a <hi>Water-mans Iacket.</hi>
My <hi>Linnen</hi> was made by an <hi>Inns-of-Court-Sempstress,</hi> and was Digitiz'd
with her <hi>Handle-Bauble</hi> Fingers, into as much Formality as a Ladies <hi>Head-Dress.</hi>
My <hi>Wig,</hi> like the rest of the Fools, was so woundily be-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that whenever the Wind sat in my Face, it endanger'd the Eyes
of him that walk'd behind me. Which procur'd me as many <hi>Curses</hi> in
a Day, as a Good Man has <hi>Prayers</hi> for his Charity. My <hi>Hat</hi> was in the
<hi>Mathematical Cock,</hi> with the Brims tuck'd up to the Crown, into an exact
Triangle. My <hi>Gloves</hi> were right <hi>Cordivant,</hi> and stunk so of <hi>Muscovy</hi>
Cats-Turd, that Persons subject to Vapours started from me as I walk'd
(like a <hi>Beau</hi> from a <hi>Chimney-Sweeper</hi>) for fear of being Suffocated. Thus
equip'd according to the Nice Rules of Foppery and Courtship, I went
along, Cursing the Rudeness of the Wind, that at every Street's Corner
ruffled the Curles of my Wig into some disorder, being forc'd to give
as many stroaks to each Bushy side as a <hi>Milk-Woman</hi> does to a <hi>Cows Teat</hi>
at a Meal, to reduce the stragling Hairs into their proper Places: Till
at last, with a Panting Heart, like a dispirited Lover, I came to the Place
appointed; where, with as much Courage as I could Summon together,
I ask'd for my Lady, who was not yet come. I thinking it my Duty to
wait, rather than hers, it made me Careful to be something Earlier <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the Time prefix'd, to manifest my Diligence, as well as the eager Desires
I had to her Dear Company. I bid 'em show me a Room, and then
call'd for a Pint of <hi>Canary,</hi> as the most Amorous Cordial I could think
on, over which, I sat near half an hour, sometimes <hi>Disheartening</hi> my self
with the thoughts of being <hi>Iilted,</hi> than <hi>Comforting</hi> my self up with the
assurance of her <hi>Sincerity,</hi> from some little knowledge I had of her Person.
At last, to remove my Doubts and Jealousies, in steps my Lady, Dress'd
up with as much Art, as if all the <hi>Tyre-Women</hi> in both <hi>Exchanges</hi> had
been her <hi>Chamber-Maids.</hi> But, to tell you the Truth on't, finding her
no more afraid of Tumbling her <hi>Pinners,</hi> than I was of Rumpling my
<hi>Cravat,</hi> our greeting was so mutually kind and satisfactory, That it would
have made the Readers Heart go <hi>Pit-a-Pat</hi> to have seen our Loving Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
She beging Pardon for her Presumption, and desiring my good
Construction of the Freedom she had taken. I answering her in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Dialect, That her Company was the only Happiness I had long
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94930:4"/>
Covetted; and had not the <hi>Conjugal Obligations</hi> she lay under frighted
me from Discovering my <hi>Love,</hi> she long before now should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
sufficient Testimonies of my unextinguishable Affections; or had
I in the least known the just Reasons she had to withdraw her Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and alienate that <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> remaining in her Dear self
from her <hi>Marriage-Bed,</hi> no Addresses and Importunities should have been
wanting from her humble Servant, to have happily supply'd those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencies,
which, according to the Laws both Divine and Humane,
she might Modestly Complain of.</p>
            <p>In such a sort of Amorous Discourses, we express'd the Impatient
Desires of each other. I well knowing nothing takes more with the
<hi>Fair-Sex,</hi> under these Circumstances, than to put a Gloss upon the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
For he that has but the true Knack of extenuating a Crime,
will have no great difficulty in drawing those to the Guilt, who give
Credit to his Doctrine. Having now, by a few Love-Toys, and Light
Expressions, together with the assistance of the Wine, introduc'd a little
Familiarity, we agreed upon a Dish of Fish, that we might fortifie our
Stomachs against the Cold Breezes we must expect upon the Water.
During the Time the <hi>Cook</hi> was Labouring to Delight our Pallats, we
Reciprocally oblig'd each other with Lushious Kisses and Endearing
Words, that melted both our Hearts into an equal Concupiscence of Loves
Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>Citizens and their Mates, Swarm now to the Water-side, in order
to take Boat for the <hi>Horn-headed Rendezvouz</hi> at <hi>Charlton:</hi> And nothing
being heard beneath our Window, but the Wrangling of Water-Men
about their Fairs, and the Noisie Mouthing Acclamations of <hi>Greenwich,
Greenwich Ho,</hi> That had we been Seated at the <hi>Hockly-Hole-Theatre,</hi> when
the Blind-Bear had been let loose, our Ears could not have been terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with more discording Out-Cries. Upon which we arose from our
Seats, and mov'd to the Window, to divert our selves a little with see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Batchelour Cuckold-Makers</hi> and <hi>Citizens Wives;</hi> also <hi>City Cuckolds,</hi>
and their <hi>Maiden-Looking Mistresses,</hi> stow themselves as close in a Boat
together, as they do in a <hi>Cheap-side Ballcony,</hi> at my <hi>Lord-Mayors-Show,</hi> to
gaze like a Drove of <hi>Bullocks,</hi> between one anothers Horns, at the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of the City. The first Couple that I happen'd to know, pressing
amongst the Crowd to board their <hi>Double-handed Wherry,</hi> were a <hi>Iewish
Wine-Merchant</hi> and a <hi>Vintners Wife;</hi> who, I suppose, thro' the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
they took in <hi>Cuckold-Making,</hi> went to do Reverence to <hi>Cuckolds-Point;</hi>
and from thence to buy a <hi>Horn-Tumbler</hi> at the Fair to Drink the
Husbands Health in; and so recal the Pleasures of their past Sins, by
the Sweetness of reflection. My Lady observing I had added a more
than ordinary Chearfulness to my Countenance, requir'd the reason of
my Smiling. I told her I could not forbear Laughing to see a <hi>Iew</hi>
scatter his Affections out of his Tribe, and make so much of a <hi>Christian;</hi>
and to find a <hi>City Dame,</hi> with so good a Conscience, to have so much
Charity for an <hi>Vnbeliever.</hi> That Lady, said I, that you see with the
<hi>Iew,</hi> is a very great Meeter, and a Mighty Religious Christain in her Way,
having as Jolly a Man to her Husband as a Woman would desire to lie
by. But I find, notwithstanding her seeming sanctity, she loves <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi>
much better than <hi>Christian Baptism.</hi> At which Information my
Lady lifted up her Eyes, expressing her self after this manner, <hi>Bless me!
What is the World come to! That a Woman should be so Wicked! As if there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94930:5"/>
were not Good</hi> Christians <hi>enough deserving of a Womans Favours, but, like
a Prophane Minx, she must bestow her Kindness on a</hi> Jew! <hi>Well, I would not
be in her Condition, and have such a Sin to answer for, for the World. If I
should, I am sure my Conscience would never rest after it, but should think every
Minute I deserv'd Damnation. Foh! A</hi> Jew! <hi>A Stigmatiz'd Rusty-Bacon-look'd
Infidel, that cannot Spit from him! A Black Goggle-Eyed Over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vagabond! Foh, I smell him hither, he stinks in my very Nostrills. If it
were only thro the respect a Body has for ones Religion, sure I'd have chose
a</hi> Christian <hi>for my</hi> Gallant, <hi>tho' he had been a</hi> Porter, <hi>or a</hi> Carman; <hi>and not
have dishonour'd my</hi> Church <hi>so much as to have taken up with an</hi> Antichistian
<hi>Vermin, a very Caterpillar of</hi> Christendom. <hi>I Vow and Protest, if I was in
her Room, I should be afraid the Boat would sink.</hi> Thus did my Mistresses
Zeal to the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> carry her to such a Pitch of Envy, to see
a <hi>Refin'd Protestant</hi> and an <hi>Infidel</hi> in such Charitable Communion with
one another, That I was afraid, in the heighth of her Fury, she would
have leap'd out of the Window, and have separated the Righteous from the
Ungodly; quite forgetting, as <hi>Whores</hi> do, their own Failings, when they
brand another with the same Title; not considering the Honest Design
on foot betwixt her Ladyship and me; looking upon herself all this
while, to be as Justifiable in what we had undertaken, as a <hi>Poor Woman</hi>
that wants Bread, is in Begging a Crust of her Neighbour.</p>
            <p>We had not at the Window spent much time in Prittle-Prattle, but
the Vintner whose Wife was Stragled with the <hi>Iew,</hi> out of the Pale of
the Church, had most Ceremoniously Joyn'd himself with an <hi>Iron-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
Daughter, who in her early Years being Tempted by a <hi>Sea-Captain</hi>
to taste the <hi>Forbiden Fruit,</hi> had unhappily brought herself under the
Suspicion of Incontinence, and quite spoil'd her Market in the business
of Matrimony; that she was grown a pretty stale <hi>Thorn-back,</hi> yet had
Remains enough of her Youthful Perfections to entitle her to the handling
of a Vintner's Apron-Strings: I could not forbear Smiling, at the Odness of
this Accident, when I consider'd what a rare Discovery there would be made
on both sides, if they should Chance to meet in the <hi>Fair;</hi> for it is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to believe, they were absolute Strangers to each others Intrigue;
for sure, thought I, it is Unnatural for a Marry'd Couple, to give one
another the Liberty of <hi>Adultery;</hi> tho' it is very common I believe, for
each other to take it. Since Chance had flung a thing so remarkably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in my Way, I thought my self oblig'd to impart it to my
Mistress, that she might share in the satisfaction of so Uncommon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency;
accordingly I shew'd her the Vintner, telling her he was the
Husband of that Woman who had so highly disoblig'd her, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
her Honour to a <hi>Iew,</hi> and Pinning her Faith upon the Sleeve
of an Infidel; adding, that I knew the Woman that was with him, from
whence I had reason to believe he was upon the like design with his
Companion, as his Wife was with the <hi>Iew? Bless me!</hi> says she, <hi>If my
Husband was like other Men, and shou'd serve me so, I'd study as many ways to
Torment him, as ever a Papist Priest found to Punish a</hi> Heretick, <hi>marry
wou'd I; he should neither Eat, Drink, nor Sleep in any quiet, till I had Plagu'd
his Heart out, before he should run Rambling among strange Women; but as
he is, by my Troth I may venture him, for I can guess by his Performances at
Home, how his Abilities are Abroad.</hi> Which words, were no sooner out
of her Mouth, but in the Crow'd she espied him. <hi>Bless me!</hi> says she,
<hi>Yonder he is with my Neighbour the</hi> Apothecaries <hi>Wife, pressing towards the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94930:5"/>
Stairs, to go into a</hi> Boat: <hi>But I'll spoil their Intrigue, with a Pox to 'em. Stay
you here,</hi> says she, <hi>and I'll be with you again presently:</hi> Down Stairs she ran
in a great Fury, lays hold of the Woman, as she was Descending the
Stairs: <hi>How now Madam,</hi> says she? <hi>Whither are you going with my Husband?
I thought I should Catch you one time or another; I had Intelligence of your
Design last Night, and have been waiting for you in yonder House, this hour or
two.</hi> The Poor Woman, so greatly Surpriz'd with this Discovery, was
ready to sink down under the Hand of her Opponent; but the Husband
thro' a great Presence of Mind, forces his Wife to quit her hold, and bid
the other step into the Boat, ordering the Waterman to go off with her,
and land her where the Gentlewoman directed, holding his Wife fast till
the Boat was adrift; and so at once secur'd her from the Hands of
the Mob, as well as her rash Adversary. Now thought I, I find when
a Woman has a mind to be Lewd, she will not want a Pretence to Justifie
herself in her Liberty; nor could I forbear thinking it was more her
Ungovernable Lust, than her Husbands Impotency, that induc'd her to
be Wicked; for it may be observ'd, the Common Excuses that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
makes to extenuate the Guilt of her Corruption, are either Love,
Necessity, or the Mis-behaviour of their Husbands, either in his Neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he ought to do, or Doing those things, which he ought to
forbear: But while I was thus Ruminating on the Cunning of the Kind
Sex, my Mistress had betaken herself to her <hi>Crocadile Submission;</hi> Crying,
<hi>What had she done, to Occasion such Ill Vsage from him, as to alienate his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
from his Lawful and Loving Wife, and place it upon other Women less
deserving than herself?</hi> These Hypocritical Words, and Dissembling
Tears, so softned the Heart, of the poor disappointed Cuckold, who at
first was so highly displeas'd at her unexpected Discovery, that he had much
ado to forbear striking of her; but she I suppose, well knowing how
to appease his Fury, put on this Counterfeit Behaviour to bring him out
of his Passion, to the Calm Use of his Reason, and Good Nature. The
Fluminous Rabble all this while hollowing the t'other Lady over the
Water, who questionless was as well pleas'd at her safe Deliverance, as
she was Concern'd at first for her Detection. By this time, my Lady
and her Spouse, had withdrawn themselves a little out of the Crow'd,
she Soliciting his Company home, as she inform'd me afterwards, which
she was very Sensible he would not Consent to; But told her <hi>Altho'
she had spoild his Project in one Affair, he'd make himself amends in another;
and since he was a Broad, he'd have his Belly full of Wine before he went Home
again. Do that and Welcome,</hi> says she, <hi>For I would rather find you Ten-times
in a Tavern, than Once in another Womans Company;</hi> and so they
parted. She returning to me, extreamly Delighted with the thoughts
of her Adventure.</p>
            <p>Indeed Madam, <hi>said I,</hi> I wonder you should give your self all this Trouble;
for what's matter, who your Husband keeps Company with, if he be under such
Circumstances as you Report him. Poh, <hi>says she,</hi> you don't know what Policy,
I had in my Head; was it not much better for me to detect them, than to give
them the Opportunity of Detecting us; for I suppose, they were bound to the same
Port: And now I have stop'd their Iourney, the Coast is Clear, and we may Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
our own Vndertaking, with less Fear, and more Safety.</p>
            <p>I could not forbear reflecting in my Thoughts on the Wit, as well
as the Wickedness of Woman, who had no sooner a Conception of the
Danger she herself must have been in, had she suffer'd them to have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94930:6"/>
proceeded in their Voyage, but at the same Instant, projected a method to
remove that stumbling Block out of her Way, which might otherways
have prov'd of fatal Consequence to her own Intrigue. The Goodman,
to be sure, making a kind Construction of her Accidental Discovery; and
thought she had taken all that Pains, on purpose to detect him in his
loose Practices, which he must needs acknowledge, as an argument of her
Love, because she thought him worth her Looking after; and its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
allow'd the greatest Demonstration a Woman can give of her
Love, is her Jealousie; for its a certain Sign we vallue that most, that
we are least willing, and most fearful should be Enjoy'd by another.</p>
            <p>By this time we had an Island of Fish, floating in an Ocean of Butter,
brought up to the Table; of which, like the Lady of a Feast, she Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniously
help'd me to a very plentiful Plate, I gratefully repaid her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with a Cringe, which she return'd with a Bow, that we Nodded at
one another, like two <hi>Rams</hi> in a Challenge, just a going to Butt: Every
Bit that was better than ordinary, she would force upon my Plate, that
no Country <hi>Turky Cock,</hi> fatted against <hi>Christmas</hi> to be sent to my <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord</hi>
at <hi>London,</hi> was ever so Cram'd: I believe, I swallow'd as many boild
<hi>Shrimps,</hi> and fry'd <hi>Oysters,</hi> as an <hi>Estrich</hi> could <hi>Hob-nails</hi> at a Meal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
shoveld down as much <hi>Fresh Cod,</hi> as my <hi>Lord Mayors</hi> Weapon Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
does <hi>Custard</hi> at a Feast; my Lady's chief Diversion all Dinner-time,
being to fish in the Sauce for Delicious Morsels, to feast the Pallate
of her new humble Servant; using so many kind Expressions to Court
me to Eat, that I was quite surfeited with her Sweet Words, before I
had half satisfied my Stomach with our Enticing Dainties; being forc'd
sometimes to be Unmannerly, and Bumpkin like, Court my Mistress to
Eat, with my own Mouth full, for fear she should think by my long
Silence, I did not regard her. When I by the Manly Industry of my Hands
and Jaws, and my Mistress, by her Effeminate Piddling and Picking, had
both satisfied our Appetites, with our Nice and Well-dress'd Dinner,
according to Custom, we thought it necessary to make our Fish Swim
a third time, in a more Noble Element, than either Butter or Water;
calling accordingly for half a Flask of <hi>Red,</hi> that the Noble Tincture of
the Wine, might Enrich our Food of a Purple Colour, and make its
Juice the fitter for our Veins Reception.</p>
            <p>All the Superfluous Implements of Eating being now taken away,
we made each Glass a further Key to unlock the Secrets of our Souls,
and began to Spin out the Threds of Love, to a lasting Length, Wetting
each kind Word with Wine, that the Knot of Friendship might be ty'd
the faster; how far our mutual desires might carry us beyond the Rules
of Modesty, is neither my Business to tell, nor the Readers to enquire
into; for there are many things that are Justifiable in Action, that are
not Decent to Repeat; so that we will make that Modest by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment,
that might be thought Rude in the Discovery.</p>
            <p>When our Flask was out, we thought it high time to begin our
Voyage: In order to set forward, we call'd for our Reckoning, which my
Lady after many Expressions of Apology, for her Rude Unpractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Attempt, but she was Resolutly bound to Defray the Days Expence,
Entreating me to excuse the affront; at which, tho' I seem'd to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied,
yet with much Perswasions, I was at last very heartily reconcil'd
to my Mistress's Prodigallity, and thought I had as much Reason to be
good Humour'd, asif I had Paid it my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94930:6"/>
Having thus pretty well secur'd our Bodies from the Coldness of
the Water, we took Boat at <hi>Billinsgate-stairs,</hi> and away for <hi>Cuckolds-Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but were no sooner put off from the shore, but we were got into such
an Innumerable Fleet, of <hi>Oares, Skullers, Barges, Cock-boats, Bum-boats, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi>
and <hi>Yawles;</hi> some Going, some Coming, and all attacking each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with such Volleys of hard Words, that I thought <hi>Billingsgate-Market</hi>
had been kept upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> and all the <hi>Fish-Whores</hi> in the Town,
had been Scolding for a <hi>Plate,</hi> given 'em by some Rich <hi>Oyster-Woman,</hi>
to encourage the Industry of the Tongue; calling my poor Lady and I,
so often by the Opprobrious Names of <hi>Whore</hi> and <hi>Rogue,</hi> that for my
Part, I thought they were Witches, and had known what we had been
doing; tossing Ladles-full of Water into one anothers Boats, till the Passengers
were many of 'em as wet, as a Turbulent Woman just taken out of the Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Stool.
At last an Unlucky <hi>Rogue,</hi> with <hi>Bridewel</hi>-Looks and a Ladle
in his Hand, fishes up a floating Sir-reverence in his Wooden Vehicle,
and gives it an Unfortunate Toss upon my Ladies Bubbies. She cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to me her Protector, to do the Office of a Scavenger, and take
away the Beastliness, she being herself so very Squeamish, that she could
no more endure to touch it with her Fingers, than a <hi>Monkey</hi> does a <hi>Mouse,</hi>
it being Lodg'd in the Cavity, between her Breasts and her Stays, she
could not shake it off, but I was forc'd to lend a hand to remove the
Poisonous Pellat from her Snowey-Temptations, giving on't a Toss in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Boat, with the like Success, wounding an old Cuckoldy
Waterman just in the Forehead, and so Be-dung'd his <hi>Brow-Antlers,</hi> that
I make no question but they spread and flourish'd, being thus Manur'd
like the Horns of an Ox after well greasing, which put the grisly Churle
(who I'll warrant, by his Grey Haires, had at least serv'd Nine Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice-ships
to the <hi>Thames</hi>) into such a wonderful Passion, that he began
to roar out his Aquatick Scurrility at us, with as much Indignation and
Revenge, as a she-Mumper when bilk'd of her Crib, or an Alley-Scold
when call'd Barren-Bitch, by her Neighbour, clawing the Unsavory Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
off his Face, Snapping on't, as a <hi>Barber</hi> does Suds from the ends of
his Fingers; Saluting my Mistress, and I, in the height of his Fury, after
the following manner. <hi>You Shiten-Skull'd Son of a</hi> T—d, <hi>that has spit
your Brains in my Face, who was Begot in Buggery, Born in a House of
Office, and Deliver'd at the Fundament, fit for nothing but to be Cast into a</hi>
Gold-finders Ditch, <hi>there lie till you're Rotten, and then be sold out to Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
for a hot Bed, to raise Pumkins to feed the Devil withall. And as for
you, You Brandy-Fac'd, Bottle-Nose'd, Bawdy,</hi> Brimstone-Whore, <hi>Every time
you Conjobble together, may he Beget your Belly-full of live</hi> Crabs <hi>and</hi> Craw-Fish,
<hi>that as you strive to pluck 'em out, they may hang by the sides of your</hi> Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoque,
<hi>and make you Squeak nine times lowder than a Woman frighted into
Labour a Month before her Reckoning.</hi> This, and such sort of Water-bred
Language, he pelted at our Ears, till we were out of Hearing: Being both
as glad when we had out-Row'd his Impudence, as a Man that has out-Run
a Bailiff; for if ever any body was under an Ill-Tongue, we thought
our selves at that time in the same condition.</p>
            <p>Every Boat that came by had a pelt at my poor Mistress and I, who being but
Two, besides Water-men, were most lamentably Maul'd by other Boats, who being
better Man'd, were quite too many for us, and rattl'd us into Silence with a Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of <hi>Bilingsgate</hi> Language, which was thrown on all sides so thick upon us, that
we found it but a vain attempt to endeavour to be Heard amidst this Shower of ill-Words.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94930:7"/>
We jog'd gently on, as fast as our Neighbouring Enemies would give us
leave, who lay a <hi>Head</hi> of us, upon our <hi>Bow, Broad-side, Quarters,</hi> and <hi>Stern,</hi> that we
could not turn our Heads any way out of <hi>Tongue-Shot,</hi> but either <hi>Rogue,</hi> or <hi>Whore,
Pimp, Cuckold,</hi> or <hi>Taylor,</hi> hit us a box of the Ear, that almost Deafen'd us. <hi>Dear
Heart,</hi> says my Mistress, <hi>I wonder the Magistrates of the City do not take some care to
prevent these sad Abuses upon the Water; for 'tis a shameful thing that Civil People should
be call'd thus out of their Names.</hi> Prethee, said I, never mind 'em; for if my Lord
M—were here himself, they'd be as ready to call him <hi>Cuckold</hi> as they would any
body else; and he would not know which way to help himself, but must put it up
as we do, there's no remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>After we had spent about half an hour upon the Water in this Misery, we Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at our intended Port, <hi>Cuckolds-Point,</hi> where we Landed in a Crowd, with as
much difficulty as a Man crosses the <hi>Change</hi> at Two a Clock, or squeezes into <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Quire on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> whilst they are Singing of an <hi>Anthem.</hi> Having discharg'd our
Water-men, we went into the House, where the Troop of Merry Cuckolds us'd to
Rendesvouz; Arm'd with <hi>Shovel, Spade,</hi> or <hi>Pick-Ax;</hi> their Heads adorn'd with
Horned Helmets; and from thence to March, in Order, for <hi>Horn-Fair,</hi> Leveling the
Way as they go, according to the Command of their Leaders, that their Wives
might come after with their Gallants, without spoiling their Lac'd Shooes, or drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their Holiday Petticoates. When we had procur'd a Fire to recover our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Warmth, of which the Coldness of the Water had almost Robb'd us, I began to
enquire of the Dame of the Tenement from whence the Custom of the Meeting, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling
and Marching, of this Cornigerous Troop was at first deriv'd? Who told me,
That in the time of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> when Religion could no more keep a Prince's
Codpice Button'd, then it can now infuse Charity in a Priest, <hi>In the room of this, House</hi>
says she, <hi>here then stood a Water-Mill, and Providence having blest the</hi> Knave <hi>the</hi> Miller,
<hi>with a very handsome Wife, King</hi> John <hi>coming often this Way to Hunt upon</hi> Greenwich-Heath,
<hi>&amp; thereabouts, happen'd to see her, and became so Enamour'd with her Lovely Looks, that
he could by no means restrain his Inclinations, but must needs Cuckold the</hi> Miller; <hi>to which, when
an Opportunity stood fair, the Dame Consented; but as 'tis believ'd, so Cunningly manag'd
the matter, that her Husband should come Home, and Catch 'em in the Heighth of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime,
which the</hi> Miller <hi>did accordingly; and seeming not to know that he was King, took him
up in his Arms and Threatn'd to fling him into the Mill-Dam, and Grinil his Head off,
which so frighten'd his Majesty, that he told him if he would spare his Life, he would give
him all the Land as far as he could see one Way. Which the</hi> Miller <hi>made him Vow to
perform, before he would quit his hold; but then set him down very Civilly, and went
into his Mill,</hi> Leaving the King to finish his Business with his Wife, as a means to
further Engage him to the Performance of his Promise; the Miller waiting with a
great deal of Impatience, till his Wife had submitted herself, like a Good Subject, to
her dread Soveraign, and quietly surrender'd that Fort, upon Discretion, which the
King greatly wanted to be Master of: But as soon as the Fatigue was over, and
the Royal Cuckold-Maker had gratified his ambition in adorning the Brows of the
Mealy Peasant, the Miller began to Solicite his Imperial Rival for the generous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he had promised, to facillitate the wearing of that Forked Burthen, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
would have sat very uneasily on his Fore-head. The King assur'd him he would
be as Good as his Word, and bid him look out, and the Land, as far as he could see one
Way, on that side the River, he should possess as his own, Paying only this anuual
acknowledgment, That he should once a Year, upon that day Twelve-month, which
prov'd the 18th of <hi>October,</hi> Walk to the farthest bound of his Estate, with a Pair of
<hi>Bucks</hi>-Horns on his Head, attended with all his Family; or in Neglect of which, the
Land should be forefeited; to which the Miller had Cunning enough to very readily
Consent. The Cuckold-maker and the Cuckold being thus agreed, he was about to turn
and look up towards <hi>London;</hi> which the King forbad him, telling him he had nothing
that Way in his Power to dispose of, but order'd him to look downwards, and as
far as he could see that Way, should be given him. The Miller having Wash'd his
Eyes in Maids Water, to make him Clear Sighted, according to the Kings Order,
look'd downwards, and saw as far as <hi>Charlton-Hill,</hi> all which Land between that and
the Point, he afterwards Enjoy'd, only performing the aforementioned Ceremony, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Agreement: <hi>Whish,</hi> says she, <hi>was the Original of this Custom, and it is said
that there are Lands hereabout, that are held even to this Day after the same manner.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94930:7"/>
With this piece of History we were mightily pleas'd, the Woman herself show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great deal of Zeal in the belief of the same; which indeed I swallow'd without
Chewing, as the Mob does the Political Reports of State, or an Ignorant Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
does the Hum-Drum Doctrine of a Dark Priest.</p>
            <p>When we had Warm'd and refresh'd our Chill'd Carcasses, we set forward for <hi>Dept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
and having heard great Commendation of that Serviceable Projection, the <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w-Dock,</hi>
I had a great desire to take a View of that by the Way, and so Shap'd my
Course accordingly. After we had pass'd by a long Range of little Cottages, at the
Doors of which sat abundance of <hi>Dutch-Buttock'd</hi> Lasses, with Sea Handkerchiefs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their Pouting Bubbies, which were swell'd with much handling, so far beyond
their Natural Proportion, that their Breast and their Bellies, like Mother <hi>Shipton's</hi>
Nose and Chin, met one with the other; some Knitting, some Spinning, and others
picking <hi>Okum;</hi> but all, as I suppose, ready enough to quit their several Exercises and
betake themselves to a Pleasanter Pastime, if any Body will hire 'em. Having past
by a great Number of these Condescending Mortals, we came to a Field which led
to the Entrance of the <hi>Dock,</hi> about a Stones Cast on this side which, were a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>West-Indian-Creolians,</hi> lately come on Shore, Cooking in the open Air, an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Porker after the <hi>Indian</hi> manner, which was attempted to be perform'd as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
They drove Sticks in the Ground, and Fenc'd in a square place with Old
<hi>Tarpaulins,</hi> leaving one side open for the Wind to Fan the Fire which was made in
the middle with <hi>Charcole,</hi> directly over which lay the Grunter on a <hi>Grid-Iron,</hi>
made of Spits; which were laid Cross, from side to side; the part that lay uppermost,
being cover'd with the Dripping-Pan, to preserve it from Cooling, and the Fat drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Fire, cast up such savoury Fumes from the burning Grease, that the Nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of foul Candlesticks thrust into a Kitchen-Fire by a Good House-Wife of a
Cook, could not perfume her Sluttish-ships Territories with a more Obliging Odor;
and about Six or Eight foot distance, from the main-Fire, was another Fire, to
the Windward of the Pig, most Cunningly Contriv'd to Warm the Air, as it pass'd,
lest its Coldness otherways might be some Impediment to the Grilliading, or beastly
Cooking of their III favour'd Beast, whose Eyes were Roasted in his Head according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Negroes</hi> Cookery, that he star'd like a Dead Pig; and that side that lay next
to the Fire, with the Smoak of the Driping was almost as black as the <hi>Charcole</hi> beneath
it; that I question not but by the Time it was Ready, it stunk like a piece of <hi>Cheshire-Cheese,</hi>
Toa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted in the Flame of a Candle, and look'd all over as black as the Rind
of a Flitch of <hi>Bacon,</hi> that has hung Six months in a Country Chimney.</p>
            <p>We left them as busie about their Savage Piece of Cookery, as so many chosen
Housewives dressing of a Weding Dinner, and went into the Yard appertaining to
the Dock, reported by Competent Judges to be able to receive 200 sail of Large
Ships; which Serviceable Project, has so highly Disoblig'd the King of the <hi>East,</hi>
that he had Vow'd <hi>Cuckoldome</hi> to the whole Parish of <hi>Deptford,</hi> which of late has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
every <hi>Marriner</hi> and <hi>Ship-Carpenter</hi> adjacent, that has a handsome Wife, to
look as narrowly after her, as a Hen does after her Chickens, to preserve 'em from
the <hi>Kite.</hi> When we came about the middle of the Dock, we were oblig'd either to
return back and go a Mile about, or else cross the Top of the Flood-gates, at the
Mouth of the Dock, which were about the common breadth of a Deal Board, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Ten Yards over. My Mistress was much more ready to be at the Pains, than
choose the danger; Remembring, <hi>That the furthest way About, might be the nearest way
Home;</hi> and I was for running the hazard, to avoid the Pains, and endeavour'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
on my Lady to take Courage, and run the risque of being Duck'd, to Abridge
our Journey; with much ado, by upbraiding her with Cowardice, and giving her some
Words of Encouragement, I at last chas'd away her Effeminacy, and made her resolve
to endanger the Cooling of her <hi>Leachery,</hi> to oblige her Gallant; which she undertook and
perform'd with so much Bravery, that had the Stoutest Stallion in Christendom been
on the other side, to have receiv'd her, she could not have run thro' the danger
with a more Undaunted Resolution; but I found by her Countenance, she was as well
pleas'd when she had got safe over, as a Countrey Fellow that has Shot the <hi>Bridge,</hi> or
a Town Bully that had surviv'd a <hi>Duel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we proceeded till we came to <hi>Deptford,</hi> where I think the first House
in the Town, like many others, is accounted a Conveniency for his Majesties <hi>Water-Rats,</hi>
when residing upon Land, to Cool their Tails in; when we came a little further
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94930:8"/>
into the Town, we might easily discern, by the built of the Houses, what <hi>Amphibeous</hi> sort
of Creatures chiefly Inhabited this part of the Kingdom; their Dens were chiefly Wood,
all of one form, as if they were oblig'd by Act of Parliament, to all Build after the
same Model; here a pretty Woman or two at a Door, there another o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> two at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
all looking as Melancholy as Old Maids and Widows, for want of Male Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
gazing upon each Man that pass'd 'em, with as much Earnestness and
Desire, as ever our Great Grand-Mother did upon the Forbidden Fruit. The Ladies
that chiefly Inhabit these Cabbins, were the Wives of <hi>Marriners,</hi> whose Husbands were
some gone to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and some to the <hi>West,</hi> some <hi>Northward,</hi> some <hi>Southward,</hi>
leaving their Disconsolate Spouses, to make Tryal of their Vertue, and live upon Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Credit till their return, who if it were not for the Benevolence of a well-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Neighbouring Knight, and a few more Charitable Worthy Gentlemen, they
might, tho' Married, grow Sullen, like the <hi>Negro</hi> Women, for want of Husbands, and
pine away because Nature is not supply'd with due Accommodation. Many Shops
we observ'd open in the Streets, but a Brandy-Bottle, and a Quartern, a Butcher men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a Canvas Doublet, a few Apples in a Cabbage-Net, a Peel-full of <hi>Deptford</hi>
Cheescakes, an old Waste-Coat, a Thrum Cap, and a pair of Yarn Mittings, were
the chief Shows that they made of their Commodities, every House being distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
by either the Sign of the <hi>Ship,</hi> the <hi>Anchor,</hi> the <hi>Three Marriners, Boatswain,</hi>
and <hi>Call,</hi> or something relating to the Sea: For as I suppose, if they should hang up any
other, the <hi>Salt-water Novices</hi> would be as much puzled to know what the Figure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
as the <hi>Irish-man</hi> was, when he call'd the <hi>Globe</hi> the Golden <hi>Case-body,</hi> and the
<hi>Vnicorn</hi> the <hi>White-horse</hi> with a <hi>Barbers</hi> Pole in his Forehead.</p>
            <p>The Women we chiefly met in the Streets, were Accouter'd most commonly like
the meanest of our <hi>Oyster-women,</hi> in Ragged <hi>Gowns,</hi> Daggled <hi>Petty-Coats,</hi> Blew <hi>Aprons,</hi>
Speckled <hi>Handkerchiefs</hi> about their Necks, and their Heads adorn'd with <hi>Flat-Caps;</hi>
those that we met Coupled, had generally short squat well-tr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss'd-Fellows by their
Sides, in New course <hi>Cloth-Coats,</hi> Speckled <hi>Breeches,</hi> Grey <hi>Stockins,</hi> Round-Toe'd
<hi>Shooes,</hi> Picked Heels, stitch'd round the Quarters, ty'd on with <hi>Scarlet-Tape</hi> instead
of Buckles, with Mittings on his Hands, a <hi>Fur-Cap</hi> on his Head, Arm'd with an
Oaken Cudgel, with a Head as big as a four Pounder. I observ'd they all, <hi>Spaniard</hi>
like, kept up to one Fashion, so that the same Description would serve any I saw,
with a very Slender Variation. Now and then, 'tis true, we met a Bluff Blade, who
look'd as Burly as if he had Fed his whole Life-time upon Peas and Swines Flesh, with
a Campaign Wig on, the Haires of which, for want of Combing once in a Month,
hung in as many Tangle Locks, as if he had been flying, and a Sword ty'd on as high
as the Waste-band of his Breeches, and had no more motion when he walk'd, than a
Two-foot Rule, stuck into the Apron-Strings of a <hi>Carpenter:</hi> These sort of Sea Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
I observ'd the <hi>Mumpers</hi> saluted with the Title of <hi>Noble Captain,</hi> and had the
right Knack of Coaxing these Quarter-Deck-<hi>Blunderbusses</hi> out of their Farthings
and Half-pence, with the taking and insinuating Cant of Honour and Worship, as
fast as a Horse <hi>Mountebank</hi> Gulls the Mob out of their Two-pences, by calling of
them Gentlemen; his Noble Worship looking round him as big, after he had paid
the <hi>Beggar</hi> a Penny for his Title, as an old Cozening <hi>Curmudgeon,</hi> who has Built an
<hi>Alms-house,</hi> or a Rich Citizen that has got a poor Brothers Child into the <hi>Blew-Coat-Hospital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We walk'd on till we came to the upper End of the Town, where stood some very
pretty Houses, whose Gates for Ostentation-sake, were made with Bars, that each
Passenger might Delight his Eyes, with an External Prospect of these their most
Creditable and Beautiful Habitations: In this Row stood a most famous <hi>Hospital,</hi>
Erected for the Entertainment of Thirty-one Decay'd Masters of Vessels, or their
Widows, depending on the <hi>Trinity-House;</hi> the Masters of which, having the Care
thereof; to the relief and support of which Charitable Design, every Ship at her
Clearing, pays according to her Burthen so much Money. Our Curiosity led us to
take a Turn into it, which we found very Pleasant and Commodious, as to the
Building and Situation; but when I enquir'd into the Allowance, I found it so very
small, that it might rather be call'd <hi>Pinch-Gut-Colledge,</hi> than an <hi>Hospital</hi> for Poor
Pensioners; who with much difficulty gaining Admittance into these Starving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,
have no more allow'd 'em, to find <hi>Meat, Drink, Washing, Fire, Cloths,</hi> and all
Necessaries of Life, than Twelve Shillings <hi>per Month;</hi> and four Months in the Year
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94930:8"/>
are set at five Weeks, to take in the Odd Month; most that are there having Paid
more Money towards it, before they came into it, than ever their Allowance would
amount to, if they were to Live Fifty Years in the <hi>Hospital;</hi> to which many great Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
have been left, but the Number of Pensioners never Encreas'd, nor their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
Advanc'd; so that how it is sunk, or lmbezell'd, or to what Use Converted,
no Body knows, but those Persons who have the Discretionary Power, as 'tis suppos'd,
of laying it safe up in their own Pockets. An <hi>East-India</hi> Captain, some few Years
since, Dying, Bequeath'd Thirteen Hundred Pounds to this <hi>Hospital;</hi> out of which
Money, it never Receiv'd any other apparent Advantage, than the Statue of the
Benefactor set up in the Garden, for the Pensioners to Feast their Eyes, instead of their
Bellies, withal. The Members of this Society of <hi>Tarpaulin Paupers,</hi> are only during
the Pleasure of the Masters of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and are liable to be turn'd out, upon
very slender Mis-behaviours. There is another such <hi>Hospital</hi> by the Church, Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Founded by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for but Twenty-one Poor Masters, or their
Widows; and except in Number, is equal in every particular, with the former;
so that by all the Observations I could make, in so short a Passage thro' the
Town, I could not but think it very well deserv'd this following Character: The
Town's without <hi>Necessaries;</hi> they've Butchers without <hi>Meat,</hi> Ale-houses without <hi>Drink,</hi>
Houses without <hi>Furniture,</hi> and Shops without <hi>Trade;</hi> Captains without <hi>Commission,</hi>
Wives without <hi>Husbands,</hi> Whores without <hi>Smocks,</hi> a Church without <hi>Religion,</hi> and
Hospitals without <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence we made the best of our Way, towards <hi>Greenwich,</hi> finding nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
by the Way, but now and then, a Knot of <hi>London Prentices,</hi> Arm'd with Lad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
of Defence, to secure their Noddles and their Elbows, from the Insolent Assaults of
the more Unlucky Mob, drawn out of <hi>Spittle-Fields, Clare-Market, and Sweet St. Giles;</hi>
in which parts of the Town, Rude Rogues and Reprobates are as Plenty as Lice
in a Campaign, or Flies in <hi>Iuly</hi> in the Shop of a Confectioner. The first part of
<hi>Greenwich</hi> Town that I came into was the <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> where the Numbers of the
Dead, had almost Bury'd the Church, that could each Corps Buried against the
Church Wall, raise his Head but half a Foot above the Surface of the Earth he
lies in, he might peep in at the Church Window, on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> and frighten the
whole Congregation out of the Church. As I Enter'd the Holy Ground, I took
Notice of several Good Houses on the Left Hand, which look'd like Habitations fit
for Christians to Live in; but in some parts of the Town, the Huts were no bigger than
<hi>Indian Wig-wams,</hi> scarce big enough for a <hi>Cuckold</hi> and his Wife, to lye at length,
without puting their Head or their Heeles in the Chimney Corner. Hearing the
Kings House being Converted to an <hi>Hospital,</hi> for Disabled Seamen, as a means to
Encourage others hereafter to venture their Limbs in the Nations-Service, to be
rewarded with a Lazy Life, no Money, and short Commons, when either Age or
Lameness has made them a Misery to themselves, and a Burthen to the World; we
took a Walk into it, to take a Brief Survey of this New and Well-intended piece of
Charity; which like the gay Buildings of <hi>Northampton,</hi> looks very Stately and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
without side, but Examine within, and you'll find but very poor Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
one part of it was almost finished, wherein I observ'd every Pensioner
was design'd a distinct Cabbin to himself, and was alloted a little more room than
he is like to Enjoy in the Church-Yard, and not much neither: When it's all
Compleated, 'twill be a Noble Edifice, not at all Inferiour to any of those great
Gifts, where much more Grandure is Visible in the Walls, than Hospitallity in the
Kitchen; but its Situate in a good Place for a little Victuals to make a great show;
for <hi>Greenwich,</hi> like a Spanish Town, is under such a Scarcity of Flesh Meat, that
a Gentleman not long ago, brought his Mistress down with a Design to lye all
Night in the Town, but was forc'd to go back to <hi>London,</hi> at seven a Clock at
Night, against Tide, because never a Publick House in the Town could procure
him a Supper. It's a rare place to Punish a Man troubled with a <hi>Caninus Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titus,</hi>
for a Walk in the <hi>Park</hi> is a rare thing to put his Stomach in an uproar, and
the Town an excellent place to make him run Mad for want of Victuals to allay
his Hunger: Here many Citizens in the Summer time keep their Wives at Board-Wages,
purely because there's no manner of Dainties to incline them to Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance:
here many of 'em also put their Children to Nurse, because it's a sharp Air,
and fit for the Breeding up a Young shop-keeper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94930:9"/>
From thence we walk'd on till we came upon the Heath; but Climbing up the
Hill, we saw at the bottom of a deep Precipice, the Mouth of several Caves, <hi>Pray,
Sir,</hi> said my Mistress, <hi>What Vgly Frightful Places are those at the bottom of the Pit?
Indeed Madam,</hi> said I, <hi>I cann't well tell; but they took as if they were the Back Doors to the
Devils Territories, and that the People of</hi> Greenwich <hi>had found out a nearer Cut to
Hell, than the rest of their Neighbours.</hi> We were no sooner come upon the Heath,
but every <hi>Fool</hi> was become a <hi>Tom-Ladle;</hi> and every Bush was made a Fence to a
<hi>Furmity Kettle,</hi> the Gentlemen Quick-workers in the dark Mystery of Mischief,
were here assembled in a body, in order to break the Elbows of all <hi>Nonconformists,</hi>
that would not come over to the Ladle-Discipline; which my Mistress and I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
were forc'd to Conform to the Custom of the Countrey, and each Arm
our selves with a Ladle, as a Protection from the Rabbles Insolence; who indeed,
were afterwards as Civil to us as could be expected of such Tameless Monsters; and
let us pass with now and then a little Knock of the Elbow, not much harder than
would have Crack'd a Fill-bert; which we were forc'd to bear, with all Patience
and Submission, till we came into the Fair, of which I shall proceed to give
you a True Character.</p>
            <p>It stands near the <hi>Church,</hi> to make good the Old Proverb, <hi>viz. The nearer the
Church, the farther from God.</hi> Tho' it's the Rudest Fair in <hi>England,</hi> it begins with
a Sermon; which makes another Old saying Good, <hi>viz. In the Name of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
all Mischief.</hi> They say the Parson usually takes his Text upon this Occasion
out of <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs; and I asking why he did so, was told, <hi>Because</hi> Solomon
<hi>was a great Cuckold-maker, and therefore his Doctrine was the fitter to be prench'd at</hi>
Horn-Fair. The People of the Town eat so sparingly, that they never Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
but once a week, and that's on Sundays, making the Church-Yard their
Dunghill, which you cannot cross without wading up to your Ancles in Sir-reverence.
All that is Sold at the Fair of use, are Shooes, Pattins, and Leather-Breeches;
the rest are Horn-Toys, and Fools-Baubles? The one bought to vex Cuckolds,
and the other to please Children. The whole place, for the time, is a Common-Wealth,
where the <hi>Rabble</hi> make Laws, and all that approach must keep 'em.
It's an Ill place for a Proud Man to walk with his Arms on Kimbo, for they
have more spight against the Elbows than any part of the Body. He that
brings Money to this Fair, must look after his Pockets; for the <hi>Waterlane</hi>-Anglers
are here as busie as <hi>Milk-Maids</hi> on a <hi>May-day.</hi> It is an Annual Rendesvouz for
the Mob of <hi>London,</hi> where it is as rare to see Persons of Creditable appearance,
as 'tis to see an Honest man in <hi>Newgate,</hi> or a Fool in the Jews <hi>Synogogue.</hi> Here
is a great deal of Furmity to be Sold, but very few People that buy any. Here
are a great many Thieves, but few that have any thing to Lose; and abundance
of Beggars, but few or none to relieve 'em. The Fair seems to stand
bounded between God and the Devil; for the Church stands at one end of it,
and a Musick-house at t'other. It's good for nothing, as I know on, but to humble
the Conceit that a Proud Man may have of his Person; for it's enough to make
a Man out of Love with Humane Shape, to behold the Folly and Rudeness of
so many Reprobates, that were at it. 'Tis a Sanctuary for Ill Manners, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of all Rudeness, an Encouragement of Wickedness, a Revelling of young
Libertines, a Looking-glass of Confusion, hurtful to good Manners, and hateful
to all Good Men.</p>
