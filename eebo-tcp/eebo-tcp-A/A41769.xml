         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>
a tragical exaggeration of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
amongst Protestants, serves
constantly to fill up many Pages
in their Writings: and is the
principal subject of their Popular
Declamations, where they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to vent them. And they
have told this Tale so often, that
many of them, especially those of
the common sort, seem to believe it.
<hi>Verùm ad Populum phaleras.</hi>
Those who are wise amongst them,
cannot but know the vanity and
falshood of this pretence. It hath
been already demonstrated, and may
be again if need require, that there
is not one point in which they differ
from Protestants, wherein they are
agreed among themselves. However
it cannot be denyed, but that they
industriously improve all imaginable


<pb facs="tcp:34806:4"/>
artifices to conceal, at least to give
a colourable pretence unto their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine
wranglings and debates: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herein, as to their design, wiser
than the children of Light; though
the means, whereby they pursue it,
are remote enough both from wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and honesty. Where different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and contradictory Assertions
have already been vented, and have
firmed their station in the Writings
of the Doctors of their Church;
(as multitudes have done, and that
in and about Articles of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;)
they are ready with
their Plea, that these differences,
as managed by their Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
are not of Faith, or do not
impugn it, which way soever they
are determined. As though the
Faith of their Church were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of gross contradictions, in and
about the principal Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
and those, some of them,


<pb facs="tcp:34806:5"/>
such, as that for Opinions of less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
they are ready to brand
others for Hereticks, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
their extirpation from the
face of the earth. This is the whole
of what can be pretended for what
is past; and therefore remediless.
How destitute of truth and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
their plea herein is, hath been
declared by many. If any single
Person, or lesser number of Men
among them, begin at any time to
apprehend and divulge sentiments
different from what is generally
received, (unless it be to make some
advance in the furtherance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of their own Secular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and advantages; as all the late
inventions and bold attempts of the
<hi>Jesuits,</hi> both in their Mystical and
Moral Divinity, openly and plainly
do;) they have wayes in readiness
to cast them and their Opinions out
of all notice and consideration;


<pb facs="tcp:34806:5"/>
where they must lye untill the Earth
give up its dead, and disclose the
bloud that is secretly poured into
its womb. They seem indeed, at
present, signally resolved to obviate
all progression in Opinions, true or
false, unless they have a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to the establishment, or adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Papal Omnipotency, and
the increase of their own Interest
in the Consciences, and over the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
concerns of men. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are they so blindly zealous, as
to endeavour, at this day, to fix
and gild the Weather-Cock of Papal
Personal Infallibility, yea, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, on the top of that
Tower, the visible rottenness of whose
Foundations threatens them with a
downfall every moment. Some of
their present differences, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
they know, are fixed beyond
all possibility of reconciliation, or
hopes of removal. Such are those


<pb facs="tcp:34806:6"/>
contradictory Opinions, which are
the inseparable adjuncts of some of
their Religious Orders: which as they
more and more discover themselves
to be irreconcileable, so the relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment
of any of them by their
respective Assertors, is so remote
from all expectation, that an Age
scarce produceth an Instance of any
one individual Person, renouncing
the Opinions of his own, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
those of another Order; and
if any such should be found, he
would be looked upon as a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
if not an Apostate. The sense,
I confess, of these differences seems
to be taken from them by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness
and certainty. It passes
for granted amongst them, that in
some things, wherein both sides
esteem Religion deeply concerned,
the <hi>Jesuits</hi> must be of one Opinion,
and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> must be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
so must it be, in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,


<pb facs="tcp:34806:6"/>
between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and
<hi>Franciscans;</hi> the <hi>Hildebrandine
Jesuits</hi> and the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> also.
They must believe contradictory as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
and propositions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and write and preach contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
and confute the Opinions
of one another: and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
endlesly pursue mutual feuds
and quarrels among themselves; and
yet they are all at perfect agreement.
But the relief herein is, that these
Orders being confirmed and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
all of them, by the Pope, let
them differ and contend whilst they
please, so they fall not into excesses
evidently beyond the tedder of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
strifes, their contentions are to
pass for agreements, and a part of
that unity of Faith, which they
boast in. But yet notwithstanding
all palliating pretences, and the use
of their utmost diligence, their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
sometimes arise to such an

state of all things in the places where
the Controversies are agitated; and
the Opinions themselves, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
they endeavour; that the
determination of the points in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
according to their desire, is


<pb facs="tcp:34806:7"/>
not only suitable unto, and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
with the present Interest of the
See and Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> but lyes
also in a handsome tendency to the
enlargement of its Authority and
Reputation; little or no danger
being to be feared from the dis-satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
of the Adverse Party. These
are the things, which, upon any
such address, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
doth heedfully and scrupulously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into. Nor will it engage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a decision of any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
points, untill it hath received
full and ample satisfaction, that the
determination of them hath an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
consistency with its honour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and advantage. Vntill it
can come to a Resolution herein, a
thousand tergiversations, delayes,
pretences of avocation, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
by more important occasions,
difficulties about the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
shall be pretended and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.


<pb facs="tcp:34806:8"/>
In the mean time, by their
Agents, Nuncioes, Emissaries and
Confidents of all sorts abroad, they
of the Court endeavour to sound
the minds of the great and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
where the Controversies are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged;
and to take a just measure
of the Interests of the several
Parties, engaged in the contest
depending before his Holiness. If
upon search, inquiry and mature
deliberation, it appears, that there
is any thing looking towards a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
between the Parties litigant;
the managers of the Politicks of
the <hi>Roman</hi> See proceed as warily,
as if they feared a Scorpion under
every stone in their way; or should
tread on deceitful ashes, that might
burn, if not consume them. For
the most part, in such cases, his
Holiness would be glad, on any
terms, to be freed from making a
decision: and is oftentimes more


<pb facs="tcp:34806:8"/>
than half angry with those, whom
he most favours, that they should
bring him into any straits, by their
importunity to have an interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of his Authority on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
But yet it may be things
come at last to that pass, that a
continued suspence, or absolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
to determine any thing, is
judged to be more noxious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
than a determination against
the Interest of that Party, which the
Court is fully satisfied to be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
though at present some way
considerable. In this case a decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall be made; not direct, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
or absolute, in terms and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
affirming or denying, with
respect unto the controverted Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:

But this I am apt to think; that
strong delusion doth assuredly possess
the minds of those, who can believe,
that such lyes have any footstep or
foundation in the Religion of Jesus
Christ. And herein consists that
great means of agreement amongst
themselves, whereof they boast:
which how long it will yield them
relief in that kind, God only knows:
its foundation being in the sin and
blindness of the world, its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
may be long, for ought I
know. Now, Reader, that thou maist
not suspect thy self imposed on, or
any thing in the preceding Discourse
to be asserted either partially, or
without due evidence of Truth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
here an Instance in the ensuing
Treatise, wherein not only everything,
that I have declared, is exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the full; but also sundry other
ffects of the old mysterious Iniquity


<pb facs="tcp:34806:12"/>
the <hi>Roman See</hi> are plainly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
This is the Instance of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senisme;</hi>
the Rice, Progress, State
and condition whereof the ensuing
Treatise giveth an Historical account.
There are very few, I suppose, amongst
us, who so little concern themselves
in Religion, especially when it once
comes to bear a share in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and political transactions of the
Nations of the world, who have not
taken notice of the discourses and
reports concerning <hi>Jansenisme</hi> from
the Neighbour Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
To some, it may be, it is a murmur,
which they know not well what to
make of, nor what is intended by
it. Others, in general, conceive it
to be an expression of some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in Religion: but of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
importance or tendency; how
or by whom agitated or maintained,
they know not. But whereas it
comes under a double consideration,


<pb facs="tcp:34806:12"/>
there are two sorts of Persons, who
judge themselves concerned to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an acquaintance with it. For
it is not only considerable as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
in Religion; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
contemplative persons, or men
of Learning, professing the Truth of
the Gospel, esteem themselves obliged
to inquire into it to the utmost:
but also as it hath an influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Civil affairs of that Kingdom,
and may have so into those of the
whole Papal World; in which respect
men that are, or should be Politically
wise and Counsellors do suppose, that
the knowledge of the true state of it
is not to be neglected by them. But
certain it is, that hitherto neither
of these sorts could, in any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
measure, attain their ends,
without such an expence of time,
pains and diligence, as very few
have either will, leisure or ability
to be at. For as the Theological

their inquest, by the ensuing Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
narration; as well as others,
who had hitherto but a slender and
uncertain report of this matter, will
find themselves brought out into the
clear light of such an apprehension
of it, as to have in readiness a just
<hi>measure</hi> of those future reports or
Discourses concerning it, that they
may meet withal. Now whereas
any long account of the matter, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of in this place, would but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Reader in what he will
meet withal in the Discourse it self;
I shall only add some such remarks
upon the whole, as may manifest,
what hath been before discoursed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the unity of Doctrine in the
Papal Church, and their Artifices to
preserve a pretence thereof, to be
exactly exemplified in this one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>Jansenisme.</hi> The System
of Doctrines concerning the Grace
of God, and the wills of men, which


<pb facs="tcp:34806:14"/>
now goes under the name of <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi>
as it is in general agreeabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
unto the Scripture; so it had firmed
it self in the common profession o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Christians, by the Writings of some
excellent persons, especially <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi>
and those who followed him,
unto such a general acceptation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as that the belief and profession of
it could never be utterly rooted out
from the minds of men in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church it self. For although it
was variously depraved, vitiated,
obscured and opposed in and by the
Writings of many of the School-Men;
yet alwayes, in every Age, some or
other Persons of signal Learning
and ability stood up, and pleaded
for its vindication and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as to the substance of it.
Amongst whom our Renowned <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardine,</hi>
who with singular dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and scholastick ability opposed
the spreading of <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> in and


<pb facs="tcp:34806:14"/>
over the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, (which by
various degrees had been, for a long
season, insinuating it self thereinto,
and insensibly invading the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vitals of its Doctrine;) deserves
on all occasions a peculiar menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Moreover, one whole Order of
their Fryers, out of zeal for the
Doctrine of <hi>Thomas,</hi> (who was
less averse from the Sentiments of
the Antients in this matter, than
the most of that litigious crew of
Disputers, whom they call School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;)
did retain some of the most
material Principles of this Doctrine,
however not a little vitiated with
various intermixtures of their own.
Not a full Age since, as will appear
in the ensuing account, after the
lesser attempts of some more private
persons, <hi>Jansenius,</hi> a Bishop in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
undertakes the explication
and the vindication of the whole
Doctrine of the Effectual Grace of

also three Books containing the bodie of

wherein he was incomparably verst: For,
as 'tis said, he read over the whole of
<hi>Austin</hi> ten times, and his <hi>Books of Grace</hi>
thirty times. And indeed his design
seems to be no other than that of <hi>Austin,</hi>
for the <hi>depressing of Corrupt Nature,</hi> and
<hi>advancing</hi> of <hi>efficacious Grace:</hi> whence
he stiles his Book <hi>Augustinus;</hi> which he

perhaps they would not have thought
fit so to do; but after he set upon and
outraged them as he did, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that they have endeavored to be
revenged on him. He continued to
exaggerate to me the exorbitances of
that Author, who not only fell foul
upon the Societie, but even broke forth
against Popes; as among other places
of his Book, that shews it, where he

That the Authors of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions

for examination of the Grand
Questions concerning Grace, we thought
fit, before all things, to compose two
Writings, which we present to your
Holines; one whereof contains what
hath passed in the affair under debate,
and the other concerneth St. <hi>Austins</hi>

Autoritie—Soon after St. <hi>Austin's</hi>
death, some Priests of <hi>France</hi> found fault
with his writings, and troubled the
Peace of the Church, by indiscreet
Questions; whereupon <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie</hi>
had recourse unto <hi>Celestin</hi>—Who
ordained that the <hi>Autoritie</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of <hi>Austin,</hi> should remain invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.
<hi>Molina</hi> having had the boldnes
in <hi>Spain,</hi> to renew these ancient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
made of the Priests of <hi>France,</hi>
and once again to make head against

being accused to the <hi>Holy See,</hi> in
which <hi>Clement</hi> 8. presided at that time,
this holy Pope would not have the
cause examined before him, till he had
first ordained, that the <hi>Autoritie</hi> of
S. <hi>Austin</hi> should be approved—The like
did Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 5th afterwards. Yet
there are found at this day New <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>

to defend <hi>Molina's</hi> Doctrine, have had
the <hi>Presumption</hi> to rise anew against

of the confidence and friendship,
wherewith you are pleased to honor

your going too far therein: for I can
make no other construction of your
too favorable judgement of me, than
that it proceeds from a singular <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>


                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:34806:38"/>
which gives you an <hi>opinion</hi> of me,
far above what I acknowledge in my<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>self.
I have alwayes written unto you
in <hi>sinceritie;</hi> and freely signified unto
you my <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>sentiments</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your <hi>journey</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> about
the <hi>Affairs</hi> which you manage there,
and concerning the <hi>proposals,</hi> which
you have made to me. And because I
see things not altered, or at least varied
only in appearance, and some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
I cannot change my <hi>judgement</hi>
or <hi>disposition.</hi> 'Tis true, what you tell
me, that <hi>Residence</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
in regard of the <hi>corruption of the
mind,</hi> which oftentimes carries its poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
into the bottom of the <hi>heart,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being taken notice of, insensibly
corrupting <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> it self, by
human <hi>prudence,</hi> and a manner of life
and deportment altogether <hi>Political,</hi>
which people contract there, unles they
be prevented, by Gods special <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>favor.</hi> And to tell you the <hi>truth,</hi>
though I am much averse from that
<hi>vice,</hi> which passes for <hi>virtue</hi> in the
world, yet I account not my self so
strong, but that I think fit to avoid


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34806:38"/>
even the occasions of it. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
'tis not this alone, which keeps
me from coming to you, and taking
upon me that part, which you would
assign me, in the Affairs, wherein you
are engaged. If I conceived I could be
as serviceable therein as you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
and could it reasonably be hoped,
matters would be so carried, and have
such <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Issues</hi> as you aim at, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
should no longer detain me, nor
the danger of the waies, and <hi>Residence</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> keep me from offering my

second you in that, which you indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
to performe to him. But I am
so strongly persuaded of the contrary,
both by potent consideration taken
from <hi>human Prudence,</hi> as well as from
<hi>Reasons Divine,</hi> and founded upon the
present <hi>posture</hi> of things, that all the
<hi>Remonstrances</hi> in your Letter, have not
moved me; although otherwise I may
say (I think) without flatterie, that
I am so devoted to satisfie my friends,
as far as my ability reacheth, that I
can scarce deny any thing unto them,
without doing violence to my self;
especially in things wherein the service

sufficiently <hi>impartial</hi> to determine them</q>
(which is very difficult, not to say moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible) <q>I could not promise to
my self, the succes, you aim at, and
seem to hold for certain. All that
could be hoped, so far as I see, from
such a conference, and most upright
Judges, is, that things would remain as
they are. Should the <hi>Arbitrators</hi>
be disposed to do some thing more,
and to pronounce in favor of <hi>Truth;</hi>
they who have been inveigled into
the contrary part, the <hi>Temporal Powers</hi>
ingaged with them, and the <hi>Spiritual</hi>
would quite stop the passing of such
judgement, thereby to avoid offending
many of the world; and, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of eschewing <hi>division,</hi> leave things
as they are. If you judge my <hi>conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi>
and the <hi>consequences</hi> I draw from
them disagreeing from your own


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34806:39"/>
thoughts, yet I am confident you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but say, that the <hi>suppositions</hi>
which I make, and from whence I
draw these <hi>consequences,</hi> are very <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable.</hi>
For leaving you to find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
capable to <hi>propose,</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi>
the <hi>Truth</hi> befittingly in a <hi>regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi>
I think you will not be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to confes, that there is not the
least likelihood of finding <hi>Iudges</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<hi>intelligent,</hi> in these matters; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
well affected to <hi>truth,</hi> and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
armed, against all sorts of <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,</hi>
to <hi>pronounce</hi> in its <hi>favor,</hi> when
they have discovered it. And if there
were truly such, undoutedly one of
the <hi>Parties</hi> would except against them,
or <hi>elude</hi> and <hi>prevent</hi> their judgement.
These matters have been <hi>agitated, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd</hi>
and <hi>determin'd</hi> also, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the most important <hi>questions</hi>

two great Popes, very <hi>learned,</hi> and of
<hi>upright Intentions:</hi> and you know
what have been the Issue of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
which lasted many years. You
are far from seeing your <hi>Affairs</hi> in so
fair a way; and if you promise your

self a better issue thereof, I attribute i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to your <hi>Zele,</hi> and the <hi>Affections</hi> you have
for the <hi>cause</hi> you manage; which makes
you build too much, and ground the
hopes of your justly desired succes,
upon the good reception that hath
been shewn you, and the fair words
which have been given you. You will
permit me to mind you, that that coin
is very current in the world, and more
in the place where you are, than in
any other: tis that wherewith all pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ordinarily made; and many
times where there is least <hi>Will</hi> and
<hi>Power</hi> to give, the promises are largest.—All
the <hi>proposals</hi> of <hi>Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> made you, touching the Bishop of
<hi>Ipres Book,</hi> seem to be as <hi>suspicious,</hi> as
the promises that are given you, and
are of much more <hi>dangerous consequence.</hi>
You know, Sir, by experience, in some
<hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular Assemblies</hi> of the
<hi>Facultie,</hi> in which you were present,
how all people easily hearkned unto
such <hi>Accommodations;</hi> how it is easie to
be inveigled to remit some thing of the
<hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> in such cases, either
by <hi>surprize,</hi> or by <hi>weaknes,</hi> covered


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34806:40"/>
with the pretext of peace; and how
such <hi>Accommodations</hi> and <hi>Modifications</hi>
are prejudicial to the <hi>Truth.</hi> These
are wounds which prove afterward
<hi>irremediable;</hi> because they are made
by such, as professe to defend it; and
in this they injure it, more than they,
who openly imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gne it, and are its
greatest enemies. I confesse to you, I
could never read without pitie (and I
speak it too without any indignation)
the <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Proposals</hi> made to
you, about the Bishop of <hi>Ipres</hi> Book,
and the Bull: and that which most
<hi>amazes me,</hi> is, that they which made
these <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Proposals,</hi> passe for
persons very <hi>intelligent,</hi> and well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
towards the <hi>Truths of Grace.</hi> For
to replie, that M. <hi>d' Ipre,</hi> intending to

he alone that hath written in that

those terms were abused, as well

proceeded so far, that in regard of the

at this day, the <hi>Enterprizers</hi> fear not to

but by <hi>invincible proofs,</hi> that we

shall manifest to your Holines, this

against that Saint, drawn out of
several Books made since fifty years,
by the <hi>Jesuits;</hi> which shew, that the
boldness, wherewith they assault him,
increases daily, in such sort, that they
incessantly charge him with new, and
greater outrages.—We know Most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father, that our Adversaries make
semblance of reverencing his <hi>Autoritie:</hi>
But this is only to put a feigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
upon their real disdain. 'Tis
only to hide their <hi>aversion</hi> from his

The Arguments, by which the <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senists</hi>
defend themselves against signing
this <hi>formularie</hi> are these. <q>1. That there
is no Ordinance of the Church, which
commands all the world to signe her

the Pope commands none to signe it;
neither has he as yet made any person
to signe it. 3. No one speaks of signing
this <hi>formularie</hi> in Forrein Provinces, nor
in the whole Church. 4. None but
the Assemblie of the Clergie has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
that we signe her <hi>formularie;</hi>
but this Ordinance is neglected by all
as illegitime, it having not been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

sent to <hi>Rome, (first</hi> in <hi>Manuscript,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

<hi>Denis Raymond</hi> in the Profession of his

makes this general Declaration. <q>That I
may leave no room for suspicion, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
farther, that by the sense of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius,</hi>
which I sustain, I intend no

actions of Pietie, in that manner, in
which it has ever been, and still is
sustained by the <hi>Schole of St. Thomas,</hi> and
is recognized as Orthodoxe by all the
Church; and I reject as an <hi>heresie</hi> that
saying, <hi>That this Efficacious Grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitates
the Will, and that it takes away

               <p>Paulus Irenaeus (<hi>to whom also we are

<hi>that the whole Doctrine of</hi> Jansenius,

1.</hi> That Efficacious Grace, by which the

is necessary to all good actions and to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

were the <hi>Sieurs de Lalane, Girard,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Arnauld</hi> (the Head of the <hi>Jansenists</hi>)
refused to ingage in this Conference, as

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vision he
had of its little successe. In the behalf
of the <hi>Molinists,</hi> there appeared none
but <hi>P. Ferrier</hi> the Jesuit, who was

in favor of the <hi>Jansenists,</hi> was,
<hi>that it should not be exacted from them,
any signature, touching the matter of fact,

<hi>Jansenists</hi> would not engage in this
<hi>Treatie of Accommodement,</hi> till there was
a Promise given them, <hi>that they would
not speak, either of signature, or of formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie;
and moreover, that the peace of the
Church should not be made to depend on

which the <hi>Molinists</hi> yielded unto,
gave the <hi>Jansenists,</hi> after the Treatie was

<q>In that say they, this whole <hi>Treatie</hi>
was on their part (<hi>viz.</hi> the Jesuits) no
other than one continued perfidie;
seeing that they have since avowed, that
they alwaies meant, they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the sense of <hi>Jansenius;</hi> that is
to say, that they should acknowledge,
that the Doctrine condemned in the

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Treatie</hi> began about <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
18.<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> 1663. (New Stile.) That which

                  <note place="margin">Refut. de P. Ferrier cap. 6.</note>
as the most proper expedient to
reconcile the two parties, was, that the
<hi>Jansenists,</hi> to free themselves from all
suspicion, should declare, <hi>That they had
no other sentiment about this matter, save
what was taught by the</hi> Thomists.<note place="margin">The main Article required of the <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> is that they conform to the <hi>Thomists.</hi>
                  </note> But
inasmuch as there is a difference amongst
the <hi>Thomists;</hi> and that (for example)
the manner of speech used by <hi>Gregory
Ariminensis, Estius</hi> and <hi>many others,</hi> is
different from that of <hi>Alvarez;</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linists</hi>
demanded, that the <hi>Jansenists</hi>
should reduce themselves, to the forme
of speech used by <hi>Alvarez,</hi> and others,
who writ according to his sentiment.
And the reason they alleaged of their
demand was, that <hi>Alvarez</hi> having as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
at the <hi>Congregations de Auxiliis,</hi>
there is a grand apparence, that he, and
those others who writ at the same
time, and since took up this <hi>mode</hi> of
speech to salve <hi>Libertie,</hi> according to the


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34806:59"/>
movements and sentiments which the
Popes <hi>Clement</hi> 8. and <hi>Paul</hi> 5th had; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they made no Decree on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It was added, that if the <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
would determine in this, all conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
would end; because the opinion
of these <hi>Thomists</hi> being taught as Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
there remained not betwixt the
<hi>Jansenists</hi> and the <hi>Molinists</hi> any more, than
the Contestation which has for a long
time been between the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hole of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,</hi>
and that of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> which
has not made any rupture of <hi>communion,</hi>
nor yet of <hi>charitie</hi> between these two
<hi>Orders.</hi> And in this their hearts would
be entirely reunited, albeit their Scholes
were not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jansenists</hi> answer to this <hi>Proposition</hi>
contained these two parts:<note place="margin">§. 18. The <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> Reply touching their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</hi>
                  </note> 1. That they
had refused, and that not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to tie themselves up generally by a
publick engagement, to all the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Alvarez;</hi> because he was not the
rule of the Church, or measure of their
faith. Yea, many famous <hi>Divines</hi> and
entire <hi>Faculties;</hi> as those of <hi>Lovain</hi> and
<hi>Doway,</hi> serve not themselves of all his


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34806:60"/>
expressions. 2. The other part of their
replie was a Declaration at the same
time, that there was in the explication
of their sentiments, which they were
disposed to give on the five Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that which was conforme, not only
to the Doctrine, but also to the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of these <hi>New Thomists.</hi> 
                  <q>The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
of St. <hi>Austin</hi> (adde they) have
alwaies said,<note place="margin">Refutat. du P. Ferrier cap. 6.</note> that the Doctrine of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius</hi>
on the five Propositions, seemed
not to them different from that of the
<hi>Thomists.</hi>
                  </q> And farther to vindicate
<hi>Jansenius</hi> from the imputation cast upon
him, touching his opposition to the
<hi>Thomists,</hi> they adde, <q>1. That the design
of <hi>Jansenius</hi> was not directly to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself conforme to the <hi>Thomists.</hi>
2. That yet in the chief of those points,
wherein the error of <hi>Jansenius</hi> is made
to consist, his Doctrine is not only by
<hi>consequence,</hi> but <hi>formally</hi> conforme to
that of the <hi>Thomists.</hi> 3. That the most
part of those general and indefinite
Propositions, by reason of which they
would fain perswade the world, that
<hi>Jansenius</hi> was opposite to the <hi>Thomists,</hi> he
himself in other parts of his Book does


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34806:60"/>
so restrain and limit, as that 'tis evident
he intended nothing lesse than <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformitie</hi>
to the <hi>Thomists.</hi>
                  </q> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it might be objected, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<hi>des Lettres au Provincial</hi> (which is
called the Mysterie of <hi>Jesuitisme</hi>) in his
second Letter, complains sadly against
the <hi>Thomists,</hi> for not publishing fully
what they understood by <hi>sufficient Grace:</hi>
the answer hereunto is, <q>That the said
ingenious Author used, and that not
without reason, somewhat more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
warmth and indignation against
some particular persons of the Order of
S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who being joined to the
<hi>Molinists</hi> by a <hi>Spirit of Cabal</hi> and of
<hi>faction,</hi> served themselves of the equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
term of <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> thereby to
deceive the world, as though they were
agreed.</q> In fine; the <hi>Jansenists</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>That the Doctrine of</hi> Jansenius,
<hi>touching the five Propositions, seemed to
them nothing different from that of the</hi>
Thomists: and to give a <hi>specimen</hi> hereof,
they instanced in the point of <hi>Efficacious
Grace; which said they, as it is explicated
by the defenders of</hi> Jansenius, <hi>is reduced
to this Proposition, common to all the</hi>

a very hard and unreasonable demand.

against the main <hi>Praeliminary</hi> Article,
granted in order to the <hi>Treatie.</hi> 2. If

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:34806:61"/>
3. They judged it too great

the Disciples of St. <hi>Austin</hi> (assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the five propositions condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were not to be found in <hi>Jansenius</hi>'s
book, nor yet condemned in his sense)
should be deceived in this their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Jansenius,</hi> yet, seeing they
condemned the five Propositions, as
well as others, their Error was not in
a question of <hi>Faith,</hi> but purely of <hi>fact,</hi>
such as could not bespeak them <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> 
                  <q>For, adde they, the common

the most simple, that two things
essentially separate, viz. a <hi>particular

be separated in the creance of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and therefore there is no sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
to imagine, but that one may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
is Haeretian, without assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they are to be found in the

after this Treatie drew up certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
(which I suppose were the same
with those they offered in the Treatie)
containing the explication of their own
sentiments, on the five condemned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.
These Articles they sent to
<hi>Rome,</hi> with their <hi>submission</hi> to the Pope,
not (as they phrase it) a <hi>submission of
Faith,</hi> but only a <hi>submission of Respect</hi>
or <hi>Discipline;</hi> which notwithstanding
was acceptable to the Pope. After this
Mr. <hi>De Lalane,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Girard</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
a Declaration to the King, by
the hand of the Bishop of <hi>Comenge,</hi>
containing the <hi>Abridgement</hi> of what they
had offered in the Treatie, and what
was comprehended in their Articles sent
to <hi>Rome.</hi> This Declaration having been
condemned by some of the Bishops, is
vindicated by a Letter from the Bishop

                  <q>I avow Sir, that it seemed to me,
after I had obliged those whom they

there could not be any more of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
or hereticks in the Church, the door
being shut both to <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>opiniatre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
In effect, Sir, in those Conferences,
which the Sieurs, the Abbot <hi>De Lalane</hi>
and <hi>Girard</hi> had, in the names of all those
who are engaged in this cause with
P. <hi>Ferrier</hi> the Jesuite, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to declare so neatly what was
their Doctrine on the subject of the
five Propositions condemned, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all that is called <hi>Jansenisme</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended)
as also to speak so precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the language of the <hi>Thomists,</hi> which
is received in the Church, that there
cannot remain any thing of Errour in
their Dogme,—In such sort, Sir,
that on the one side making them to
speak as the Catholick Schools speak;
and on the other side, they having sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselves to have no other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,

there remains not more of Error, or

why no <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>The true <hi>root</hi>
(sayes he) why no work <hi>morally</hi> good,
can be done without <hi>Grace</hi> freeing or
uncaptivating the <hi>will,</hi> is this: That
which by the bondage of Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
is taken from good works, is
not some <hi>supernaturalitie</hi> of the work,
or the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>merit,</hi> but it is the


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34806:71"/>
very <hi>formal Reason,</hi> by which a good
work is <hi>constituted</hi> such; so that upon
the defect thereof sin <hi>ipso facto</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
For the <hi>Pondus</hi> or weight of
<hi>Concupiscence,</hi> with which the soul is
possessed, wrests it from the love of
<hi>justice</hi> and <hi>rectitude,</hi> which is <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi>
and <hi>essentially</hi> required in every

2. lib. 1. cap. 6. fol. 86. <q>I find it, sayes

<hi>Austin, That Original sin is no otherwise
propagated, from the first man to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
but by the lust or Concupiscence of
the flesh;</hi> that by the magnitude of that
sin all humane nature should be vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For by this it comes to pass, that
this <hi>Concupiscential Law,</hi> or <hi>evil of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
being propagated, also Original
sin should be propagated.</q> This he does
more fully explicate in what follows,


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34806:72"/>
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 19. of this <hi>lib.</hi> 1. Where he proves
out of <hi>Austin,</hi> that good or evil <hi>Qualities</hi>
are <hi>propagated,</hi> not by <hi>Emigration,</hi> but
<hi>Afficiencie (i. e.</hi> by affecting what is
produced) by reason whereof there is
some like <hi>Qualitie</hi> propagated, as lights
are propagated by <hi>Afficiencie,</hi> without
<hi>emigration. Jansenius</hi> asserts here a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick

in the <hi>fancie</hi> of the Parent, for

that the depraved <hi>Imagination</hi> and
<hi>Lust</hi> of the Parents have a mighty force
and influence on the <hi>Morals</hi> of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
And whereas it may be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how the soul can receive <hi>Impuritie</hi>
from the bodie? he replies, that the
soul, by the defilement of the <hi>flesh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>fleshly:</hi> for the <hi>societie</hi> of <hi>sinful
flesh</hi> hinders it from <hi>savoring</hi> any thing

Where that which deserves special <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque</hi>
is, that he proves, against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

ignorance of what is our duty is both
sinful and punishable.</hi> His words are
these, <q>
                     <hi>Invincible ignorance,</hi> which flows

not without sin.</q> By <hi>invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
he means such as cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

he concludes, That the question is not
of <hi>invincible Ignorance,</hi> as to <hi>matter of

both which excuse from sin; but of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Ignorance</hi> as to the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or any branch thereof. Now that
this <hi>invincible Ignorance</hi> of <hi>Natures Law,</hi>
excuseth not from sin, he proves,
1. Because the knowledge of the said

                     <hi>fruition;</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> as an open stream

more manifest than <hi>Love:</hi> Wherefore
there is the greatest <hi>vicinitie</hi> betwixt
<hi>fruition</hi> and <hi>love;</hi> so that <hi>Austin,</hi> expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the reason of <hi>fruition,</hi> saies, that
to <hi>injoy any thing, is by love to adhere unto
it, for it self.</hi> For if we do not adhere
unto the thing for it self, we do not
properly love it, but that other thing,
for which we adhere to it. <hi>Fruition</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
is not <hi>love,</hi> but the <hi>fruit, effect,</hi>
and <hi>end</hi> thereof. For love when its
object is <hi>absent,</hi> breaks forth into <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;</hi>
and when <hi>present</hi> and possessed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>fruition</hi> and <hi>joy;</hi> which is the <hi>center</hi>
that <hi>terminates</hi> its <hi>motion.</hi> These things
being thus explicated; it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
(adds he) according to <hi>Austin,</hi>
that a <hi>rational creature</hi> may injoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but God only. For we injoy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that which we <hi>love for it self;</hi> wherein
our <hi>objective happiness</hi> consists—From this
<hi>immobile</hi> principle it follows. 1. That
all <hi>use</hi> of the creature, which is not
referred unto God, is <hi>sin.</hi> 2. That all
<hi>fruition</hi> of the creature, no lesse than
the love thereof, is <hi>sin.</hi> 3. That to

Whence sprang that rule of <hi>Austin,</hi> that
all <hi>human perversion is, when men would
enjoy things to be used, and use thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </q> For this is

(<hi>l. 1. c. 1. fol.</hi> 279.) to what the latter <hi>Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>

<hi>Aristotles rasa tabula,</hi> which he likened
the soul unto. Now that there cannot
be such a state of <hi>pure nature, Jansenius</hi>
proves, 1. From the order or regard a
rational creature has unto God, as his
<hi>first princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saies he, <q>'tis impossible that a <hi>rational
creature</hi> should be produced by God
in a connatural manner, without some
regard to his last and most connatural
end. So <hi>cap. 3. fol.</hi> 282. For, the reason
of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> and the connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
order of things require, that as
things proceed from a <hi>first principle,</hi>
so they tend to some <hi>last</hi> end. Yea,
this flows from the very <hi>Institution of
Human Nature,</hi> and is founded in its
very <hi>Essence,</hi> that it adhere to God, as
its <hi>supreme principle</hi> and <hi>last end.</hi> Which
not to do is sin. 2. Seeing a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot be made without a will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
inclined to God as Creator,
hence followeth a necessitie of Grace,


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34806:80"/>
to inspire this will, whereby the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie
of a <hi>state of pure nature</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. All love terminates ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the creature, and so 'tis <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,</hi>
or on God, and so 'tis <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Charitie,</hi> or love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Whence it
follows, there can be no middle state
'twixt sin and Grace, because the will
alwayes adheres to God or the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Jansenius</hi> proceeds to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,<note place="margin">§. 11. Love to God in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, both natural and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note>
                  <hi>That Love to God was in the state

So <hi>Tom. 2. de Pur. Nat. l. 1. c.</hi> 15. <q>If (saies he) a rational creature cannot be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
without love to God, then hence
occurs a weighty difficultie, whether
this love may be stiled <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural:</hi>
a <hi>debt</hi> or <hi>Grace.</hi> To
which he replies thus: It seems to me
that both may be affirmed without
<hi>a contradiction.</hi> That this love is <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural,</hi>
is beyond controversie
amongst all <hi>Catholicks;</hi> for, as eternal

the way thereto, is in like manner <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural:</hi>


                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34806:80"/>
for though one and t'other
be the action of a creature, yet neither
flows from the principles of <hi>nature,</hi> or
natural faculties and force. This love
to God may be called also <hi>natural,</hi> not
only as <hi>consentaneous</hi> unto <hi>Nature;</hi> but
1. On the part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>reason:</hi> as the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

to be beloved above all, and that by
the most natural, strict and universal
obligation, than which nothing is more
<hi>moral, essential,</hi> and eternally obliging
to <hi>human Nature,</hi> &amp;c. 2. This love of
God may be said to be <hi>natural,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the will, as God is the most
<hi>natural end</hi> of its choice, according to
that of <hi>Scotus,</hi> God is the <hi>natural end of

                  <note place="margin">Whether this love to God be a debt to human Nature.</note> 17. <hi>fol. 312. Whether this love to

which he replies, <q>1. That God is to
be loved by his creature in every state.
2. That this love, although it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentaneous
to <hi>human nature,</hi> yet it is the
effect of <hi>supernatural Grace.</hi> 3. Hence
(saies he) it is most safe to affirme,

that a rational creature considered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>Jansenius</hi> proceeds <hi>cap. 20. fol.</hi> 320.
to shew how this love to God, though a
debt due to human Nature, proceeds
notwithstanding from Grace. 1. There
are, saies he, certain debts or decent
<hi>connaturalities,</hi> congruencies, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which spring not from the right
of the creature, but from the Grace
of God. For God is oft said to be a
<hi>debtor</hi> to himself, his own attributes,
not only to his <hi>Justice,</hi> but also to his
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Again,
the very <hi>nature</hi> of a Rational creature,
is the gratuitous and free gift of God;
so in like manner the <hi>rectitude</hi> of the
same nature, which though inseparable,
yet it ariseth not from any <hi>merit</hi> of the


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34806:81"/>
creature, but from such arguments or
reasons as concerne the attributes of
God, his Wisdom and Goodnes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From the foresaid <hi>hypothesis,</hi>

                  <hi>that there

Jansenius</hi> rationally concludes against,
and rejects that usual distinction amongst

into <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>supernatural, &amp;c.</hi> So
<hi>Tom. 2. de Nat. Pura lib. 2. cap. 2. fol.</hi> 326.
Where he tells us, <q>That he has oft
wondred how it came to pass, that the
ancient Philosophers, <hi>Socrates, Plato, &amp;c.</hi>
discoursed more accurately, and truly
of the lapsed state of man, than the
late Scholemen? Neither addes he,
can I find any other reason hereof than
this, that the late <hi>Scholemen</hi> have all
followed the pur-blind reasonings of
<hi>Aristotle;</hi> who being ignorant of his
own imbecillitie, and not sensible of any
supernatural <hi>adjutorie,</hi> taught men to
expect all good from their own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence the <hi>Pelagians</hi> sucked all
their poison: which the Scholemen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring
to moderate and allay, have
framed two men in one, a Philosopher,


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34806:82"/>
and a Christian: Whence, what ever
they find in the Philosopher, touching
<hi>free will</hi> or <hi>natural virtue</hi> they apply
to their Philosopher; and whatever
they find in Scripture, touching Grace,
they refer to their Christian. Thus
they frame a double virtue and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
one <hi>natural,</hi> another <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
So again, <hi>Jansen. Tom. 2. lib.</hi> 4.
<hi>de Grat. Christi, cap. 16. fol.</hi> 255. The
Scholemen, saies he, finding the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
Infusions touching <hi>seeds of virtue,</hi>
repugnant to the <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi>
they frame a <hi>double man</hi> in a <hi>single,</hi>

double works;</hi> the one <hi>natural,</hi> the <hi>other

the Philosophers and Scholemens natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

<hi>de pur. Nat. lib. 2. c. 5. fol.</hi> 332. The

man cannot be in a connatural mode

they are forced to coin a twofold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude,

That as this <hi>state of pure Nature</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34806:82"/>
its original from the error of
<hi>Gentile Philosophie;</hi> so likewise this
imagination of natural happines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
In brief, he demonstrates clearly, that
these common notions, so frequent in
the Scholes, touching <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
virtues</hi> and happines, as distinct
from <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>supernatural,</hi> are but
a meer <hi>chimera,</hi> or figment, hatcht first
in the Gentile Scholes, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Scholemen</hi>
into the Christian Scholes, with no small
prejudice to the Christian Faith.</q> That
there cannot indeed be any action or
work <hi>naturally</hi> or <hi>morally</hi> good, but
what is such <hi>supernaturally</hi> and <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
is very evident, because the rule of
all good, whether <hi>natural, moral,</hi> or
<hi>spiritual</hi> is one and the same, namely, the
Will of God revealed in the Moral Law,
which gives the <hi>esse morale,</hi> the <hi>moral
Being, moralitie</hi> or <hi>formal constitution to
all moral good</hi> or virtue, whether <hi>natural</hi>

Whence the question is resolved into

<q>The knowledge of the Law, (saies he)
although it removes the ignorance of

of righteousnes is greatly deceived.
For lust being repressed, is increased;
and being like to be deprived of its
lusted good, it burnes more strongly for
the injoyment of it. Yea, the Law is
so far from lessening sin, as that it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
the same, and shuts up the

                  </gap> the term or center; this is the fault

                  </gap> him that fears, not of the fear. He
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en distinguisheth 'twixt <hi>ordinate</hi> and

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ordinate fear</hi> of Hell: <q>
                     <hi>Ordinate</hi> is that
whereby the fault is more feared than
the punishment; <hi>inordinate,</hi> when the
punishment is feared more than the
fault; which some call <hi>servile fear.</hi>
Thence he leads us to the Spring-head
of this fear of Hell, shewing, how it
springs not from a <hi>spirit of Adoption,</hi>
which inspires <hi>coelestial suavities</hi> into
the heart; but from the <hi>spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi>
or a certain <hi>general Grace</hi> of
of God. Yet addes he, this fear of
Hell is attributed to the Grace of God,
because 1. It proceeds from a <hi>Legal
faith</hi> of Gods Eternal Judgement, which
is a gift of God. 2. God followes this
apprehension of future Judgement with
<hi>comminations, threats,</hi> and <hi>commotions</hi> of
Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. God works this
fear by softening the heart; and that
either by the <hi>immission</hi> of temporal tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
or by the <hi>ablation</hi> of carnal
delights, which harden Conscience.</q> 
Thence he shews, <hi>cap.</hi> 25. that this fear
of Hell is not from the special grace of


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34806:90"/>
Christ, 1. Because it produceth a Legal
Righteousness. 2. It does not sever the
heart from sin; because the sinner flies
not from sin, but from punishment; he
abhors sin, not as sin, but as <hi>dolorifick</hi>
or painfull: there remains still in such,
a depraved will, which is chained by
fear of Hell, but not mortified or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht.
Hence <hi>cap.</hi> 35. he proceeds to
Explicate the good effects of this <hi>legal
fear</hi> in order to a <hi>thorough conversion:</hi>
and so he concludes, that this <hi>servile fear
of hell,</hi> as 'tis fear, so 'tis good, but as
<hi>servile,</hi> so 'tis evil.</p>

                  </note> its <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi>
he returns again to the main hindge or
head of the Controversie, to discourse
more fully of <hi>Free-will,</hi> its <hi>nature,</hi> &amp;c.
Thus <hi>Tom. 3. de Grat. lib. 6. cap. 1. &amp;c.
fol.</hi> 255. where he begins with this sad
Lamentation: <q>There is deserved and
great matter of grief, that some
are so given to human, and for the
most part fallacious r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tiocinations, as
that they suppose it more meet to draw
the intelligence of <hi>free-will</hi> from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>


                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:34806:90"/>
and the <hi>Gentile Philosophie,</hi> than
from the bosom of the ancient Church:
namely, because this matter exceeds not
the bounds of natural reason, therefore
(as they conceit) it must be measured
by reason. Neither indeed is the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian
haeresie</hi> concerning Grace and
Free-will any other than pure <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telick
Philosophie.</hi>
                  </q> Hence he goes on to
prove, <hi>that Free-will according to</hi> Austin,
<hi>signifies nothing more than the power or
act of the will, which is alone properly
and immediately free, whereas the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is free, only by participation from the
will.</hi> Then he proceeds to shew,
(<hi>cap. 3. &amp;c.</hi>) That <hi>free</hi> is opposed to
<hi>servile</hi> or <hi>captive,</hi> and implies somewhat
<hi>positive,</hi> which is nothing else but to be
<hi>sui juris,</hi> under its <hi>own power,</hi> and so to
<hi>act freely,</hi> is to have our act in our <hi>own
power,</hi> i. e. in the <hi>power</hi> of our own will:
So amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that is stiled

Whence it comes to passe, that look

                     <hi>That to predestinate
properly signifies to praedecree, praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,

                     </gap> signifies, as <hi>Rom.</hi>

                     </gap> is
sometimes rendred simply to <hi>decree;</hi>
because to decree with God is the same

<hi>fol.</hi> 366 he concludes, That from this
principle 'tis no way difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
many <hi>Scholastick Questions.</hi> For
hence 'tis manifest, 1. That the object
of Predestination is not things eternal,


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34806:93"/>
but temporal. 2. That Gods Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
regards his own affairs: things
to be done by him, not meerly by
others. For we decree things we are
to do, either by <hi>working, commanding</hi> or
<hi>persuading,</hi> &amp;c. 3. That Gods Decrees
regard both <hi>end</hi> and means: for they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all God does. 4. Hence also it comes
to passe, that children may be predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
to glory without <hi>previous faith,</hi>
as well as persons <hi>adult</hi> by <hi>ordinate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi>
for there is no difference in the
Decree. 5. That Predestination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
not only <hi>Good,</hi> but also <hi>Evil, &amp;c.</hi>

Hence <hi>Jansenius (cap.</hi> 5.) proceeds to

                  <q>which, saies he, is expressed in
Scripture by many <hi>aequipollent</hi> names:
for sometimes 'tis called <hi>Dilection;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God by it wills nothing but good
to his creature. Sometimes 'tis termed
<hi>Election;</hi> because he chooseth one and
refuseth another: sometimes 'tis stiled
<hi>Purpose;</hi> because it is not a <hi>sterile dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
but an efficacious decree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
some benefit. Lastly, 'Tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

an <hi>absolute purpose, cap.</hi> 21. 6. Then
he concludes (<hi>cap.</hi> 25.) that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>nature</hi> and <hi>profunditie</hi> of <hi>free Grace</hi>


                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:34806:94"/>

               <p>Hence <hi>Jansenius</hi> proceeds to discourse
of <hi>Reprobation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 26. Of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</note> which he makes to be

includes also <hi>positive.</hi> The like
he farther inculcates, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <q>But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Austin</hi> (addes he) there
is no <hi>negative Reprobation</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
because in every <hi>signe</hi> or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of Divine account, it ever has
adjoined to it (by reason of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

<hi>positive Reprobation.</hi> Then having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
at large of the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>


                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:34806:95"/>
of this <hi>positive absolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(cap. 5. 9. 13. &amp;c.</hi>) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>with an Apologie for God his
sovereintie, and just procedure herein,
(cap.</hi> 17.) It may not (saies he)
seem a wonder to any, that God
should <hi>create, conserve,</hi> and <hi>governe</hi>
such a number of <hi>Reprobates</hi> without
any purpose of saving them. For
they serve for that purpose to which
they are meet, and very necessary in
this state of matters: namely, that in
them the severitie and justice of
Divine Vengeance against sin,<note place="margin">Against Universal Grace.</note> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the magnitude of <hi>mercie</hi> towards
the Elect might be shown forth.
For they who have coined that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick</hi>
kind of Predestination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God is exposed and brought in,
as <hi>ready to pour out his Graces indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
unto all, that he who will may
free himself;</hi> whilest they seem to lay
open the bowels of <hi>Election</hi> towards
all, they do wholly evacuate the
whole of Gods love towards the
<hi>Elect,</hi> which is so greatly applauded
in the Scriptures, and S. <hi>Austin, &amp;c.</hi>


                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:34806:95"/>
Lastly, <hi>Jansenius (fol.</hi> 446.) draws a
lively and large parallel 'twixt the
<hi>Semipelagians</hi> and these New Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
or <hi>Molinists</hi> in all points of moment
referring to Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Jansenius</hi> (as also his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade
St. <hi>Cyran</hi>)<note place="margin">§. 27. Against Scholastick Theologie.</note> entertained a deep
displeasure against that <hi>abstruse, cloudy,</hi>
and <hi>wrangling</hi> kind of <hi>Theologie</hi> brought
in by the Scholemen, in imitation of
<hi>Aristotle, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Jansen. Tom. 2. de

shewes, how the Scholemen suckt in

of <hi>pure Nature, Free will, &amp;c.</hi> Thus
they joined <hi>Aristotle</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> and
his <hi>Philosophie</hi> with the Scripture, as
<hi>Dagon</hi> with the Ark. So again <hi>Tom.</hi> 2.
<hi>lib. proaem. cap.</hi> 28. he saies, that the

Hence that <hi>ardor</hi> of questioning


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34806:96"/>
and disputing every thing. Hence
their Theologie became stuffed with

by the <hi>Sectators</hi> of <hi>Jansenius,</hi>
who in the general touching their sense
of <hi>Jansenius,</hi> refer us to the first and
third Disquisition of <hi>Paul Ireneus,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the first and fourth part of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Raymond,</hi> Wherein (say they) the
<hi>Jansenists</hi> have declared exactly what
they understand by the <hi>sense of Janseni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi>
Moreover how far they symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
with, and are willing to conforme
unto, the expressions of the <hi>Thomists</hi> has
been before in the <hi>historick narrative</hi>
sufficiently mentioned. But to give


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34806:96"/>
some particular <hi>Dogmes</hi> of the <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
as to faith.</p>
               <p>1. They generally (following <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius</hi>
and St. <hi>Cyran</hi> herein) begin to
have a good esteem of the <hi>Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:</hi>
and to vindicate much their
perfection as the only rule of faith:
I met with this expression in one of
their Papers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>La simple Verite a Paris.</hi> 1664.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. That it is an heresie
to judge of heresies without the Word of God.</hi>
This farther appears by their late Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>2. As for <hi>Jansenius's</hi> Doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>efficacious Grace,</hi> they reduce it to
this Proposition maintained by all the
<hi>Thomists,</hi> viz. <hi>That all the Grace of Christ
is efficaciously productive of some effect to
which it is nextly ordained, and which
God by an absolute will, intends.</hi> So <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
du P. Ferrier c.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>3. Hence they allow not any Grace
to be <hi>sufficient,</hi> but what is also <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi>
So <hi>Refutat. du P. Ferrier, c.</hi> 11.
<hi>pag.</hi> 64. <q>Because (say they) this
word <hi>Grace sufficient</hi> is not to be found,
either in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or in the
<hi>Councils,</hi> or in the <hi>Fathers, &amp;c.</hi>


                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:34806:97"/>
therefore no Jesuit has right to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to make use of it farther than
we please.</q> And to shew their dislike
of this <hi>sufficient Grace,</hi> which the

a while since, in a Shew at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
framed a Chariot wherein sat two
<hi>Virgins;</hi> the one with fair and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

which they called <hi>sufficient Grace;</hi> the

to <hi>Justification by Free Grace,</hi> and
<hi>Faith</hi> in the blood of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard to <hi>human merits</hi> as
abused in the Popish sense. 'Tis true
they make use of the name <hi>merit,</hi> but
in no other sense than it was used by
<hi>Austin,</hi> without any approbation of
the thing, as the ground of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This is manifest not only from
their <hi>Books,</hi> but also by their <hi>Practice.</hi>
It was the usual method of <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>


                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:34806:97"/>
for the comforting of afflicted
consciences, to send them to the <hi>blood
of Christ alone:</hi> and Mr. St <hi>Cyran</hi> seems
mighty warme and pressing on this
point. The like instances I have had
touching others of this persuasion in
<hi>France,</hi> who being to deal with dying
persons, insisted much upon pressing
them to have recourse to the blood of
Christ.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed are the <hi>Jansenists</hi>
verst only in <hi>speculative</hi> and <hi>notional,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 29. Their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie.</note>
but also in <hi>practick</hi> and <hi>active Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;</hi>
especially the chief of them <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius</hi>
and St. <hi>Cyran</hi> seem to have had
a very <hi>deep, broad, spiritual</hi> light and
insight into the Mysteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and true Godlines; and I am
apt to persuade my self, they had some
feeling apprehensions and inward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with those choice Gospel
truths, they commend to others. They
talk much of studying the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
and acquainting our selves with the
mind and Spirit of God therein; they


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34806:98"/>
presse, with some affectionate impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie,
to the renouncing our own
righteousnesse, strength, wisdom, wills,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> They greatly commend to us
spiritual povertie, soul-humilitie, heart-mortification,
self-emptinesse, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things they insist
upon, not according to the <hi>Monkish
mode</hi> of external mortification, but in
a Gospel strain, with so much meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of wisdom, and yet with so much
spiritual passion and warmth, as if
their words were but sparks, or ideas
of that Divine fire which burned in
their hearts. This I have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
observed in Mr. St. <hi>Cyrans</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
in reading whereof, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
his expressions with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and Idea I have of his Spirit,
and life, I must confesse I have been
much recreated. But thus much of their
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:34806:98"/>
The <hi>Jansenists</hi> begin also to have
very <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>favorable persuasions</hi>
about <hi>Church Discipline;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their principles of Church Discipline.</note> as it appears
by these particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. They are come now generally to
disavow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. That there is no human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge in matters of Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>not only the</hi> Popes, <hi>but all</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Infallibilitie. <hi>This is one of the
last refuges they have made use of
against their adversaries, as it appears
by a Paper of theirs lately publisht,

                  <q>One ought not to hold for Hereticks
any, but such as resist an Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in matters of faith. Now its
certain, the Pope has not such an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie.
Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
adde they, is clear; (as well as
the first;) for an Infallible Autoritie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. Hence they also hold,<note place="margin">2. That the definition of Dogmes belongs to the Word, and the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of facts to the Church; to which we owe only a submission of respect, not of Faith.</note> that the
<hi>Definition of Dogmes and submission of
faith thereto, belongs only to the Word
of God; which they make to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

So the Bishop of <hi>Comenge</hi> in
his Letter to the King, <hi>an.</hi> 1664.
touching the <hi>Jansenists,</hi> speaks thus of
them; <q>It is true, <hi>Sire,</hi> that they place
not in the same rank the submission
which they render to the Definition
of <hi>Dogmes,</hi> and that which they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Definition of <hi>particular
facts;</hi> because the one is a <hi>submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faith,</hi> and the other a <hi>submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of respect,</hi> and of <hi>Discipline.</hi> The
truth, <hi>Sire,</hi> of things revealed by
God, may not enter into compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

                     <hi>Dogmes</hi> are revealed, and not <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
by the whole Church; to the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

                     </gap>
                     <hi>submission of faith,</hi> and to the other


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34806:99"/>
with a <hi>submission of pure respect.</hi> Thus
also the <hi>Jansenists</hi> themselves, in their
<hi>La simple verité, à Paris</hi> 1664. The
common light of reason (say they)
shews, even to the most grosse, that
two things that are essentially sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as a particular <hi>fact,</hi> and a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of faith,</hi> may be also separate in
the creance of believers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence
also the <hi>Jansenists</hi> assert,</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. That the Church has only a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative
power,</hi> and that as to <hi>matters
of fact</hi> and <hi>Discipline;</hi> i. e. <hi>Ministerial</hi>
only, and <hi>subordinate</hi> unto that of Christ.
This is evident by their <hi>La simple Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rité
pag.</hi> 60. <q>In the state of this life the
Church demands of her children no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but love and accord: and the
obedience she requires of them, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>facts</hi> which she decides, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>modestie</hi> and <hi>peace;</hi> not a
<hi>creance</hi> or belief. She commands them
to believe nothing, but what she has
learnt of Jesus Christ. She declares to
them his <hi>Word,</hi> not her own; leaving
to them, as other things, so also that


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34806:100"/>
                     <hi>libertie,</hi> which he has given unto them;
provided, that they loose not that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi>
which they owe to their <hi>Mother,</hi>
and trouble not the union of her
children.</q> Thus the <hi>Jansenists</hi> of the
Churches Power and Discipline.</p>
               <p>4. Hence also,<note place="margin">4. Libertie of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> as it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
the <hi>Jansenists</hi> allow, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

matters of fact, and Ecclesiastick deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
about things indifferent,</hi> or
things not clearly revealed. This evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appears by, and flows from what
was lastly mentioned of them: where
all that they require to the Churches
definitions, is only a <hi>submission of respect;</hi>
and in case of difference in persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
a <hi>respectuous silence,</hi> so far as the
Churches <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> require<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
