            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Think my ſelf, and the Gentlemen and others you know to be now engaged with me, have no hopes by new Troubles to better our preſent condition; with thankfulneſs we may ſay it, God hath made our Lot larger than our Deſires in that kind; and we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by that bleſſing, put an obligation upon us, as we are conſiderable Members of our Countrey, to have more ſober and couragious thoughts in time of extremity than other men have: And though the Indifference that lies upon other mens ſpirits might flat ours, yet we tannot think, but if it were repreſented to them, how the preſent Power doth obliege us to put out our <hi>right Eyes,</hi> when they require us to acknowledge them as a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and lay upon us ſuch heavy and grievous Burthens, and ſuch deceitful ones, as a Years Tax in Three Moneths, beſides the many other Impoſitions of Exciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by raiſing among us a <hi>Militia,</hi> they cut off our <hi>right Hand,</hi> by ſubjecting us under the meaneſt and moſt fanatick Spirits of the Nation, under pretence of Protection; their ſpirits would be warmed into the ſame zeal and indignation that ours are kindled with. Now conſider what it is we ask, and conſider whether it be not the ſame thing we have aſſerted with our Lives and Fortunes? <hi>A Free Parliament:</hi> And what a ſlavery it is to our Underſtandings, that theſe men that now call themſelves a <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſhould declare it an act of Illegality and Violence in the late aſpiring General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to diſſolve their Body in 1653. and not make it the like in the garbling the whole Body of the Parliament from 400 to 40, in 1648. What is this, but to act what they condemne in others? Why do they aſſociate themſelves to the preſent Army, or indeed to the preſent Commanders in chief, and keep out their numerous and fellow-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if committing Violence on a Parliament be ſo notorious a crime? And how do they teach the Souldiers boldly to do that, which themſelves practiſe, and make them Inſtruments of? What is this, but under another ſhape to act the condemned acts of Uſurpation and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in their old General? What is this, but to neceſſitate men to complain? and upon Complaints, to be invaded by their power, ſo to raiſe (if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits be not diſſolved into baſeneſs and aptitude for Slavery) a Civil War, and to endevour to water their owne root with the blood of many thouſands of their Countrey-men; or to gape after thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations, which by a Victory, upon preſumption of the unity of their Army, they hope to gain over all thoſe that dare with danger aſſert their Liberties, (which preſumption yet may fail them; for the Souldier hath, and may declare himſelf, no <hi>Mercenary</hi> but an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freeman; which indeed, thought it be now contrary to his actions, may return into his thoughts again:) And what will be the iſſue of all this? A mean and Schiſmatical party muſt depreſs the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Underſtanding Commons; the Land muſt waſte it ſelf, and Forainers, or others, muſt take the advantage of all. I dare ſay, I profeſs for my ſelf, and the greateſt part with me, we have no aſpect but this ſingly, that we be not poſſeſt, as Waſte Ground is, only by the title of Occupancy, or that the next that gets into the Saddle ride us. Let the Nation freely chooſe their Repreſentatives, and they as freely ſit without awe or force of Souldiery; and whatever in ſuch an Aſſembly is determined, ſhall be by us freely and cheerfully ſubmitted unto. If this ſatisfie you, I am glad of it, for you are my noble Friend. I uſe it not as an Artifice either to engage you, or to make other Counties follow our Example. Which if they doe not, let their poſterity judge their action and ours: For we were born for our <hi>Countrey;</hi> and our Countrey, our Religion and Laws are in danger, and we will not be unconcerned: But we are faithful and peaceful in the Land, and if they in Authority will decline hoſtility, and agree of a means to admit the old Members of both Houſes, or to call a new Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Let him be (and he only is truly) a Traitor, that reſolves not his Judgement and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience into their Determinations.
