            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thys fearefull aspect did wonderfullie daunt mee, with doubt of some angry accident that might shortly betide me; And I had not paced many steppes, but directly in the path before me, there appeared a most grislie ghost wrapt vp in a sheete, his face onely discouered, with a penne vnder his eare, and holding a scrowle of written paper in his hande. I crosled the way of purpose to shunne him, but crosse as I could he was euer-more before mee, that passe I might not, vnlesse I should runne ouer him; I remembred my selfe how old Fathers were wont to say, that Spirits in such cases, had no power to speake to any man, vntill they were first spoken vnto, and therefore taking vnto me a constrained courage, I asked him what he was, &amp; what was his meaning

            <p>Why (saide I) this is a pitteous case, that hauing such infinite busines, as I perceiue by your spceches, that he hath not some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants to helpe him, &amp; that so many troubles should not lye all on one mans necke.</p>

            <p>I woulde very faine haue replyed in mine owne excuse, but S. <hi>Peter</hi> cut me off, telling me that I was aunswered, and that hauing mine aunswere, I shoulde trouble him no further. And foorthwith speaking to hym that stood next m√©e, asked hym his name. Who told hym that he was called <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet breeches.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> asked hym further, what Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was. He aunswered an <hi>Englishman.</hi> I cannot think you to be a naturall <hi>Englishman,</hi> sayd S. <hi>Peter,</hi> for that I neuer heard of any of your name in that Country. Yes Syr (if it please you) said <hi>Veluet breeches,</hi> my auncesters came in with the Conquest, and my predecessours haue still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Gentlemen both of Worship and credite.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Veluet breeches</hi> had ended these words, there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come by, diuers Princes that had raigned Kinges of <hi>England,</hi> all of them mounted vpon great Horsses, and had b√©ene abroade vppon the gr√©ene running at the King: the which Princes being espyed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he called vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, requesting them a little to stay: and then poynting to <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet breeches,</hi> he demaunded if any of them did knowe hym, or any of hys name remaining in <hi>Englande,</hi> in the tyme of theyr raignes and gouernments? But they denayed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that euer they had seene hym, or euer known any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of English byrth that was of his name.</p>
            <p>Amongst this royall troupe, was King <hi>Henry</hi> the thyrd,

and he confidently protested, y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> in the time of his raigne, there was no such person to be found, for said hee, I sent one of my seruants to buy me a payre of hose, and hee returned againe with a payre that was but of sixe shillinges and eyght pence the price: wherewith I being displeased, folde him that I would haue had hym bestowed a marke of a payre, but hee said there were none such to be gotte. But as for the other <hi>Cloth breeches</hi> that standeth by hym, I know him very wel by his lookes, he dooth so much resemble his auncesters, and hath the very liuely picture of his Predecessours, the which were very honest plaine dealing men, without any manner of falshood or deceite.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> thanked them of their paines, and thus the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces departed, who beeing gone, S. <hi>Peter</hi> saide: You haue heard Ma. <hi>Veluet breeches</hi> what hath passed, but yet because you haue auouched your selfe to be a Gentleman, you shall haue thys fauour, we will examine some other of later time, who peraduenture may better call you to remembraunce. There stoode a Messenger by, whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> willed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to goe fetch hym some <hi>Englishman,</hi> that was but of some tenne or twenty y√©eres residence in the place, charging hym to goe with sp√©ede, and to make a quicke returne. The Messenger met with a company that were newe come out of a Tennis courte, amongst whom was a Mearcer, that within these tenne y√©eres had dwelt in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> hym the Messenger brought to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who demaunded of him, if he did know a Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> called by the name of Ma. <hi>Veluet breeches.</hi> Yea marry sayde the Mearcer, I know him to my cost, for thys is he that standes by me, and heere I auouch it before his face that hee is no Gentleman, but a proude dissembler, and a cosoning counterfeite: which if it shal please you to giue me leaue, I will proue before this holy companie. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> aunswered, we doo not onelie giue you leaue, but also doe straightly commaunde you to spe√°ke a truth, and withall, to speake no more then is truth, what you are able to charge him withall, and howe you are able to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>H√©ere was now a Maister and a man well met, for the Maister meant to vse his man but to serue his turne for a poynt of cosonage, and the man meant to vse his Maister, til he might finde oportunity, to runne away with his purse or some other of his apparrell, as he had doone before with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.

            <p>I hearing his smooth sp√©eches deliuered vnder pretence of honesty, and s√©eming otherwise, both in the show of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell and the dutifull attendance of his man, that hee had b√©ene (ind√©ede) some Gentleman of reputation and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coning, desirous so much the rather to win such a customer, I tolde him that I woulde not onely fitte him with as good stuffe as any man in <hi>London</hi> should shew hym, but also in the price I would vse him with such reason, as in any other place they were able to affoorde him: the which promise (in very d√©ede) I meant faithfully to performe.</p>

I very loath to driue him away, pitcht him a price so reasonable, as in truth I was not able better cheape to affoord them: but hys mind being onely sette vppon coso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, told me he durst not aduenture to gyue so much mony, and thus away he went.</p>
            <p>Within an houre after, hauing sent away his man, which of purpose he had doone, he returned againe, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in my shop, he asked me if I would abate no money in my stuffe: I thinking hee had b√©ene some other where to cheapen, told him I had rated them so reasonably, as I was able to affoord them: and that I was sure, in anie shoppe where he had since b√©ene, he had not found the like wares for the like price.</p>
            <p>Nay truelie, (sayde hee) I haue not beene in any other place to cheapen any such stuffe, but yet since I left your house I haue disbursed fortie poundes in other thinges, that I haue sent to my Lodging by my man: but I s√©e you are hard, and yet sith I haue dealt thus farre with you, I will not forsake you, come therefore and cutte me of the parcels. The which accordingly I did, and laying them together, h√©e desired me to cast the totall summe, the which as before I haue sayd, amounted to fifty and od pounds.</p>
            <p>Syr, (sayd h√©e) I must craue to borrow one of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, to helpe me home with thys stuffe, and hee shall bring you your money: I haue sent mine owne man about busines, and haue no body heere nowe to helpe mee.

            <p>
               <hi>Margery,</hi> (sayd the) the day is nowe come for the which you haue so much longed after, it is twenty y√©eres agoe since you first wished for a Husband, and byr Lady daughter you were then seauent√©ene or eyghteene y√©eres of age, so that at this present you want not aboue two or thr√©e of forty: nowe if wit went by y√©eres, you are olde enough to be wise, but I being your Mother, besides my many y√©eres which might aduaunce my skill, so I haue buried foure seueral husbands, (the heauens be praised for it) which hath so much the more confirmed my experience in the dispositions of men, and can the better iudge of their naturall inclinations: and by all that I haue gathered by mine owne proofe and practise, I haue found it still by tryall, that the fantasies of men, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore best fitted with the follies of women. But leauing generalities, and to come to so much as concerneth but thy selfe, that art now to be married to a husband, who in respect of his age thou mightest be his Mother: and couldest thou now but consider, what a comfort it is for an olde Woman, to be louingly embraced by a you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g man, O daughter daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thy mothers mouth begins to water, but with the verie imagination to thinke of the pleasure, and therefore happie maiest thou deeme thy selfe, that art so likely to enioy it.</p>
            <p>But h√©ere is now a great p√©ece of discretion to be vsed, for as age conceiueth such contentment with the societie of fresh and pleasant youth, so youth will quickly fall a loathing

               </gap> they be spent in y√©eres: for it is a tyred Iade that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cry weehee, and a sorry Mare that cannot wag her taile. Thou art nowe to consider the inequalitie of the yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thy selfe and thy husbande, and therefore a little to whet him on to make him to like of th√©e the better, it shal not be amisse for thee to shew some youthfull conceite, especially being thy bridall day, it is tollerable for th√©e a little to play the wanton.</p>
            <p>I can tell th√©e daughter, men are well pleased to s√©e theyr Wiues youthfully gyuen, and there is nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth more delight them, then to s√©e them wantonly disposed: and thys is the meane to winne your husbands lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Margery</hi> making a mannerly curtsie, said: Yes forsooth Mother, I will remember all that you haue told me.</p>
            <p>By this time all things being prepared, to Church we went, where the Priest hauing once doone his office, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe, and were accompanied with our neighbours and freendes that went home to dinner with vs: for whom there was prouided Fyrmentie and Minced Pyes, besides other good meate both roste and sodde: the which being all ready, <hi>Margery</hi> was placed at the vpper end, between two of the most substantiall honest men, according to the custome of the Parrish, and my selfe likewise, (as the manner was) did waite that day at the Table, with a napkin hanging on my shoulder.</p>
            <p>But O what a comfort it was vnto me, to s√©e how dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>Margery</hi> fedde of euery dish that came neere her, and how lustily she laid about her for her victuales And (thought I) if it be true as some will say, that a good f√©eding Horse will goe through with his labour, then I warrant if I gyue <hi>Margery</hi> her meate, I neede not feare to ryde her where I

But Dinner beeing almost at an ende, and the Cake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breade and Ch√©ese ready to be sette on the Table, the good old Woman her Mother, who had likewise beene very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie that day in taking paynes to fill the pottes, and to carrie away emptie dishes, beganne to cheere vppe the companie, bidding them welcome, and telling them she was sorry there was no better ch√©ere for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margery</hi> presently vpon the sight of her Mother bethought herselfe what she had to doo, and calling now to minde what lesson she had gyuen her, and howe shee had willed her that day to showe some youthfull tricke, thereby to purchase the fauour of her husband, and picking out at that very instant a fitte opportunity to performe it, she called to her Mother in thys youthfull manner, <hi>Munna, vppe and cacke.</hi> The olde Woman hearing her Daughter, sayd: Why how now <hi>Margerie?</hi>

            <p>The neighbours s√©eing the clenlinesse of the wench, did euer after that call her by the name of <hi>Mannerlie Margerie.</hi> Thus much to answer your former demaund concerning my wife, whether she were a widdow or a mayd: by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances wherof, you may perceiue she was a maid, although a very old one, and yet not so far spent in yeeres but she was able to play a youthfull trick.

For besides that she had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of her nayles, which she imployed many times about my face, she could likewise handle a payre of bellowes about my pate, a payre of tonges a thwart my shins, a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand sometimes should flye at my head, a ladle full of scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding liquour other-whiles in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Richard</hi> hauing thus discoursed the whole course of hys life, of his lyking, of his loue, of his pleasure, of his paine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the subiect of the matter were scarce worth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet considering the place whether we were going, it kept a fitte <hi>Decorum</hi> with the iourny we had in hande: and as the tale it selfe was tedious, so by this time we were ouer passed a long and wearisome way: the best commoditie, the tract was large and spacious, and still discended downe a Hill into the bothome of a Ualley, glooming and melancholy to behold, where we might espie one with a Waxe Candle lighted in his hand, who was walking by himselfe, prying and tooting in euery corner, and many times stumbling, and ready to fall where the way was plaine and smooth, that we tooke him to be some blind man that had lost his way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at we began to wonder what he shold doo with candle light, that could not s√©e to guide his steppes at high noone dayes. But we keeping on our way, were drawn so neere him that we might perceiue he had the vse of his eyes, yet hee neuer perceiued vs, till I saluted him, and bade him God speede. Whereat he suddainly started, as if he had b√©ene halfe in a fright, but when he had awhile taken the gaze on vs, hee demaunded of vs how farre we had come that way. I tolde him that we were come from Heauen, and that we were going to seeke out the place of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> desiring hym that if he were acquainted in those quarters, that he would direct vs the ready way to goe thither.</p>
            <p>Alas Gentlemen (said he) that is the place that I haue

b√©ene s√©eking for this long Moneth together, and I thinke there is no corner betweene thys and Hell that I haue lefte vnsearched: and were it not for thys holy Candle, whose vertue is able to defend me from the inchauntment of anie spirit or deuill, I would thinke I were <hi>Goblyn</hi> lead, I haue wandered so farre about, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>uermore hitting into daungerous high wayes that leadeth to Hell, and coulde neuer finde out the path that should bring me to Purgatory.</p>
            <p>Truly my freend (said I) if I be not deceiued, the lyght which you carry in your hand (wherin you repose your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test confidence) is the very meane of your mistaking, &amp; hath so much dimmed your sight and dazeled your eyes, that you cannot see the right way, but makes you thus to run stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling about, and to wander to and fro, that you your selfe knowes not whether, I would wish you therefore to leaue it, and you shall see so much the better howe to direct your steps. What said he, would you haue mee leaue my holy Candle, marry God and good S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> blesse me out of that mind: but if you be of that Religion, I would be sorry to tarrie in your company, vnlesse I might induce you by perswasion to thinke more reuerently of holy things.</p>
            <p>Truely (sayde I) a lyttle inducement shal suffise to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me to any reasonable matter, and good counsell is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore to be embraced, but especially at this instant, my case being now as it is.</p>
            <p>Why then (said he) I will tell you a true tale, wherein you shall perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ue the wonderfull effect that Holy water hath in working against the deuill, and this it is. There was not not long since, a very proper young woman, that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of a fiend, who did so torment &amp; vexe her, that althou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But you shall s√©e now, there was a good honest holy Priest that was a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie,</hi> who beeing in place where thys Woman was,
<pb facs="tcp:3563:21"/>
and lyking her very well, did begin to pitty her case, and of meere deuotion prickt forward by a san<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ified loue, he deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with himselfe, how he might fully reclaime her to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Church: and hauing attempted many practises in vaine, and finding that neyther perswasion, charme, nor any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of coniuration, was able to remooue the wicked spyrite from her, his last helpe was, hee gaue her a glister of holie Water, the which hee had no sooner put vp into her bodie, but the deuil immediatly forsooke her, that she after became a most Catholique vessell, and was able to reason so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly in that Keligion, that but with a little blast of her back side, she wold haue made the proudest Protestant that stoode next her to stop his nose.</p>
            <p>An other like miracle I am able to protest of mine owne knowledge, and this is it. There was a Gentleman that is liuing at this present houre, whose name and dwelling place if I list I coulde deliuer: thys Gentleman had beene married full out tenne yeeres, during which space he neuer had issue, although both himselfe and his wife were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to haue chyldren. But it fell out that a holy Father a <hi>Iesuite</hi> was priuily harboured in thys Gentlemans house, who seeing the Gentlewoman to be a lusty and well lyking wench to beare chyldren, did minister vnto her the holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of extreme vnction, anoyling her partes of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with holy oyle, and laying the signe of the crosse ouer her as she lay on her bed, and thys Gentlewoman for three yeeres together that thys holy father lay in her house, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere a childe: and therfore most happy may those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thinke themselues, that doth retaine and foster such holie guestes nowe in these dangerous tymes, if it were but to haue theyr Wiues hallowed, and to be made holy vessels.</p>
            <p>But if I shoulde heere enlarge further, what miracles hath beene wrought, by <hi>Holie Water, Holy Candles, Holy Ashes, Holy Oyles, Holie Lambes,</hi> and many other holy Keliques, I knowe I shoulde minister so much contentment to your conceite, as the pleasure would make you hartily to laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3563:21"/>Syr sayde I, your myracles are strange, and they may be true, but yet I am of opinion, that for the casting out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelles, the name of God is of groater authoritie, than a whole tubbe full of holy water, and for a woman to be made fruitefull in children, is likewise the blessing of God, and I doo thinke that for the attaynment of any thing that is good, it is rather to be requested in the name of the Creator, then otherwise to be sought for, by the meanes of the creature.</p>
            <p>The other aunswered againe, but men that bee of your Religion, are not able to looke into theyr owne errors: for if they were not wilfully blinde, they should finde it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience, that hee that will looke to preuaile in hys sutes, shall sooner bee dispatched by the mediation of the Saincts, than if he presumed to preferre his cause to GOD himselfe, and should finde more grace by the meanes of the creature, then if he requested in the name of the Creator: and because I would bee glad to confirme you the better, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Syr (saide I) if the matter were worth the reasoning, I could easily aunswere your fond comparisons, but I am not disposed to argue of these matters, &amp; wil therfore let them rest with this conclusion, that God is God, and onely good, &amp; men are men, &amp; no man without fault, nor fr√©e from offence.
