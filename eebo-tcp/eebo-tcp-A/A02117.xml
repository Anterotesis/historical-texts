            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thys fearefull aspect did wonderfullie daunt mee, with doubt of some angry accident that might shortly betide me; And I had not paced many steppes, but directly in the path before me, there appeared a most grislie ghost wrapt vp in a sheete, his face onely discouered, with a penne vnder his eare, and holding a scrowle of written paper in his hande. I crosled the way of purpose to shunne him, but crosse as I could he was euer-more before mee, that passe I might not, vnlesse I should runne ouer him; I remembred my selfe how old Fathers were wont to say, that Spirits in such cases, had no power to speake to any man, vntill they were first spoken vnto, and therefore taking vnto me a constrained courage, I asked him what he was, &amp; what was his meaning

               <pb facs="tcp:3563:8"/>Courteous Syr, if a strangers boldnesse might not breed offence, I would request you to satisfie mee but in this one demaund, I am (as you may perceiue) vnacquainted in this place, hauing taken a tedious and painfull trauell, and being now arriued, would be glad to vnderstand the successe of my iourney, and I haue walked too &amp; fro héere this long hower, and in all this space I could neuer see any one passe either in or out, nor the gate so much as opened, which seemeth strange vnto mée, considering the multitude which doo frequent the place, it makes me iealous, that all should not be well in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and to growe into suspition of I know not what.</p>
            <p>Truely my good friend (answered this graue sir) it should séeme you haue neuer bin a suter, that wold looke for so quick a dispatch, you haue walked vp and down (you say) héere this hower, and there be héere in this company, that haue trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as farre as you, and haue walkt vp and downe héere this moneth, peraduenture a yéere, perhaps more, and would bee glad if they might be dispatched yet, within a wéeke, a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or a moneth, yea, if it were somwhat more, they would be glad euen then to come to an end of their sutes, you must (Syr) therefore be contented to stay your time, &amp; to take your fortune, and thinke you came hether in a very happy houre, if you be dispatched in a quarter of a yéere. Your news sir (said I) doth not a little make me wonder, but if without offence I might but deale thus much farther with you, what might be the cause I beséech you, that there is no more regard to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching of poore suters, that haue laboured &amp; tyred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues many wayes in hope to haue héere a spéedy release, aswel for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> redresse of their sustained wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, as also to be rewarded as they shalbe found worthy by desart? for as it is supposed, this is the very place where Justice &amp; right is most duely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, &amp; therfore is accounted the only place of comfort: but can there be any greater wrong, than for a man to be so long deferred from his right? or may there be a more discomfort, than when a man shall neuer hope to haue end of his sutes?</p>
            <p>My good friend (answered the other againe) although you haue said no more than is truth: but yet something for your better satis-faction, your consideration must haue some refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:3563:8"/>
to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time, for one of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest matters that doth hinder the forwarding of sutes at this instant, ouer it hath béene in times past, is this, in briefe to be spoken, the wonderfull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of great importance, and the continuall busines that S. <hi>Peter</hi> is dayly troubled withall.</p>
            <p>What I pray sir (sayd I) is S. <hi>Peter</hi> more troubled with businesse now, than in times past he hath béene?</p>
            <p>O sir (said the other) you néede not doubt of that, &amp; there is great reason for it, that it can not otherwise be, he hath so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affaires to run through, that it is almost thought impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how he should execute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all: for first, he is Knight Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter héere of heauen gates, a place I warrant you of no lesse charge than trouble: then, he is constituted the Prince of the Apostles, &amp; confirmed in that authority by all the Popes, for this three or foure hundreth ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>re, so that al the rest of the Apostles can doo nothing without his allowance, and whatsoeuer he dooth they cannot recall: then, he is the Popes Factor, &amp; hath the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; determining of all causes for him, and hath lately bin more troubled with his brablements, for the holding vp of S. <hi>Peters</hi> chayre, than with all the Kings &amp; Princes again in Christendom: fourthly, he is the Master of the Requests, chosen by the papists to present their prayers to God, and they ply him euery day with moe pelting peti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ons, than his leysure will permit to looke ouer in a moneth after: these &amp; so many other matters hee hath still to looke into, that if he had sixe able bodies, they were all too little to run through his other affayres.</p>
            <p>Why (saide I) this is a pitteous case, that hauing such infinite busines, as I perceiue by your spceches, that he hath not some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants to helpe him, &amp; that so many troubles should not lye all on one mans necke.</p>
            <p>Well (said he) this is your opinion, you haue gyuen your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, but haue you not learned, <hi>Quod supra nos, nihil ad nos:</hi> it is not for you &amp; me to say what is beho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>These spéeches ended, giuing him great thankes for his curtesie, I returned againe to my two Companions, <hi>Veluet breeches</hi> and <hi>Cloth breeches,</hi> to whom I imparted all my

            <p>The next morning something early, S.

S. <hi>Peter</hi> hauing nowe seated himselfe, order was taken that euery suter shoulde successiuely bee heard, he that had remayned longest to be first called, and so to procéede to the second in due course accordingly. I and my two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were the latest that were there arriued, and therefore the last to be dispatched: the rest were examined by one and one, and that in such seuere and straight manner, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst euery ten, there were scarce one admitted to haue entrance into heauen, the Articles that were obiected against them, were too many in this place to bee rehearsed, but one thing I noted well, which was, there were some that shewed him the Popes Pasport, sealed with lead vnder his priuie Sygnet, but Jesus how S. <hi>Peter</hi> did be soole them, to shewe him such a writing, being not confirmed vnder the handes of the foure <hi>Euangelists,</hi> he commaunded them presently to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde and to come no more in his sight.</p>

            <p>As <hi>Veluet breeches</hi> had ended these words, there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come by, diuers Princes that had raigned Kinges of <hi>England,</hi> all of them mounted vpon great Horsses, and had béene abroade vppon the gréene running at the King: the which Princes being espyed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he called vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, requesting them a little to stay: and then poynting to <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet breeches,</hi> he demaunded if any of them did knowe hym, or any of hys name remaining in <hi>Englande,</hi> in the tyme of theyr raignes and gouernments? But they denayed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that euer they had seene hym, or euer known any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of English byrth that was of his name.</p>
            <p>Amongst this royall troupe, was King <hi>Henry</hi> the thyrd,

and he confidently protested, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in the time of his raigne, there was no such person to be found, for said hee, I sent one of my seruants to buy me a payre of hose, and hee returned againe with a payre that was but of sixe shillinges and eyght pence the price: wherewith I being displeased, folde him that I would haue had hym bestowed a marke of a payre, but hee said there were none such to be gotte. But as for the other <hi>Cloth breeches</hi> that standeth by hym, I know him very wel by his lookes, he dooth so much resemble his auncesters, and hath the very liuely picture of his Predecessours, the which were very honest plaine dealing men, without any manner of falshood or deceite.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> thanked them of their paines, and thus the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces departed, who beeing gone, S. <hi>Peter</hi> saide: You haue heard Ma. <hi>Veluet breeches</hi> what hath passed, but yet because you haue auouched your selfe to be a Gentleman, you shall haue thys fauour, we will examine some other of later time, who peraduenture may better call you to remembraunce. There stoode a Messenger by, whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> willed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to goe fetch hym some <hi>Englishman,</hi> that was but of some tenne or twenty yéeres residence in the place, charging hym to goe with spéede, and to make a quicke returne. The Messenger met with a company that were newe come out of a Tennis courte, amongst whom was a Mearcer, that within these tenne yéeres had dwelt in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> hym the Messenger brought to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who demaunded of him, if he did know a Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> called by the name of Ma. <hi>Veluet breeches.</hi> Yea marry sayde the Mearcer, I know him to my cost, for thys is he that standes by me, and heere I auouch it before his face that hee is no Gentleman, but a proude dissembler, and a cosoning counterfeite: which if it shal please you to giue me leaue, I will proue before this holy companie. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> aunswered, we doo not onelie giue you leaue, but also doe straightly commaunde you to speáke a truth, and withall, to speake no more then is truth, what you are able to charge him withall, and howe you are able to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>About fourteene or fifteene yéeres since, when I kept a shop in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> following there my trade, this counterfet Gentleman, being consorted with another of his owne pitch, a byrde of the same feather, although in times past, his onely samiliaritie was but with Dukes, Earles, Lordes, and such other worthy personages, yet at this day an ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and conuersant with euery skypiacke, and himselfe of base condition and a common Cosoner, his name called <hi>Silke stockings.</hi> These two copesmates, <hi>Veluet breeches</hi> and <hi>Silke stockings</hi> changing theyr names, and because I will not be offensiue to other Gentlemen, that peraduenture be of the same name which they then tooke to themselues, I will call <hi>Veluet breeches</hi> maister <hi>White,</hi> and <hi>Silke stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> he shall be maister <hi>Black,</hi> these two counterfeite Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, maister <hi>White</hi> and maister <hi>Black,</hi> prouiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of Lodgings, Maister <hi>White</hi> as it might be in <hi>Graties streete,</hi> in a house where no body knewe him, and Maister <hi>Blacke</hi> in <hi>Fanchurch streete,</hi> fast by where he found as little acquaintance.

            <p>Héere was now a Maister and a man well met, for the Maister meant to vse his man but to serue his turne for a poynt of cosonage, and the man meant to vse his Maister, til he might finde oportunity, to runne away with his purse or some other of his apparrell, as he had doone before with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. But according to appointment, in the Morning trusty <hi>Roger</hi> came, and was receiued of hys Maister, who now with his man at hys héeles, frequented his fréend Ma. <hi>Blacks</hi> Chamber for a day or two, and the one of them could not be without the others companie, but maister <hi>Black</hi> must dyne with maister <hi>White</hi> at his Chamber, and Ma. <hi>White</hi> must suppe wyth maister <hi>Blacke</hi> in his Chamber: but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell was, maister <hi>White</hi> with his seruaunt attending of hym, walking into <hi>Cheapside,</hi> and lighting into my shoppe, demaunded of my seruaunts where their Maister was, they told him that I was within, &amp; that if it pleased him to haue any thing with me, they would call me.

            <p>I hearing his smooth spéeches deliuered vnder pretence of honesty, and séeming otherwise, both in the show of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell and the dutifull attendance of his man, that hee had béene (indéede) some Gentleman of reputation and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coning, desirous so much the rather to win such a customer, I tolde him that I woulde not onely fitte him with as good stuffe as any man in <hi>London</hi> should shew hym, but also in the price I would vse him with such reason, as in any other place they were able to affoorde him: the which promise (in very déede) I meant faithfully to performe.</p>
            <p>Heere-withall, he drew a paper foorth of his pocket, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he began to reade: Item for my <hi>Lord,</hi> two yardes and a halfe of Blacke veluet, and two yardes and a halfe of Kusset veluet, for two payre of Hose, with three yards and a halfe of Black sattine, and as much of Kusset for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude he brought me out so many Items, that the prices of the wares amounted to 50. and od pounds, the which when I had sorted him out, he began to find fault that they were too high rated, praying me to sette my lowest

price, for that he meant to pay ready money, and therefore if I would not be reasonable, hee must be driuen to séeke some other shoppe. I very loath to driue him away, pitcht him a price so reasonable, as in truth I was not able better cheape to affoord them: but hys mind being onely sette vppon coso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, told me he durst not aduenture to gyue so much mony, and thus away he went.</p>
            <p>Within an houre after, hauing sent away his man, which of purpose he had doone, he returned againe, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in my shop, he asked me if I would abate no money in my stuffe: I thinking hee had béene some other where to cheapen, told him I had rated them so reasonably, as I was able to affoord them: and that I was sure, in anie shoppe where he had since béene, he had not found the like wares for the like price.</p>
            <p>Nay truelie, (sayde hee) I haue not beene in any other place to cheapen any such stuffe, but yet since I left your house I haue disbursed fortie poundes in other thinges, that I haue sent to my Lodging by my man: but I sée you are hard, and yet sith I haue dealt thus farre with you, I will not forsake you, come therefore and cutte me of the parcels. The which accordingly I did, and laying them together, hée desired me to cast the totall summe, the which as before I haue sayd, amounted to fifty and od pounds.</p>
            <p>Syr, (sayd hée) I must craue to borrow one of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, to helpe me home with thys stuffe, and hee shall bring you your money: I haue sent mine owne man about busines, and haue no body heere nowe to helpe mee.

            <p>And thus willing one of my men to take vp the stuffe and follow him, I deliuered him a note what mony he was to receiue. Together they goe, til they came to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in <hi>Graties streete,</hi> where they found hys man remaining, who (indeed) was somewhat perplexed in hys mind, because there was nothing there of hys Maisters, that was woorth the carrying away, vnlesse he should haue taken th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Maister <hi>White</hi> with that séemed as though he began to be angry, and willed his man presently to hast to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to will him withall speede, to bring away the two hundred pounds y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he was to receiue, or at the least to bring one of them with hym immediatly, for that hee was to pay the greatest part of it to one that staied in hys Chamber for it. Away went hys man, and in the meane time Ma. <hi>White</hi> entertained my man in this manner. He asked him if he had any acquaintance with some Goldsmith in the row that was his freend, and would vse him well in the buying of a Chaine and a payre of Bracelets, and not to exact too much of him for the fashion. My man told hym, that he was well acquainted with two or thrée that woulde deale very reasonably wyth hym.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:3563:17"/>
and that makes women when they be once marryed, to play their husbands such a cast, that they shall not knowe their own children: but if your loue be no such loue <hi>Richard,</hi> you shal not finde me vnkinde.

The good old woman her Mother, who had béen euer chary of the louely Chickin her daughter, and euen at the very instant when we were ready to goe to Church, shée was scooling of her with this exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margery,</hi> (sayd the) the day is nowe come for the which you haue so much longed after, it is twenty yéeres agoe since you first wished for a Husband, and byr Lady daughter you were then seauentéene or eyghteene yéeres of age, so that at this present you want not aboue two or thrée of forty: nowe if wit went by yéeres, you are olde enough to be wise, but I being your Mother, besides my many yéeres which might aduaunce my skill, so I haue buried foure seueral husbands, (the heauens be praised for it) which hath so much the more confirmed my experience in the dispositions of men, and can the better iudge of their naturall inclinations: and by all that I haue gathered by mine owne proofe and practise, I haue found it still by tryall, that the fantasies of men, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore best fitted with the follies of women. But leauing generalities, and to come to so much as concerneth but thy selfe, that art now to be married to a husband, who in respect of his age thou mightest be his Mother: and couldest thou now but consider, what a comfort it is for an olde Woman, to be louingly embraced by a you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man, O daughter daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thy mothers mouth begins to water, but with the verie imagination to thinke of the pleasure, and therefore happie maiest thou deeme thy selfe, that art so likely to enioy it.</p>
            <p>But héere is now a great péece of discretion to be vsed, for as age conceiueth such contentment with the societie of fresh and pleasant youth, so youth will quickly fall a loathing
<pb facs="tcp:3563:18"/>
of cold and crooked age, if the parties be not wise to enforce that by arte, that they are otherwise denaied by nature: which is, to shew a youthfull disposed minde, how farre so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> they be spent in yéeres: for it is a tyred Iade that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cry weehee, and a sorry Mare that cannot wag her taile. Thou art nowe to consider the inequalitie of the yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thy selfe and thy husbande, and therefore a little to whet him on to make him to like of thée the better, it shal not be amisse for thee to shew some youthfull conceite, especially being thy bridall day, it is tollerable for thée a little to play the wanton.</p>
            <p>I can tell thée daughter, men are well pleased to sée theyr Wiues youthfully gyuen, and there is nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth more delight them, then to sée them wantonly disposed: and thys is the meane to winne your husbands lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ng, and to drawe him to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> appetite, which your many yeeres might quenche: remember therefore what I haue told you, and fayle not for your aduantage, to shew some youthfull tricke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margery</hi> making a mannerly curtsie, said: Yes forsooth Mother, I will remember all that you haue told me.</p>
            <p>By this time all things being prepared, to Church we went, where the Priest hauing once doone his office, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe, and were accompanied with our neighbours and freendes that went home to dinner with vs: for whom there was prouided Fyrmentie and Minced Pyes, besides other good meate both roste and sodde: the which being all ready, <hi>Margery</hi> was placed at the vpper end, between two of the most substantiall honest men, according to the custome of the Parrish, and my selfe likewise, (as the manner was) did waite that day at the Table, with a napkin hanging on my shoulder.</p>
            <p>But O what a comfort it was vnto me, to sée how dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>Margery</hi> fedde of euery dish that came neere her, and how lustily she laid about her for her victuales And (thought I) if it be true as some will say, that a good féeding Horse will goe through with his labour, then I warrant if I gyue <hi>Margery</hi> her meate, I neede not feare to ryde her where I

lyst. But Dinner beeing almost at an ende, and the Cake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breade and Chéese ready to be sette on the Table, the good old Woman her Mother, who had likewise beene very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie that day in taking paynes to fill the pottes, and to carrie away emptie dishes, beganne to cheere vppe the companie, bidding them welcome, and telling them she was sorry there was no better chéere for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margery</hi> presently vpon the sight of her Mother bethought herselfe what she had to doo, and calling now to minde what lesson she had gyuen her, and howe shee had willed her that day to showe some youthfull tricke, thereby to purchase the fauour of her husband, and picking out at that very instant a fitte opportunity to performe it, she called to her Mother in thys youthfull manner, <hi>Munna, vppe and cacke.</hi> The olde Woman hearing her Daughter, sayd: Why how now <hi>Margerie?</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Then speaking to the company that safe by, she sayde: I pray you beare with my Daughters childishnes, for I know it is the Firmentie that dooth so much anoy her, for euen from her very infancie, if she had taken any spoone meate, she was still troubled in the bottome of her back-side with a great ventositie.</p>
            <p>The neighbours séeing the clenlinesse of the wench, did euer after that call her by the name of <hi>Mannerlie Margerie.</hi> Thus much to answer your former demaund concerning my wife, whether she were a widdow or a mayd: by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances wherof, you may perceiue she was a maid, although a very old one, and yet not so far spent in yeeres but she was able to play a youthfull trick. And now for the rest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but the tragedy of mine own mis-fortune: to signify the matter at large, would be tedious for you to heare, &amp; fearefull for me to declare, the very memory wherof were enough to make me tremble, but that I know I am farre enough from her that was the minister of my woe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3563:19"/>Let thys suffise, within a very fewe Monethes after I was married, <hi>Margery</hi> beganne to grow ielous, for if shee had once béene thirsty, and that I wanted money to sende to the Ale-house, she wold tell me that I spent a way my thrift amongst some other young Queanes: heere began our first falling out, and to set forward the matter, there dwelt at the very next house by me, a Tayler, who had a wife y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was sure once a day to measure the breadth of her husbands shoulders with his owne mete-yard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margery</hi> and this Taylors wife grew to be acquainted, and amongst other conclusions it was agréed betwéen them, that to preuent diseases, and to preserue them in health, they would euery morning next their harts, take a phisical dyet, which was, a full quarte of the quintinsence drawne from an Ale-tub, warmed by the fire, with a grated Nutmeg, halfe a yarde of Black-pudding rosted on a grydyron, a quantitle of salte, with a measure of fine Wheate-flower, first made into paste, and after baked in a loafe of breade: these ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, after they had incorporated altogether, they would afterwards lightly fast till noone. And they founde such a commoditie in vsing this Medicine, that if the Tayler and I had not euery morning giuen them mony to pay for the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, it had not beene good for vs to haue come that day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their sights: for the Taylors wife, shee could handle a mete-yard or a cudgel passing nimbly, but <hi>Margery</hi> had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the practise of all manner of weapons. For besides that she had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of her nayles, which she imployed many times about my face, she could likewise handle a payre of bellowes about my pate, a payre of tonges a thwart my shins, a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand sometimes should flye at my head, a ladle full of scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding liquour other-whiles in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In the ende, deuising with my selfe a remedy for these mischieues, I found the meanes to be made the <hi>Cunstable,</hi>

But within a day or two, it was my fortune to hit on a pot of strong Ale, which shee had sette vp in a corner for her owne drinking, and I (béeing thirsty) gaue it such a soupe, that I left very little behind. The which afterwarde when she came to séeke for, and founde her store so pittisullie impaired, against my comming home at night, she prouided her selfe of a waster, and I was no sooner entred the doores, but foorth she comes with her cudgell in her hand, and wyth such a terrible countenaunce, that were able to affright anie man that should behold it.</p>

               <hi>Richard,</hi> sayd shée, I had thought you would neuer haue gyuen me occasion to be ielous of you, but now I sée you loue a cuppe of strong Ale better then you loue me, and do you not thinke then that I haue great reason to be displeased wyth your vnkindnes towards me, and to beate out that lacke of loue that dooth make you so lightly to regard me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margery,</hi> sayd I, take héede what you doo, for you know that I am her Maiesties Officer, and heere I charge you in the Quéenes name, that you holde your handes.

No sir no, for nowe you haue deserued double punishment: first, you being an Officer if you offer wrong, your punishment must be so much the more gréeuous, and is it not meere iniustice to take that which was not prouided for you: next, you haue deserued to be well punished, for the little reuerence you haue vsed in the execution of your office: commaunding me in the Queenes name to hold my handes with your cap on your head, nor vsing any other duty or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence: but Matster <hi>Cunstable,</hi> I will teach you howe to vse an Office, and with that she let flye at my heade, at my shoulders, at my armes, and still she would cry, remember heereafter how you doo your Office, remember your duty to the Queene, remember when you commaund in her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties name, that you put off your cap, and doo it with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:

               <hi>Richard</hi> hauing thus discoursed the whole course of hys life, of his lyking, of his loue, of his pleasure, of his paine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the subiect of the matter were scarce worth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet considering the place whether we were going, it kept a fitte <hi>Decorum</hi> with the iourny we had in hande: and as the tale it selfe was tedious, so by this time we were ouer passed a long and wearisome way: the best commoditie, the tract was large and spacious, and still discended downe a Hill into the bothome of a Ualley, glooming and melancholy to behold, where we might espie one with a Waxe Candle lighted in his hand, who was walking by himselfe, prying and tooting in euery corner, and many times stumbling, and ready to fall where the way was plaine and smooth, that we tooke him to be some blind man that had lost his way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at we began to wonder what he shold doo with candle light, that could not sée to guide his steppes at high noone dayes. But we keeping on our way, were drawn so neere him that we might perceiue he had the vse of his eyes, yet hee neuer perceiued vs, till I saluted him, and bade him God speede. Whereat he suddainly started, as if he had béene halfe in a fright, but when he had awhile taken the gaze on vs, hee demaunded of vs how farre we had come that way. I tolde him that we were come from Heauen, and that we were going to seeke out the place of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> desiring hym that if he were acquainted in those quarters, that he would direct vs the ready way to goe thither.</p>
            <p>Alas Gentlemen (said he) that is the place that I haue
<pb facs="tcp:3563:20"/>
béene séeking for this long Moneth together, and I thinke there is no corner betweene thys and Hell that I haue lefte vnsearched: and were it not for thys holy Candle, whose vertue is able to defend me from the inchauntment of anie spirit or deuill, I would thinke I were <hi>Goblyn</hi> lead, I haue wandered so farre about, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uermore hitting into daungerous high wayes that leadeth to Hell, and coulde neuer finde out the path that should bring me to Purgatory.</p>
            <p>Truly my freend (said I) if I be not deceiued, the lyght which you carry in your hand (wherin you repose your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test confidence) is the very meane of your mistaking, &amp; hath so much dimmed your sight and dazeled your eyes, that you cannot see the right way, but makes you thus to run stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling about, and to wander to and fro, that you your selfe knowes not whether, I would wish you therefore to leaue it, and you shall see so much the better howe to direct your steps. What said he, would you haue mee leaue my holy Candle, marry God and good S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> blesse me out of that mind: but if you be of that Religion, I would be sorry to tarrie in your company, vnlesse I might induce you by perswasion to thinke more reuerently of holy things.</p>
            <p>Truely (sayde I) a lyttle inducement shal suffise to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me to any reasonable matter, and good counsell is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore to be embraced, but especially at this instant, my case being now as it is.</p>
            <p>Why then (said he) I will tell you a true tale, wherein you shall perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ue the wonderfull effect that Holy water hath in working against the deuill, and this it is. There was not not long since, a very proper young woman, that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of a fiend, who did so torment &amp; vexe her, that althou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>h she would not goe to any Sermons, nor would euer receiue the Communion, yet she would sometimes goe to Church, and say her <hi>Pater noster</hi> in English, and now and then eate flesh on Fridaies, and would commit many other heresies, which thys deuill tempted and led her to doe. But you shall sée now, there was a good honest holy Priest that was a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie,</hi> who beeing in place where thys Woman was,
<pb facs="tcp:3563:21"/>
and lyking her very well, did begin to pitty her case, and of meere deuotion prickt forward by a san<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ified loue, he deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with himselfe, how he might fully reclaime her to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Church: and hauing attempted many practises in vaine, and finding that neyther perswasion, charme, nor any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of coniuration, was able to remooue the wicked spyrite from her, his last helpe was, hee gaue her a glister of holie Water, the which hee had no sooner put vp into her bodie, but the deuil immediatly forsooke her, that she after became a most Catholique vessell, and was able to reason so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly in that Keligion, that but with a little blast of her back side, she wold haue made the proudest Protestant that stoode next her to stop his nose.</p>
            <p>An other like miracle I am able to protest of mine owne knowledge, and this is it. There was a Gentleman that is liuing at this present houre, whose name and dwelling place if I list I coulde deliuer: thys Gentleman had beene married full out tenne yeeres, during which space he neuer had issue, although both himselfe and his wife were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to haue chyldren. But it fell out that a holy Father a <hi>Iesuite</hi> was priuily harboured in thys Gentlemans house, who seeing the Gentlewoman to be a lusty and well lyking wench to beare chyldren, did minister vnto her the holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of extreme vnction, anoyling her partes of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with holy oyle, and laying the signe of the crosse ouer her as she lay on her bed, and thys Gentlewoman for three yeeres together that thys holy father lay in her house, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere a childe: and therfore most happy may those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thinke themselues, that doth retaine and foster such holie guestes nowe in these dangerous tymes, if it were but to haue theyr Wiues hallowed, and to be made holy vessels.</p>
            <p>But if I shoulde heere enlarge further, what miracles hath beene wrought, by <hi>Holie Water, Holy Candles, Holy Ashes, Holy Oyles, Holie Lambes,</hi> and many other holy Keliques, I knowe I shoulde minister so much contentment to your conceite, as the pleasure would make you hartily to laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3563:21"/>Syr sayde I, your myracles are strange, and they may be true, but yet I am of opinion, that for the casting out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelles, the name of God is of groater authoritie, than a whole tubbe full of holy water, and for a woman to be made fruitefull in children, is likewise the blessing of God, and I doo thinke that for the attaynment of any thing that is good, it is rather to be requested in the name of the Creator, then otherwise to be sought for, by the meanes of the creature.</p>
            <p>The other aunswered againe, but men that bee of your Religion, are not able to looke into theyr owne errors: for if they were not wilfully blinde, they should finde it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience, that hee that will looke to preuaile in hys sutes, shall sooner bee dispatched by the mediation of the Saincts, than if he presumed to preferre his cause to GOD himselfe, and should finde more grace by the meanes of the creature, then if he requested in the name of the Creator: and because I would bee glad to confirme you the better, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

You are nowe to preferre thys sute: what, will you goe to the Prince himselfe? (who in this place representeth God) why you shall attende a longe while before you shall come to his presence, and then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be milde, affable, gracious, and full of clemencie, and in déede with as many royall vertues as appertayneth to a godly Prince, yet he will turne you of to some one graue Counsailer, or some other great personage that is about him, to looke into your cause and to consider of it: (who in this place dooth represent the holy Saincts, which must bee your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Syr (saide I) if the matter were worth the reasoning, I could easily aunswere your fond comparisons, but I am not disposed to argue of these matters, &amp; wil therfore let them rest with this conclusion, that God is God, and onely good, &amp; men are men, &amp; no man without fault, nor frée from offence. This is very true (answered <hi>Richard</hi>) for the <hi>Vicar</hi> of our parish in a Sermon that he made on Midlent Sunday, did speake so much in Latine and sayde, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Wée that stoode by, and were more mindfull to see an end of our trauailes then disposed to prolong the time in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: I asked of the Miller if he did knowe where abouts the place of Purgatory was, or if he could giue vs any direction which way we myght gette thither, he answered thus.</p>

            <p>The persons that were the first founders of the place, were not perfectly sighted, but like as the Owle which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide the light of the Sunne, flyeth euermore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night, so those men, not able to endure that excellent brightnesse which is the onely true light to euery perfect vnderstanding, framing all theyr platformes in obscuritie and darknesse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other idle inuentions, woulde needes take vppon them the building of Purgatorie. The place where they had seated it, was so obscured with such fogges and filthy mystes, that no man that had the perfect vse of hys wittes,

            <p>Why then sayd I (to our companion that stoode by with hys Candle,) I perceiue you had some reason to bring light with you when you came to séeke Purgatory, sith the place is so darke and so daintie to be found.

            <p>Hée breaking out into sundry passions, some-times ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging against the Myller, saying that he was but an ignorant and a lying Heretique: then calling to his memory the long tyme he had spent in seeking of Purgatory, hee beganne as vehemently to rayle against the Pope, and as bitterly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime against hys <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Seminaries,</hi> that had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to instruct hym in the high way to Heauen, and directlie sent him the verie next way to Hell.</p>

            <p>Then was there brought foorth a most stately Chayre, which was prepared of purpose, in which Chayre <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Pryde</hi> hauing placed the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> olde <hi>Ignorance</hi> and young <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> (the one blind, the other froward,) taking it vpon theyr shoulders, as if the Pope himselfe were carried in his <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> and then a rich &amp; sumptuous Canapie béeing spred ouer him, and borne by foure supporters, which were, <hi>Idolatry, Hipocrisie, Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> thus in this pompious manner (beeing placed in the Procession next <hi>Lucifer</hi> himselfe) they returned to Hell, whose gates I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be so large and spacious, that a Princes Army though it were martialed in any proportion of battayle, with Fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Troupes and Winges, might well haue marched in without any manner of dysorder. And although the inner roomes did so excéede in greatnes, that it passeth humaine reason to conceiue of them aright, yet he that should behold the aboundance of people that resorte thether daily, and the infinite number that are there to be séene flocking in euerie corner therof, wold more wonder to thinke what place could so containe them.</p>
            <p>Béeing thus come into Hell, they went to the Chappel, where Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> the first founder of <hi>Trasubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was ready to say <hi>Masse,</hi> the which béeing ended, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> (who can in no wise endure the deferring of matters

            </p>
