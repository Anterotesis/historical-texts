            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is aſſented &amp; accorded, for the good governement of the Commons, that no man be put to anſwer, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment before Iuſtices, or thing of Record, by due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and writt originall, according to the ould law of the land; And if any thing be done from henceforth to the contrary; it ſhalbe voyd in law &amp; holden for error; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is worthy the nothing, that it is ſayd <hi>according to the old lawes of England.</hi>

Edward Cooke,</hi> in his argument made in <hi>Slades</hi> Caſe, ſayd well, that in criminall cauſes (<hi>iuramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria cauſa eſt inventio diaboli ad detrudendum animas misero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in infernum</hi>) according to whoſe ſaying it appeareth, that when thoſe oathes were uſed by the parties accuſed, by the border lawes between England &amp; Scotland, thoſe oathes did bring no furtherance to the truth, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt perjury every day; as was confeſſed by all that knewe the practiſe there: and therefore that manner of triall was ſoone rejected.</p>
               <p>And to proue it againſt Iuſtice and good equity, he ſayd that this oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> to force a man in a criminall cauſe to accuſe himſelfe, was (he thought) directly againſt the rule of the law of God. For it is ſayd in <hi>Deut. cap. 19. 15.</hi> that one witnes ſhall not ariſe againſt a man for any treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas, or for any ſin, or for any fault that he offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in; but at the mouth of two witneſſes or .3. witneſſes shall the matter be eſtabliſhed. Which rule is confirmed under the Goſpell, as appeareth <hi>Math: 18.16. 2. Cor. 13.1.</hi> where it is ſayd, In the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall every word ſtand; and Chriſt ſayd to the woman accused of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, <hi>where be thine accuſers? &amp;c.</hi> But without any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or accuſer to eſtabliſh the matter, upon the inforced oath of the partie, hath no coherence with the rule of Gods law, which ſhould be a direction to all Chriſtian
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2892:9"/>
Princes in making of their lawes, we being now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God the Iewes being cut of; the Iudgments being now the iudgments of God, and not of men alone.</p>
               <p>But here may be objected, that by the lawes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land one witnes is ſufficient: to which he anſwered, that the Iurors being all ſworne to trie the particuler matter in <hi>fact,</hi> wherewith the party defendant is charged, may well ſupplie the want of one witnes, being 12 perſons in different, without any affinitie to either partie, who bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowe the witneſſes then the Iudge, and may perhaps know the cauſe in queſtion, aſwell as the witnes: which kinde of triall is ſo behouefull for the ſubjectes, as it may prevent much wrong and oppreſſion from high authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if the Iurors be iuſt &amp; faithfull perſons, as they ought to be; and their verdit alſo may be redreſſed by attaint, if they ſhould doe wrong therein: which writts of <hi>attaint,</hi> and <hi>error,</hi> are parte of the ſubjectes inheritance.</p>
               <p>Alſo this oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> hath no coherence with the law of nature. For, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>natura eſt conſervatrix ſui,</hi> as is ſayd in <hi>40.

And where an oath ſhould be the end of ſtrife, this oath <hi>Ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio</hi> is often times the begining of ſtrife; yea it hath been ſo hatefull as ſome <hi>Martyrs</hi> haue written againſt it, as a bloudie law; and therefore not without juſt cauſe, that the whole eſtate aſſembled in Parliament in an. 25. <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> held it not to be agreeing with the rule of right and e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quity, and to be contrary to the lawes of England, and therfore revoked the ſayd ſtatute of <hi>2.

               <p>For the lawes in a common wealth are like the ſinewes in a naturall body, by which the hand, foote, and other partes of the body doe readily moue, by the direction of the head; but if the hand, or foote, be forced aboue the ſtrength of the ſinewe, it eyther taketh away the uſe of that parte, or els it maketh it a weake or halting member: ſo is it, if the lawes be ſtreyned againſt any part of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, aboue it right, and naturall ſtrength, it will make that parte weake, or halting: and therefore it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſayd in <hi>8.

they may inflict what puniſhment any three of them ſhal thinke meete in their diſcretions, and force men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch order as they ſhall make, by the parties bond, before any order made: and that their judgments, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees whatſoever, ſhould not be ſubject to any writt of <hi>Error, attaint,</hi> or <hi>appeale</hi>: and that they may deviſe meanes, at their owne diſcretion, for the triall and finding out of any the ſayd offences.

               <p>Only ſo much as came under his owne viewe, he ſaid, that, the laſt day of <hi>Eaſter terme,</hi> he moved at the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> barre, for 20. perſons, his <hi>Clients,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyre</hi>; wherof ſom, as they told him, were very poore, who were fined by the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners</hi> for not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at their dayes appoynted, many of them to <hi>30. pounds</hi> a peece, one only at ten, and all the reſt at twenty a peece, which was not <hi>ſalvo contenemento,</hi> according to the ſtatute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> cap. 14. And one client, being an houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder in Fleeteſtreete, named <hi>William Goulder,</hi> prayed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe for his hard &amp; cloſe impriſonment many dayes, with great Irons on him, by the <hi>Commiſsioners,</hi> upon ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition conceaved by ſome of the Commiſſioners, that ſome perſon was hid in his houſe; and was after freed without any conviction of his ſuppoſed offence. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſayd <hi>Nicholas Fuller</hi> did except againſt the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners,</hi> as not competent Iudges, in their owne cauſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2892:14"/>
of him and of his argument, made againſt them at the <hi>Kings bench</hi> barre, they threatned to ſett 500. pounds fine on him, and to impriſon him. And when (he finding their proceeding by the oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> to vary from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawes, which he had long tyme practiſed) he ſaid to them, it ſeemed to him, that he was in a new world, or other Common wealth: thereupon they threatned to impriſon him, if he ſpake one word more to the diſgrace of the <hi>Commiſsion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore he held it ſtrong, in his opinion (becauſe his Majeſties Commiſſion, which they terme <hi>High,</hi> is, by the true intent of the ſtatute, only a <hi>Commiſsion executorie,</hi> but for ſo long time onely as ſhall pleaſe the King, and is no ſetled court for continuance for ever, as they would haue it, comparing the authority thereof with the <hi>Kings bench,</hi> and preferring it aboue it) that, in all the partes and poynts aboue rehearſed, the <hi>Commiſsion</hi> is not of force in law, nor warranted by law, except ſome Act of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doe giue it life.</p>
               <p>And now touching the laſt and principall parte of his diviſion, viz, that no Act of Parliament doth giue life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to the <hi>Commiſsion Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> in the parts aboue menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, it is to be noted, that the Commiſſion is founded only upon the ſtatute of an. <hi>1. Eliz. cap. 1.</hi> and that this Act of an. <hi>1. Eliz.</hi> neyther doth, nor can giue life to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by any right conſtruction, in theſe partes aboue rehearſed, but contrarywiſe doth expreſly aboliſh their Iuriſdiction to impriſon ſubjectes, fyne them, and force them to accuſe themſelues, as repugnant to the <hi>Auncient Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction,</hi> which, by this Act, is reſtored to the Crowne: and he hoped to make that poynt ſo playne and apparant to all the hearers, that would atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2892:15"/>
regard it, as that they might be fully ſatisfied ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For, beſides the <hi>Booke Caſes,</hi> which he ment to put, in that poynt, to proue his aſſertion, he ſayd, that the title in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>an. 1. Eliz.</hi> the preamble of the Act, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter preceding the preamble in that Act, and the body of that Act, which giveth power to the Commiſſioners to execute the premiſſes (by colour wherof they challenge this great power to impriſon ſubjectes etc.) doe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, by their being rightly applyed, to condemne and overthrowe theſe poynts of the Commiſſion Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, before ſpoken of and rehearſed by him, as unlawfull, and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>The title is, <hi>an Act, reſtoring to the Crowne the auncient Iuriſdiction over the Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall eſtate, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing all forren Iuriſdiction, repugnant to the ſame.</hi> What the auncient Iuriſdiction over the Eccleſiaſticall and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſtate is, he hath ſufficiently before declared, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be that Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction (viz. <hi>Keyes</hi> or <hi>cenſures of the Church</hi>) which was lawfully vſed in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, before the ſtatute of <hi>2.

               </p>
               <p>And to make the meaning of the law-makers more apparant, that they allowed not, that any offences ſhould be tried by the parties owne oath, but by witneſſes; as in the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of this ſtatute of <hi>an. 1.

               </p>
               <p>By which words ſith it is playne, that no offence, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned or revived by that ſtatute, ſhould receaue triall, but by two witneſſes brought face to face; that they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to giue power, by any <hi>Commiſsion</hi> grounded upon that ſtatute, to haue the offences of the ſubjectes (which touch ſo deepe as <hi>Premunire, abiuration,</hi> and <hi>forfeiture of lands and goodes</hi>) ſhould be tried by the parties owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced oath, againſt his will, without any witnes or accuſer, as this Commiſſion limitts; and yet it is pretended to be grounded upon this ſtatute. And therfore it were a moſt violent conſtruction, and abſurd, that the generall words in this ſtatute, viz. <hi>to execute the premiſſes according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and effect of the letters patents,</hi> ſhould reviue that by an intendment, which was, by ſo playne wordes of all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie in Parliament, revoked and aboliſhed, as a moſt hatefull thing to the ſubjectes of England, and of which they ment to purge the Church and Eccleſiaſticall gover<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. For that were to make one parte of the ſtatute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the other, and to conſtrue the wordes of the law, indefinitely ſett downe, directly againſt the meaning of the law makers plainely expreſſed by wordes; which Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges never did, nor, as he hoped, ever would doe.</p>
               <p>And the title and preamble of the ſtatute doe further reſtrayne the overlarge conſtruction of thoſe generall wordes, <hi>to execute the premiſſes</hi>: becauſe the premiſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the auncient juriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall, purged from that temporall Iuriſdiction, as aboue, is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be reſtored onely over the Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall

Eliz.</hi> where the wordes of the ſtatute are, that <hi>every perſon and perſons who shall commit voluntarie and corrupt periurie, shall forfeit twentie poundes.</hi> And becauſe the preamble and matter precedent touched witneſſes only, therefore that penaltie is reſtreyned, by conſtruction, to charge witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes onely therwith, and not ſuch perſons as ſhall commit voluntary and corrupt periurie, in their owne caſes. And ſo upon the ſtatute of <hi>7. Edward. 6.</hi> againſt <hi>Receivers, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs,</hi> etc. although the wordes of that ſtatute extend gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to lay a penaltie of 6. ſhillings 8. pence for every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that receivours ſhall take unlawfully; yet becauſe the preamble of that ſtatute touched only the Kings officers, It is, in conſtruction, reſtrayned to take force againſt the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2892:17"/>
Kinges officers onely, and againſt none other receivers, or bayliffes.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this poynt of the expoſition of the wordes of the ſtatute, he did demaund, why the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſtruction of all ſtatutes is left to the Iudges of the law, but for this cauſe, for that they are, and alwayes haue been thought the moſt carefull, iudicious, and je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous preſervers of the lawes of England? And is it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that, to uphold the right of the lawes of England, the Iudges in ages paſt haue adviſedly conſtrued ſome wordes of divers ſtatutes contrary to the common ſence of the words of the ſtatute, to uphold the meaning of the common lawes of the Realme? as in the ſtatute of <hi>25. Ed. 3.</hi> where it is ſayd, that, <hi>non tenure</hi> of parcell ſhall abate the writt but for parcell; yet if by the writt an entier ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be demaunded, <hi>non tenure</hi> of parcell ſhall abate the whole writt. And where, by the ſtatute of <hi>Marlbridg ca. 4.</hi> it is prohibited, that no diſtreſſe ſhalbe driven out of the County where it is taken, yet, if one manour extend into two Counties, there the diſtreſſe may be drive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from one County into another Countie. And, upon the ſtatute of <hi>Prerogatiue,</hi> which toucheth the King, although the wordes be generall, that the King ſhall haue the cuſtodie of all the landes of his tenaunt where parte is holden in <hi>Capite,</hi> yet if part of the landes of his tenaunt doe deſcend to ſeverall heyres, on the parte of the Father, and on the parte of the Mother, there the King ſhall not haue all the landes of his tenaunt, during the minoritie of the heire; for that, in all these Caſes, the great regard of the rule and right of the common lawes doth controll the generall or common ſence of the wordes of thoſe ſtatutes.</p>
               <p>And why then ſhould this ſtatute receiue conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2892:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Iudges of the law, contrary to the rule of all other ſtatutes, to this effect, that by in intendment gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the generall wordes of the Act, <hi>according to the tenor of the ſay<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> letters Pa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ents,</hi> there might be erected, in this common wealth of England, a courſe of an arbitrarie governement at the diſcretion of the Commiſſioners, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the happie long continued goverment and courſe of the common lawes of the Realme, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> which if the ſtatute of <hi>24. Edw. 3.</hi> did ſo highly regard, as to make voyd Acts of Parliament contrary to the ſame, it would, a <hi>fortiori,</hi> make voyd all conſtruction of ſtatuts contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which haue no expreſſe wordes, but an intendement or conſtruction of words, with much violence to be wreſted to that end. And for ſuch as would make ſuch conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtatute, as that whatſoever ſhould be conteyned in the letters Pattents ſhould be as a law; he would haue them remember, that the <hi>King</hi> may make new letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for theſe matters (Eccleſiaſticall cauſes every day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſame in the penalties and manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) and that, if the letter of the ſtatute ſhould be puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the King may change the Commiſſioners every day, and make any perſons Commiſſioners, being naturall borne ſubjectes to the King, although not borne in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: which were againſt the meaning of the Act; which meaning of the Act is the life of the Act, and not the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Act.</p>
               <p>And, beſides thoſe former errors of the Commiſſion before remembred, he ſayd, that he did not ſee, how, by colour of the ſtatute of <hi>1. Eliz.</hi> which gaue power to the Commiſſioners <hi>to execute the premiſſes</hi> conteyned in that Act, they ſhould inlarge their Patent to enquire of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2892:18"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to other ſtatuts, made thirtie or fortie yeares, and more, after <hi>an. 1. Eliz.</hi> which then were not dreamed of, nor meant to be any part of the premiſſes conteyned in the ſayd ſtatute of <hi>anno. 1. Eliz.</hi> and of other civill and temporall thinges, for which if the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> court had held plea, a <hi>prohibition</hi> did lye at the common law, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtatute of <hi>24. Edw. 1. cap: 1.</hi> and <hi>22. Ed. 4. fol 20.</hi> and in <hi>13. Hen. 7: fol: 39. Brooke</hi> and <hi>Fitzh. fol. 43. 22. Hen. 8.</hi> becauſe, for the ſame thinges, redreſſe may be had at the common lawes: and in <hi>7. Hen. 8. fol. 181.</hi> the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the <hi>Convocation</hi> houſe, for medling againſt <hi>Doctor Standiſh</hi> for a temporall cauſe by him diſputed before the LL. of the Councell, were adiudged, by all the Iudges, to be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Premunire.</hi> But it wilbe objected, that uſe is the beſt expoſitor of the ſtatute: and then the continuance of this Commiſſion, ſince the ſtatute of <hi>1. Eliz.</hi> being aboue 40. yeares, will prevaile much; to which he anſwered, that long uſe, in a ſetled court, maketh it the law of the court; and the iudgments in one Court are not examinable in every other Court, or in any, but in the proper Court, by <hi>writt of error, falſe iudgement,</hi> or <hi>appeale:</hi> vnles the inferior Court meddle with that which is not within their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; and then in many caſes their iudgment is <hi>coram non Iudice,</hi> and ſo voyd.</p>
               <p>But this Eccleſiaſticall Commiſſion is but a <hi>Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on executorie,</hi> by the intent of the ſtatute of <hi>1. Eliz.</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long as ſhould pleaſe the Queene, or King, &amp; no ſetled Court: and was mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the firſt (as he thought) to haue continuance for a ſhort time, to ſtrengthen the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> againſt whoſe Ordination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Papiſts did at the firſt except. In which caſes of things done by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſions, whatſoever the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners doe, it is <hi>examinable</hi> in every Court where it ſhall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2892:18"/>
come in queſtion, at any time after; whether that they haue purſued their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion or authority, in due forme or no. For their Decrees and ſentences are not pleadable in law, as Iudgments in Courts of Record are: and the many yeares uſe of the Commiſſioners, eſpecially being Eccleſisſticall men for the moſt parte, who know not the lawes of the Realme, will giue no enforcement to their proceeding, if it be contrary to law.</p>
               <p>But as in this Commiſſion (touching cauſes of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire, Abiuration,</hi> and other Caſes where the <hi>forfeiture of landes and goods</hi> doe enſue) the Commiſſioners Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſay, they uſe not in theſe caſes to force any ſubject to accuſe themſelues, although the words of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion doe extend ſo farr; becauſe they ſee it apparantly contrary to law and right: ſo the Iudges may ſay the like, that, in other caſes of leſſe penaltie (to their knowledge) untill of late yeares, the Commisſioners uſed not either to force any to accuſe themſelues, or to impriſon them for refuſing ſo to doe. And he did further anſwer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the learning and difference which is taken in 44. <hi>Edw: 3. fol: 17.</hi> that albeit the allowance in <hi>Oier</hi> of ſome Commſſion may be of great force to giue ſtrength unto the ſame Commiſſion, yet the allowance, or toleration in ſome other Court of ſuch Commisſions many times (if it after appeare to be contrary to law) bindeth neither the right of the King, nor ſubjects, but that the Iudges of the law may judge thereof according to law.</p>
               <p>Vpon all which matters he did conclude, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Commisſion be of force to execute <hi>the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Iuriſdiction over the Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall eſtate</hi>; yet becauſe this Commisſion, and the proceedings of the Commisſioners, did much vary from the courſe of
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>

It is, in conſtruction, reſtrayned to take force againſt the the ould Common lawes of England, expreſſed in the ſtatute of <hi>42. Edw: 3. cap. 3.</hi> and from the <hi>auncient Iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Eccleſiaſticall</hi>; for that no pretended cuſtome, againſt thoſe ſtatutes which prohibite ſuch kind of proceeding, can be of force; and eſpecially for that the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>1. Eliz.</hi> did not giue life or ſtrength to the ſayd Commisſion, in thoſe parts ſo varying, but the contrary: therefore he did hold the proceeding of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Commisſioners againſt the ſubjectes, by force of the ſayd Commisſion, in theſe poyntes, to be voyd, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, according to the wordes of the ſayd ſtatute <hi>42. Edw. 3.</hi> and did humblie pray, that his <hi>Clients</hi> may be diſcharged from their <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> and the ſubjects freed from ſuch <hi>erroneous proceedings,</hi> too too heavie and burdenſome to them.</p>
