            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will appear to any
who ſhal read this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi>
that it was written
in the times of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical</hi>
Government, but
in the later and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
times thereof,
when the change of that Government was
in agitation, and in part effected. In which
reſpect I doubt not but the publiſhing of
<pb facs="tcp:114881:3"/>
this Diſcourſe at this preſent time may
ſeem unſeaſonable unto ſome, and yet it may
be thought by others to come out ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
enough for theſe following reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. To give warning to all thoſe that are
in Supreme Authority to have a care un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themſelves, and not to ſuffer any <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
and <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Spirits to grow amongſt
them; who grounding upon <hi>Calvins</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
both may, and will upon occaſion,
create new diſturbances.</p>
            <p>2. To preſerve the Dignity of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power, in what Perſon ſoever it be
placed, and fix his Perſon in his own
proper Orb, the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
brought down of late, to be
but one of the <hi>three Eſtates,</hi> and move
in the ſame Planetary Sphere with the
other two.</p>
            <p>3. To keep on foot the claim and Title
of the Clergy unto the Reputation, Rights,
and Priviledges of the <hi>Third Eſtate,</hi> which
doth of right belong unto them; and
which the Clergy have antiently enjoyed
<pb facs="tcp:114881:3"/>
in all, and to this day in moſt Chriſtian
Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>4. To ſhew unto the world, on whoſe
authority the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> built their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Doctrine, not only of curbing and
reſtraining the power of Princes, but alſo
of depoſing them from their Regal Dignity,
whenſoever they ſhall pleaſe to pretend cauſe
for it. For when the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were commanded by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
to give a reaſon of their proceedings againſt
their Queen, whom not long before they
had depoſed from the Regal Throne; they
juſtified themſelves by thoſe words of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
which I have choſen for the Argument
of this Diſcourſe. <hi>By the authority of</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
(as my Author hath it) <hi>they endeavoured
to prove, that the</hi> Popular Magiſtrates <hi>are
appointed and made to moderate and keep in
order the exceſs and unrulineſs of Kings; and
that it is lawful for them to put the Kings
that be evill and wicked into priſon, and alſo
to deprive them of their Kingdoms.</hi> If theſe
reaſons ſhall not prove the <hi>ſeaſonableneſs</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:114881:4"/>
this Adventure, I am the more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for my indiſcretion, the ſhame
whereof I muſt endure as well as I can.
This being ſaid in order to my <hi>juſtification,</hi>
I muſt add ſomewhat of the Book or <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>
it ſelf; in which the canvaſſing and
confuting of <hi>Calvins</hi> Grounds about the
<hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the <hi>Demarchi</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> hath forced me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many Quotations both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi>
which to the <hi>learned</hi> Reader will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
neither ſtrange nor difficult. And for
the ſake of the <hi>unlearned,</hi> which are not
ſo well verſt and ſtudyed in forein
Languages, I have kept my ſelf to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> not ſpeaking any where
in a <hi>ſtrange tongue</hi> without an <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
the ſenſe of every ſuch Quotation being
either declared before, or delivered after
it. Laſtly, whereas the Name of <hi>Appius
Claudius</hi> doth many times occur in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the <hi>Roman Tribunes,</hi> it is not always
to be underſtood of the ſame Man, but of
diverſe men of the ſame Name in their
<pb facs="tcp:114881:4"/>
ſeveral Ages; as the name of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the
<hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſignifieth not one man but
three, that is to ſay, the Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> in
the Goſpels, <hi>Claudius</hi> in the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
and that moſt bloudy Tyrant <hi>Nero</hi> in the
Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Which being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
I ſhall no longer keep the Reader in
Portch or Entrance; but let him take a view
of the Houſe it ſelf, the ſeveral Rooms, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
and Furniture of it; long Prefaces to
no long Diſcourſes, being like the Gates of
<hi>Mindum</hi> amongſt the Antients, which were
too great and large for ſo ſmall a City.</p>

            <p>NOr may we think becauſe
the puniſhment of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Princes doth belong to
God, that preſently this power
is devolved on us, to whom no

by God but only to obey and
ſuffer. But ſtill I muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of private perſons.
For if there be now any <hi>popular
Officers</hi> ordained to moderate
the licentiouſneſs of Kings
(ſuch as were the <hi>Ephori,</hi> ſet up
of old againſt the Kings of
<hi>Sparta;</hi> the <hi>Tribunes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

power perhaps, as the world
now goes, the <hi>three Estates</hi> are
ſeized in each ſeveral Kingdom,
when they are ſolemnly aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled)
ſo far am I from hindring
them to put reſtraints upon the
exorbitant power of Kings, as
their Office bindes them; that
I conceive them rather to be
guilty of a perfidious diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if they connive at Kings
when they play the Tyrants, or
wantonly inſult on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

betray the Subjects
Liberties; of which they knew
they were made Guardians by
Gods own Ordinance.</p>

very cunningly conceal their Author, and never

they do upon this reaſon, that if their Doctrine

under this <hi>obedience,</hi> I alſo do include that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and diſcretion, which private perſons
ought to have and to impoſe upon themſelves as

nor put themſelves on any publick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings;
if any thing be amiſs in the publick

it appertains not unto them to be tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
active in it, or to put their hands unto the
work, whoſe hands are tied (and to be tied) on
all ſuch occaſions; but that they make it known
unto the Magiſtrate, whoſe hands are only left
at liberty to effect the ſame. My meaning is,
that they do nothing uncommanded. For when
the power or precept of the Governor doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene,
they are then armed with juſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and may do accordingly. For as the Princes

to ſay, The Father of the Countrey, the Shepheard
of his people, the preſerver of the publick peace,
the great diſtributer of juſtice, and the avenger
of the innocent; he muſt be ſomewhat more then
mad who is not pleaſed with ſuch a Government.
But ſeeing that all Ages do afford examples of
negligent and ſlothful Princes, who have no care
at all of the publick ſafety; of others who are ſo
intent of their private profit, as to make markets
of all laws and priviledges, and to expoſe their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and their favours both unto open ſale: of
ſome who drain their peoples purſes to no other
end, but to maintain a vain and waſtful prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and ſome who ſpend their time in nothing
more, then either the rifling of the ſubjects houſes,
the deflouring of their wives and daughters, or
in the ſlaughter of the innocent: that theſe ſhould
be received for Princes, and their commands
obeyed at all, even in lawful matters, is ſuch a
thing, as ſome will hardly be perſwaded to conſent
unto. For where men finde ſo much unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſuch filthy facts, as do not only miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> but a private perſon; when
they ſee no reſemblance of that Image of God,
which ought to ſhine moſt brightly in a Chriſtian

of ſuch a <hi>Minister of Gods,</hi> as is <hi>ordained</hi> for

and for the puniſhment of thoſe that are <hi>evil
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114881:13"/>
doers:</hi> they take him not for ſuch a Governour
whoſe office and authoritie is extolled ſo highly
in the Scriptures. And to ſay truth, it hath been
always naturally implanted in the ſouls of men,
not more to love and reverence a juſt vertuous
Prince, then to abominate and deteſt an ungodly
Tyrant.</p>
                  <p>"But if we look into Gods Book,<note place="margin">SECT. 25.</note> we ſhall there
be taught not only to ſubmit our ſelves to the
command of thoſe Princes, who faithfully and
as they ought do diſcharge their office; but of all
thoſe who are advanced unto the higheſt place of
Government, though they do nothing leſs then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their duties. For though the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> be one
of the greateſt bleſſings given by God for the good
of mankind; and that he hath confined the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
within certain limits: yet he declares, that
whatſoever they are they do receive their power
from no hand but his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if they principally do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the publick good, they are the greateſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and examples of his goodneſs to us; if they
prove inſolent and unjuſt, they are the executioners
of his wrath and judgement for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
that all are equally inveſted with that ſacred
Majeſty wherewith he hath apparelled the moſt
lawful powers. I ſhall proceed no further in this
preſent buſineſs, till I have made ſome proof of
that which is ſaid before. Not that I mean to
ſpend my time in the proof of this, that a wicked
King is one of Gods curſes on the earth: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that there is none who gainſay the ſame,
we ſhould ſay no more in this of Kings, then of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114881:13"/>
the Theef that ſteals thy goods, or the Adulterer
that defiles thy marriage bed, or the Murderer
that ſeeks thy life, all which are reckoned for
Gods curſes in the holy Scripture. The point we
purpoſe to make proof of, goeth not down
ſo eaſily; that is to ſay, That in the vileſt men,
and moſt unworthy of all honour, if they be once
advanced to the publick government, there doth
reſide that excellent and divine authoritie, which
God hath given in holy Scripture to thoſe who are
the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of his heavenly juſtice: who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

God hath given us in his Book; holding the

diſpoſing Kingdoms, and ſetting up ſuch Kings as

is no more <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> no brighter beam of Gods

or children throw aſide that natural dutie which
they owe their Parents, becauſe their Parents are
unkinde, and it may be cruel. Thoſe which doe

he openeth a moſt dangerous gap to diſobedience
and rebellions in moſt States in Chriſtendom, in

before delivered unto the conſcience of the <hi>ſubject,</hi>
and utterly diſabled them from lifting up their hands

when they are ſolemnly aſſembled; whom

connive at Kings when they play the Tyrants, or

gap through which rebellions and ſeditions have
found ſo plauſible a paſſage in the Chriſtian world,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114881:25"/>
to the dethroning of ſome Kings and Princes, the
death of others. For through this gap, broke in thoſe
dangerous and ſeditious doctrines, that the <hi>inferiour
Magiſtrates are ordained by God, and not appointed
by the King,</hi> or the Supreme Powers; that being ſo
ordained by God, <hi>they are by him inabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the King to rule according unto juſtice and the
laws eſtabliſhed;</hi> that if <hi>the King be refractary and
and unreclaimable, they are to call him to account,</hi> and
to provide for the ſafety of the Common-wealth by
all ways and means which may conduce unto the
preſervation of it: and finally (which is the darling
doctrine of theſe later times) <hi>that there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in all Governments, and that the</hi> three Eſtates
<hi>conveened in</hi> Parliament (or by what other name

to the</hi> King, <hi>but co-ordinate with him;</hi> and

is defective in him, but a <hi>coercive alſo</hi> to reſtrain
his Actions, &amp; a <hi>corrective</hi> too to reform his Errors.
But this I give you now in the generals only; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
you ſhall ſee it more particularly, and every
Author cited in his own words for the proof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Many of which as they did live in <hi>CALVINS</hi>

to me, that this paſſage fell not from his pen
by chance, but was laid of purpoſe as a <hi>Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block</hi>
in the Subjects way, to make him fall in the
performance of his Chriſtian duty both to God and
man. For though the Book of <hi>Institutions</hi> had
been often printed in his life time, and received ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
alterations and additions (as being enlarged
from a ſmall <hi>Octavo,</hi> of not above 29 ſheets, to a
large <hi>folio</hi> of 160) yet this particular paſſage ſtill
remained unchanged, and hath continued as it is
from the firſt Edition of it, which was in the year
1536. not long after his firſt coming to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. But to proceed in our deſign. What fruits theſe
dangerous doctrines have produced amongſt us,
we have ſeen too plainly; and we may ſee as plainly,
if we be not blinde, through what gap theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
entred, on what foundation they were built,
and unto whoſe authoritie we ſtand indebted for all
thoſe miſeries and calamities which are fallen upon
us. Yet to ſay truth, the man deſired to be concealed,
and not reputed for the Author of ſuch ſtrange
concluſions which have reſulted from his principles:
and therefore laies it down with great art and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Si qui,</hi> and <hi>Fortè,</hi> and <hi>ut nunc res habent,</hi>
that is to ſay, <hi>Perhaps,</hi> and <hi>as the world now goes,</hi>
and <hi>if there be ſuch Officers as have been formerly,</hi>
are the three diſguiſes, which he hath masked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

them as the <hi>Ephori,</hi> the <hi>Demarchi,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunes</hi>
had, as <hi>perhaps</hi> they have; the <hi>Subject</hi> is no doubt
in a good condition, as good a man as the beſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>
of them all. But if the <hi>Ephori,</hi> the <hi>Demar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>
and the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> were not appointed at the firſt
for the reſtiaint and regulating of the <hi>Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
as indeed they were not; and if the <hi>three Eſtates</hi>
in each ſeveral Kingdom have not that authoritie,
which the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> did in fine uſurp,
and the <hi>Demarchi</hi> are ſuppoſed to have, as indeed
they have not; <hi>perhaps</hi> and <hi>peradventure</hi> will not

grounds, then before he did. Therefore to take
away this <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> and remove this <hi>rub,</hi> I ſhall
propoſe and prove theſe three points enſuing. 1. That
the <hi>Ephori,</hi> the <hi>Demarchi,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi>

dreams of, and therefore of no power to controul
their King. Which if I clearly prove, as I hope I

away ſo many of the faireſt Jewels in the Regal

the eſtate by conqueſt, and claiming by no other
Title then by that of Arms, there is no queſtion
to be made but that they governed in the way of

Familie was divided from the very firſt, into two
Regal Stems or Branches, both honoured with the

by their mutual Counſels; of which the eldeſt
houſe was that of <hi>Agidae,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Agis,</hi> ſon

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114881:29"/>
doth appear by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> where ſpeaking of the

looſe the reigns of Government, and was the firſt
that laid aſide that ſole and abſolute power of a
King; whereupon followed great diſorder and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,
which continued long. For the people
finding themſelves at liberty, became very bold and
diſobedient; ſome of the Kings which did ſucceed
being hated to the very death, becauſe they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
the recovery of their old authoritie; others
being forced to diſſemble and wink at any thing,
either in hope thereby to gain the love of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

of the diſſolute and rebellious multitude, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomus</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114881:29"/>

ſlain amongſt them in a tumult. At ſuch a dear

and good will of the raſcall rabble; by which he
purchaſed nothing but the loſſe of Royalty, beſides
the empty honour of having the ſecond houſe of
the Royal Family to be called by his name, the
<hi>Eurypontidae.</hi> Things growing thus from bad to
worſe, and both the Kings and people waxing
weary of that diſorder and confuſion which did
reign amongſt them; both parties caſt their eyes
upon <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> of whoſe integrity and wiſdome
they had conceived a great opinion. For the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
finding that their Kings had nothing but the
name and title, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and
nothing elſe whereby they differed from the reſt,
ſent many a ſeveral meſſage to him to require his

as deſirous that he ſhould return (being then gone
abroad to travel) in hope that the authority of his

their inſolency and diſobedience towards them.
<note n="k" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> But herein they were both deceived. For <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
ſeeing how things ſtood, reſolved to apply

which is, that if a difference grew between the

be ſome to arbitrate between them, and to have
the caſting voice amongſt them when the difference
could not be agreed. And this is that which <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>
and <hi>Mandroclidas</hi> (two that had been <hi>Ephori</hi>)

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But becauſe <hi>they ſhould give
their voices unto that King who had the best rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

that they two agreeing might lawfully do what
they would without controlment; that to reſiſt
the Kings was a breach of law, conſidering that
the <hi>Ephori,</hi> by law, had no power nor privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but only to arbitrate between them, when
there was any cauſe of jarre or controverſie."</q>
And this was ſo received at <hi>Sparta,</hi> for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted

doubting but they two ſhould agree together, and
thereby make the <hi>Ephori</hi> of no power nor uſe. So
then we have three reaſons of the inſtitution, (and
more then theſe I cannot finde) of which there is not
one that favoureth the device of <hi>CALVIN;</hi> or
intimateth that the authority of the <hi>Ephori</hi> was

thoſe eight and twenty, which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

who as it is confeſſed by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> did firſt ordain

<hi>Ephorus,</hi> or the firſt that joyned the <hi>Ephori</hi> to

by <hi>Theopompus,</hi> became not preſently of
ſuch authority and power, as by degrees they did
attain to: For being choſen by the Kings as their

                  </gap>, even from their very neereſt friends, as

that he was better skilled in bearing injuries

                  </gap>. Which I
propoſe not ſo much out of a deſire to comply with
<hi>Scaliger,</hi> who for ought I can ſee, aimed at no ſuch
matter; as on the credit of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> whom he ſo
much ſlighteth. For in <hi>Euſebius Chronicon</hi> of
<hi>Joſeph Scaligers</hi> own Edition, after he hath put
down the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori</hi> in the ſecond of
the fifth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as before I told you; he gives
this <hi>Item</hi> in the third of the five and fiftieth (which
is the very ſame that <hi>Laertius</hi> ſpeaks of) <hi>Chilo qui

the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> as before

yet after they were reckoned for the <hi>Officers</hi> of the

if I gueſs aright, that his wife ſeeing what deſign

he hoped to leave it ſtronger and more durable then
it was before. But the event declared unto all the

power of Soveraigntie when once communicated

us otherwiſe, and eaſily lay open the apparent
danger of ſuch weak ſurmiſes. For being made
<hi>Officers of State,</hi> one of the firſt points they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
was that the Kings made Oath unto them
once in every moneth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

and that they would preſerve the Kindom in the
beſt condition that they could: the <hi>Ephori</hi> making
oath to them in the name of the Citie, whoſe <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
they were, and by whom intruſted. Next
they attempt to place ſuch <hi>Counſellors</hi> about the
Kings, as they might <hi>confide</hi> in, beginning with
ſuch Kings as were under Age; and the firſt trial
which they made was in appointing one <hi>Cleandrides</hi>

of their uſurpations and incroachments was
to reſtrain their Kings in the point of <hi>marriage,</hi> and
to impoſe ſome fine or diſgrace upon them, if they
preſumed to marrie againſt their liking. <hi>Anaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drides</hi>

<hi>Archidamus</hi> the 17. of the ſecond Houſe maried a

And therefore it is noted by <hi>Thucydides</hi> not without

which followed not long after that moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
fact, upon the perſons of their Princes. The
Kings had long ſince ſtomached them and their

and therefore thought it ſafer to procure

that being a ſtout and active Prince, he was not

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114881:41"/>
ſuch thoughts is affirmed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where he
informs us that <hi>Lyſander</hi> had a purpoſe to take away

to bring about, his Succeſſors did at laſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh.
Of which <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> and <hi>Agis,</hi> joyning
their hands and heads together did proceed ſo far,
that going into the Market place well attended by
their friends and followers, they plucked the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori</hi>
from their ſeats, and ſubſtituted others in
their rooms<note n="p" place="margin">Plutarch in Agis &amp; Cleom.</note>, whom they conceived would be
more pliant to their preſent enterpriſes: which was
the firſt actual attempt, that ever had been made
againſt them by the Kings of <hi>Sparta.</hi> But <hi>evulgato
imperii Arcano,</hi> when ſo great a myſterie of State
was once diſcovered, that the <hi>Ephori</hi> were but
mortal men, and might as eaſily be diſplaced and

immediately upon his reſtitution to the Kingdom,
made the like removal, and diſplaced thoſe who
had took part againſt him with the former Kings<note n="q" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>.
So that the ice being broken, and the way made
open, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſon unto <hi>Leonidas</hi> had the fairer
way to abrogate the Office utterly, which at laſt
he did. For being a brave and gallant Prince,
and ſeeing that the project he was bent upon for
the reduction of the Common-wealth to its
primitive honour, could not be brought about
but by their deſtruction; he fell upon them with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114881:42"/>
his Souldiers as they ſate ſate at ſupper, and killed
four of them in the place, the fift eſcaping ſhrewdly
hurt to the neereſt Sanctuarie<note n="r" place="margin">Id ibid.</note>. That done he
went into the Market place, and overthrew all the
Chairs of the <hi>Ephori</hi> ſaving only one, which he
reſerved for himſelf as his Chair of State, and
ſitting in the ſame in the ſight of the people, gave
them an accompt of his proceedings, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

have held it longer, and with better liking; but

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> (11) Thus have we made a brief diſcoverie of
the <hi>Spartan Ephori,</hi> upon what grounds firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
and on what deſtroyed; by what foul
practiſes and unlawful means they gained the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie</hi>
of the State, and by what they loſt it:
how, and by what degrees they came from low and
mean beginnings to ſo ſtrange a <hi>tyrannie,</hi> and with
what ſuddenneſs they loſt their power and their
lives together. But in all this there is not any ſhew
or colour for that which is affirmed by <hi>CALVIN,</hi>
no ground for, nor veritie at all in that <hi>aſſertion,</hi> that
the <hi>Ephori</hi> were at firſt ordained to <hi>oppoſe the
Kings,</hi> to regulate their proceedings, and reſtrain
their power: but rather that they were ordained
(as indeed they were) to curb the Senate, to be the
Miniſters of the Kings, and ſub-ſervient to them;
to ſit in Judgement for them, and diſcharge ſuch
Offices, as the Kings pleaſed to truſt them with, in
their times of abſence. If <hi>Calvins</hi> popular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
have no more authoritie, then the <hi>Spartan
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114881:43"/>
Ephori,</hi> according to the rules of their Inſtitution,
they will have little colour to controll their <hi>Princes,</hi>
and leſs for putting a reſtraint on the <hi>Regal</hi>
power. The moſt they can pretend to muſt
be uſurpation, and that will hold no longer, if
it hold ſo long, then they have power to make
it good by bloud and violence, which I hope
<hi>Calvin</hi> did not aim at. And if they have no
other ground then an unjuſt title, <hi>preſcription</hi>
will not ſerve the turn, (for <hi>nullum tempus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currit
Regi,</hi> as our Lawyers tell us) when a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Prince is concerned in it, and oppreſſed by
it. If any <hi>Popular</hi> ſpirits entertain ſuch hopes, if
nothing elſe will ſatisfie their vaſt ambitions but
to be equal with their Kings and Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
and at laſt above them: let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what became of the <hi>Spartan Ephori,</hi> and
that there was a <hi>Cleomenes</hi> which called them
to a ſad account for all thoſe inſolencies and affronts
which they had put upon himſelf and his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
And let all Kings and Supreme Governors take
heed by the example of theſe <hi>Spartan</hi> Princes, how
they let looſe the reins of Government, and
lay them on the necks of the common people:
which if unbridled once, and left at libertie,
will not be eaſily induced to receive that <hi>Bit</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

people in the State of <hi>Rome</hi> to deſire
ſome <hi>Officers</hi> of their own, and the conſiderations
which induced the <hi>Senate</hi> to give way unto it, are
obvious to the eyes of every Reader, which hath
peruſed the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtories: yet I ſhall briefly lay
it down, the better to remove the intimation which
we finde in <hi>Calvin,</hi> that they were purpoſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to oppoſe the <hi>Conſuls.</hi> The ſtorie then in
brief is this. The people having not long before
expulſed their Kings, and got ſome reputation by
their proweſs in thoſe petit States which bordered
neereſt to the City, found quickly that the <hi>libertie</hi>
which they expected was nothing but a <hi>golden
dream,</hi> not able to protect them from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Gaols,</hi> and that their reputation in the wars
would not pay their debts, or ſave them from the
hands of their cruel Creditors. For ſerving in
the wars at their own proper charges, and having
little elſe to ſubſiſt upon but their trades or labor,
they were fain ſometimes to take up money upon
<hi>uſurie.</hi> And though they did return from the
wars with <hi>victorie,</hi> and ſhewed thoſe honorable
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114881:45"/>
ſcars which they had received, fighting in defence
of their Countrey and the Common-wealth; yet
this did edifie but little with their hungry Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
<note n="a" place="margin">Plutarch in M. Coriolano.</note> who did not ſell their goods, if they were
not ſolvent, but apprehended their perſons alſo,
and either laid them up in the common priſons,
or made them ſerve in ſtead of Bond-men, and
made them ſubject to the whip and other baſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
fit for none but <hi>Slaves.</hi> And ſomewhat
to this purpoſe the old man complained, as we
read in <hi>Livie,</hi> declaring to the people (who were
apt to hear it) how his Patrimonie had been ſeized
on by the mercileſs Uſurers, his perſon appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by them, and that he was not only made
a <hi>Slave,</hi> but marked out for <hi>ſlaughter: Inde oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare
tergum foedum recentibus veſtigiis verberum</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Livie. hiſt. l. 2.</note>,
ſhewing withall upon his back the miſerable prints
which the whip had left. This made the people
murmur, and at laſt to mutinie, and in tumultuous
manner, <hi>minaciter magis quam ſuppliciter,</hi> rather
with threats then ſupplications to require the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to take ſome courſe for their relief: reſolving
otherwiſe to go no more unto the wars, ſerve the
State who would. The <hi>Senate</hi> promiſed fair, as
there was good cauſe, (the <hi>Volſci</hi> preſſing hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to their very gates); and by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
won the people, and obtained a victorie. But
when the wars were done, and performance looked
for, in ſtead of finding a redreſs of their former
grievances, the rigor of the law took place, <hi>&amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditoribus
tradibantur,</hi> and they were ſeiſed on by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114881:45"/>
their <hi>Creditors</hi> as in former times: the <hi>Senate</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it unreaſonable to make the law ſubmit to the
neceſſities of particular men, and againſt law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
any man of the debts which were due unto
them.<note n="c" place="margin">Dionyſ. Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſ. lib. 6.</note> But a new war approaching, a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made, and that neglected alſo when the war
was ended; the people ſeeing no relief was like to
come from the hands of the <hi>Senators, Longè aliâ
quam primò inſtituerant viâ graſsabantur,</hi> began
to lend an ear to ſome deſperate Counſels, and fell
to entertain ſuch hopes, as formerly they durſt never
dream of. For drawing themſelves into a body
under the conduct of <hi>Sicinius</hi> a troubleſome and
ſeditious perſon, they forſook the City, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
upon an hill adjoyning: reſolving as they
gave it out, to ſeek new dwellings, and that there
was no place in <hi>Italy</hi> but would afford them air and
water, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ground in which they
might be buried. There is no queſtion to be made,
but if the <hi>Senate</hi> had beheld the action with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and ſcorn, as <hi>Appius</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Dionyſ. Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn. l. 6.</note>, and C. <hi>Martius</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Plutarch in Coriolano.</note>,
did adviſe they ſhould; the people out of love to
their wives and children, would have returned to
their houſes: or if they had preſented them in time
with any tolerable mitigations of the former laws,
they might have taken off their edge, and appeaſed
the tumult. But giving way unto their furie till
it grew too high, and ſhewing in their reſolutions
far more fear then courage; the people got the
better of them, and thought they ſtood upon the
higher ground, as indeed they did. Which pride
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114881:46"/>
and high conceit of theirs was the more increaſed,
by the authoritie and perſwaſions of one <hi>Junius
Brutus,</hi> who came not to them till they were too
far ingaged, to go off with ſafetie. A man, as the
Hiſtorian noteth, of a turbulent and ſeditious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

Inſomuch that when <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi>

and had brought the point to ſuch an iſſue, that there
was nothing wanting to make up the breach, but
ſome ſecuritie to be given on the part of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
that the people ſhould be no more deluded

and <hi>Caius Martius,</hi> (who after had the name of

how great a <hi>Seminarie</hi> of miſchiefs it would prove
to the Common-wealth, and calling all the Gods

and that the <hi>major</hi> part of the houſe did incline

ſhould paſs for nothing. For ſeeing that <hi>Tribunes</hi>

the honor of the State might be kept
upright, and that the Common-wealth was not

Things being brought unto this temper, and all

<hi>Tribunes of the people;</hi> of which <hi>Sicinius</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius

not more. The Articles and Conditions which
they had agreed on had bound them too preciſely

thoſe bonds, they were <hi>Priſoners</hi> ſtill. But firſt
they muſt be fortified with ſome ſpecial <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114881:48"/>
that whatſoever wrongs they did, they
would not be called to an accompt. To that end
<hi>Brutus</hi> taking his opportunitie whileſt the heats

A Priviledge which they found good uſe of in the
times ſucceeding, and made it ſerve their turns
upon all occaſions. <hi>Martius</hi> complained of them
in the <hi>Senate</hi> for diſobedience to the <hi>Conſuls,</hi>
and an intent to bring an <hi>Anarchie</hi> upon the State:
<note n="o" place="margin">Plutarh. in Coriolano.</note> they <hi>vote</hi> this for a <hi>breach of priviledge,</hi> and

<hi>Caeſo Quintius</hi> like a noble <hi>Patriot,</hi> joyns with the

them; this alſo is a <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>priviledge,</hi> and his
life ſhall pay for it<note n="q" place="margin">Id. l. 3.</note>. But to proceed, having
obtained this law for their own ſecuritie, their
next work was to break or paſs by thoſe laws by
which the State was governed in all times before,
and which themſelves had yeelded to at their firſt
creation. It was the practiſe of the City from
the firſt fnundation (and a continual cuſtom hath
the force of law) to give ſuch reſpect unto the
<hi>Senate,</hi> that the people did not <hi>vote</hi> nor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
any thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <note n="r" place="margin">Dionyſ. Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſ. l. 7.</note>, which
the <hi>Senate</hi> had not firſt debated and reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This though no <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>priviledge</hi> was a
main impediment to the advancing of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which they had in hand, and therefore fit
to be removed, as removed it was: and ſo a way
made open unto that confuſion, which did expoſe
the State to ſo many changes, that it was never
conſtant to one form of government. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obtained, the next thing to be brought about,
was to bring the election of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> into the
hands of the people (who had before the leaſt part
in it) that ſo depending mutually upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they might co-operate together to deſtroy
the State, and bring it abſolutely under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the common people. For at the firſt,
according to the Articles of the Inſtitution, the
<hi>Tribunes</hi> were to be elected in <hi>Comitiis Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis</hi>
as before was ſaid, where none but men of
years and ſubſtance (ſuch as were of the <hi>Liverie,</hi>

                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:114881:49"/>

of their Clients or dependents ſet up whom they
liſted. They muſt no longer hold this power. The
<hi>Tribunes</hi> were the creatures of the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and muſt be made by none but them. A
law muſt therefore be propounded to put the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
wholly into the hands of the people, and to
tranſact the ſame in <hi>Comitiis Tributis,</hi> where no
<hi>Patrician</hi> was to <hi>vote,</hi> but all things carried by
the voyces of the raſcal Rabble. Which though
it cauſed much heat and no ſmall ado, yet it was
carried at the laſt; <hi>Appius</hi> complaining openly as
his cuſtom was, <hi>Rempub. per metum prodi,</hi> that
the <hi>Senate</hi> did deſtroy the Common-wealth by their
want of courage. And whereas at the firſt they
had ſo much modeſtie as not to come into the
<hi>Senate</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> (4) But their main buſineſs was to pull down
the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and make them of no more eſteem
then the <hi>common</hi> ſort. And upon this they ſet
their ſtrength, and made it the firſt hanſel of their
new authoritie. <hi>Martius</hi> had ſpoke ſome words in
<hi>Senate</hi> which diſpleaſed the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> and they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114881:49"/>
incenſe the people to revenge the injury: who
promiſing to aſſiſt them in their undertakings,
an <hi>Officer</hi> is forthwith ſent to apprehend him.
This cauſed the <hi>Patricians</hi> whom the cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
to ſtand cloſe together, and to oppoſe
this ſtrange incroachment; and generally to affirm,
as moſt true it was, that when they yeelded to

they accuſed of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>ſedition,</hi> in
that he had intrenched upon their authority, which
was made ſacred by the Lawes: and doubtleſſe

had he not died before his triall. Which
victory on <hi>Martius,</hi> and the death of <hi>Appius,</hi> did
ſo diſcourage the Nobility and puffe up the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi>
that from this time forwards (as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian

they liſted to anſwer for themſelves before the
people, and to ſubmit their lives to their finall
ſentence: which as it did increaſe the power of
the <hi>popular</hi> faction in the depreſſing of the <hi>Nobles,</hi>

And yet the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> did not ſo give

they had no other way to effect the ſame,
then by raiſing ſeditions in the State, and putting
the people into Arms upon all occaſions: at which
they were ſo perfect, and ſo conſtant in it, that
ſeldome the whole year went round without ſome
tumult or ſedition of their ſetting forward, as
will appear to any one who is verſed in <hi>Livie.</hi>
If they held quiet for one year, as they ſeldom

pleaſe to know, that there was an intent from the

Power of all into the hands of the people; that is

untill they gained the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and the two <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles</hi>
(which were under officers to the <hi>Tribunes</hi>)
to be choſen out of their own body. Which once

that the people might have liberty to chooſe the

having got this ground they went on a main. For

was never in a way to be brought about, till the

being men of excellent parts and great abilities,
did moſt unfortunately fall on the undertaking;
and being fallen upon it did deviſe all ways which
either art or wit could preſent unto them to effect the
work. Of theſe <hi>Tiberius</hi> was the eldeſt, who ſtumbling
in the way on the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> as being a means
to make the poor people more confiderable, and the
rich leſs powerful; and finding that <hi>Octavius</hi> one of

He had before inflamed the people by making a
ſeditious ſpeech to prefer their buſineſs; and now
he takes a courſe to inflame them more, for the
advancement of his own. For one of his friends being
found dead upon a ſudden, not without ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion

apparrel, and brought his ſons before the people,
into the Common <hi>Forum,</hi> beſeeching them to have
compaſſion on his Wife and Children, as one that
utterly deſpaired of his own ſafetie, having for their
ſakes got the hatred of the <hi>Noble</hi> men. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he would be the firſt man in the <hi>Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,</hi>
apparelled all in black, his face ſwelled
with tears, and looking heavily upon the matter,
would pray the people to ſtand to him, ſaying, he
was afraid his Enemies would come in the night,
and overthrow his houſe to kill him. By means
of which devices he ſo wrought upon them, that
many of them bought tents and lay about his
houſe continually, to keep him from the hands of
his deadly Enemies. So that being ſure of their
concurrence and aſſiſtance in any project which
he ſhould ſet on foot to advance himſelf, under
pretence of doing ſervice to the Common-wealth;
he preſently propoſed a law, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
that any man that would might appeal
from the <hi>Judges</hi> to the people in what cauſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
And that he might be ſure to embaſe the
<hi>Senate,</hi> to the improvement and increaſe of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114881:56"/>

higher nature, which was to adde unto the <hi>Senate</hi>
an equal number of the <hi>Equites,</hi> or the <hi>Roman

have libertie of <hi>voting</hi> in all publick buſineſſes
with the antient <hi>Senators.</hi> In paſſing which and
other of his <hi>Popular</hi> laws he got this trick, (and he
was very conſtant to it) that if he found the ſenſe
of the houſe to be againſt him, and was not like
to carry with him the major part of the voyces,
he would quarrel with his fellow <hi>Tribunes</hi> to ſpin
out the time till his partie were all come together;
and if that could not do it neither, then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
the Aſſembly to ſome other day. But

retired in his Countrey-houſe, far from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of that State, which did not otherwiſe
ſubſiſt but by his abilities. Nor could they look on
their <hi>Dictators</hi> but with eyes of malice, although
they had as much authoritie as that State could
give them, or any of their <hi>Kings</hi> had enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whom they endevour to make ſubject to their
pride and tyrannie by all means imaginable. And
to that end, ſometimes denyed him the honor of a
<hi>Triumph,</hi> though he had deſerved it in all mens
judgements but their own; and ſometimes making
this <hi>Magiſter Equitum</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Id. lib. 22.</note>, to be of equal power and
authoritie with him: and finally ſometimes they
declaim againſt him<note n="m" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>, to make him of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Id. lib. 2.</note>, that the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> was ſuppreſſed
and captivated by the power of the <hi>Tribunes;</hi> and
we can no where finde that they improved their
modeſtie, as they did their power. Nor did they
only quarrel with the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(though that had been an high affront to the
<hi>Supreme Magiſtrate</hi>) but threatned to commit them
to the <hi>Priſon</hi> alſo, and many times their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
were not made in vain. For thus we read,
that <hi>Caius Marius</hi> being <hi>Tribune</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Plutarch in Mario.</note>, threatned to
ſend <hi>Cotta</hi> the <hi>Conſul</hi> unto Priſon, but afterwards
was taken off by fair perſwaſions: and <hi>Sulpitus,</hi>

one as violent as he, though not ſo valiant, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted

houſe<note n="p" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>, and killed one of their ſons there, who
was not ſo quick of foot as to ſcape his hands.
Which though they were but bare attempts were
yet lewd enough, ſufficiently to the diſhonor of
ſuch eminent Magiſtrates, and to the infamy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of the publick Government. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Quintius</hi> will tell you in the <hi>Dialogue</hi> with his

had cauſed ſuch gallant men as <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>P. Scipio</hi> to be caſt in Priſon. And if we make

to be caſt headlong out of his ſeat, to the
no ſmall danger of his life, only for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him in the middle of a factious ſpeech;
which was an inſolencie beyond impriſonment.
To ſpeak of their behaviour towards the other
Magiſtrates were a thing impertinent. For if
the <hi>Conſuls</hi> and <hi>Dictators</hi> could not ſcape their
hands, there is no queſtion to be made but that the

fet up to oppoſe the <hi>Conſuls;</hi> but the beſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do affirm that they were inſtituted only to
<hi>protect</hi> the people, and to protect the people in
ſuch caſes only when they did ſuffer any <hi>tort</hi> or
unjuſt oppreſſion. He reckoneth them for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of ſuch <hi>popular Magiſtrates</hi> as were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to moderate and reſtrain the vaſt <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi>
and other Supreme Magiſtrates; but the beſt
Writers do affirm that the <hi>Tribunes</hi> were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
till the <hi>Kings</hi> were outed; nor inſtituted
at the firſt to reſtrain the <hi>Conſular</hi> power, though
by degrees they did reſtrain it as they pleaſed; and
finally that they were again abridged of their
power and <hi>tyrannie,</hi> aſſoon as <hi>Monarchie</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
and the State brought to be obedient to
one <hi>Soveraign</hi> Prince. He ſeems to intimate that
the <hi>Conſuls</hi> were not wronged by ſuch <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi>
as the <hi>Tribunes</hi> daily made againſt them,
and that the <hi>Tribunes</hi> did no more in ſuch <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi>
then by their place and office they were
bound to do. But the beſt Writers do affirm that
the <hi>Conſuls</hi> made complaint from time to time of
thoſe wrongs and inſolencies which thoſe proud
creatures of the people did afflict them with; and
they complained not without cauſe, as their ſtories
tell us. So that there is but little ground for the
ſuppoſition, touching the firſt creation of theſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114881:60"/>
mighty <hi>Tyrants,</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> trimly puts upon
us; leſs for the application of it to his end and
purpoſe. What other power ſoever they enjoyed
or exerciſed more then the power of <hi>interceding,</hi>
when any <hi>Bill</hi> or <hi>Ordinance</hi> was to paſs the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
by which the people might have ſuffered
in their goods and <hi>liberties,</hi> was an incroachment
on the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and wreſted from them by ſtrong
hand, ſometimes with bloud, but never without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
tumults. The beſt uſe can be made of
ſuch falſe ſurmiſes, eſpecially when they are falſe
and factious too (and ſome good uſes may be
made of the ſtrongeſt poyſons) is that an <hi>Item</hi>
may be taken by all Kings, Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Supreme
Governors to have a care of their Eſtates, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuffer any <hi>Tribunes,</hi> or men of <hi>Tribunitian</hi>
ſpirits, or ſuch as challenge to themſelves <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitian</hi>
power, to grow up under them, or live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the verge of their Dominions. The <hi>Tribune</hi>
and the <hi>Tribunitian</hi> ſpirit are no friend to <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie;</hi>
and have ſo much of <hi>Pompey</hi> in them (who
reſtored the Office) that they will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to endure an <hi>equall,</hi> much leſs to ſuffer a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</hi>
For further proof of which (if more proof
be requiſite) and for diſcovering to the world with
what arts and practiſes thoſe factious and ſeditious
ſpirits did attain their height: it would be a moſt
excellent piece of ſervice to all <hi>Soveraign</hi> Princes,

at the firſt, was under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Kings, all of them of the race of <hi>Cecrops,</hi>
from whom his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> were called <hi>Cecropidae:</hi>
and they, as other Kings in thoſe antient times,
<hi>ut libitum imperitabant</hi>

<hi>Theſeus</hi> the tenth from <hi>Cecrops,</hi> was the
firſt King of <hi>Athens</hi> which let goe his hold, and
parted with ſo many of the <hi>Regal</hi> rights, as made
the Kings weak and the Subjects wanton. For
having a deſire to incorporate all the Inhabitants
of <hi>Attica</hi> into the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> the better to
unite them againſt forein force, and to aſſemble
them together as occaſion ſerved, he was fain to
win them to it by large promiſes of giving them
ſome ſhare in the publick Government: without
which bait, the wealthier ſort, and ſuch as had

<hi>Religion;</hi> the main points of Soveraigntie. And
in this State things ſtood till the death of <hi>Codrus,</hi>
the ſeventh from <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who giving up his own
life to preſerve his Countrey, became ſo honored
and admired amongſt his people, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
for his ſake to have no more Kings, for
fear they ſhould never meet with any who might

The like <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth affirm<note n="e" place="margin">Euſeb. in Chro.</note>, and all Authors

They could not fall immediately from a <hi>Regal</hi>

of the State was caſt on the peoples ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the form thereof made meerly <hi>popular</hi>
or <hi>Democratical.</hi> For certainly it is moſt true,
that never any <hi>Democratical</hi> State ſhewed it ſelf at

people of <hi>Attica</hi> to deſert their dwellings, and be

ordered their affairs, that the chief Offices of the

them: but the election of thoſe Officers, and the

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114881:70"/>
Tribunes</hi> were not ordained at firſt for thoſe
ends and purpoſes which are ſuppoſed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
but more particularly, that neither the <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>

the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> nor the <hi>Demarchi</hi> of authority to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

directly contrary unto <hi>Calvins</hi> aim) that the <hi>Ephori</hi>
were at firſt ordained to eaſe the <hi>Kings,</hi> and to be
aiding to them againſt the <hi>Senate,</hi> who began ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to incroach on the <hi>Regal</hi> power: that the <hi>Tribunes</hi>

the people from unjuſt oppreſſion, and that
their oppoſition to the <hi>Conſuls</hi> was accounted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to be againſt the rules of their inſtitution,
and a breach of Articles: And as for theſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchi</hi>
whom we ſpake of laſt, that neither by
their <hi>inſtitution</hi> nor by <hi>uſurpation,</hi> they did oppoſe
againſt the <hi>Senate</hi> in behalf of the people, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
their commands upon the people, as their

in caſe the inſtances propoſed had been rightly

the licentiouſneſs of <hi>Kings</hi> &amp; <hi>ſoveraign</hi> Princes,
for proof of which they were produced. The <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>

power no other then the Dukes of <hi>Venice;</hi> ſave
that they were to have the command of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which thoſe Dukes have not. And for the

as it is from the firſt Edition, which was in
the year 1536. when the rebellion of <hi>Geneva</hi>
was yet freſh and talked of as an ill example. Nor
was the man deceived in his expectation; For as
he grew into eſteem and reputation in the world
abroad, ſo he attained at laſt to that power and
empire over the ſouls and conſciences of his
followers, that his errors were accounted <hi>Orthodox,</hi>
his defects perfections, and the revolt of the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi>
from rheir natural Prince muſt by no means
be called <hi>Rebellion,</hi> becauſe projected and purſued
by ſuch <hi>popular Officers,</hi> to whom it appertained of

and Princes. And though he doth not ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
that there either are or ought to be ſuch
<hi>popular Officers</hi> in every Realm or Common-wealth,
but brings it in upon the by with his <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands:</hi>

                     <hi>Bacons</hi> hiſtory of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh.</note>, and by the ſetting up of that
dangerous <hi>Si quis</hi> (<hi>ſi qui ſint populares Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
as his words there are) he ſeems to make a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114881:76"/>
                  <hi>Proclamation</hi> that where there were ſuch <hi>popular
Officers,</hi> it was their bounden duty to correct their
Princes after the manner of <hi>Geneva;</hi> where there
were none, the people were (God help them) in
an ill condition, unleſs ſome other means were
thought of, for their eaſe and remedie. Upon
which Principles of his, his followers raiſed ſuch
<hi>Poſitions,</hi> and purſued ſuch <hi>practiſes</hi> as have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
and embroyled the moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and made it of a <hi>Garden</hi> to become a Wilderneſs.
For finding that they could not eaſily create ſuch
<hi>Popular Magiſtrates</hi> to lord it over Kings and
Princes who had not been accuſtomed to the like
controlments; they put that power of regulating
the Supreme Authoritie either upon the body of
the people generally, whereof you were told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from <hi>Buchannan,</hi> or upon ſuch to whom they
ſhould communicate or transfer their power, as
occaſion ſerved, whereof you may hear further
in that which followeth. And that not only in
the caſe of <hi>civil libertie,</hi> for which the examples
of the <hi>Ephori</hi> and the <hi>Roman Tribunes</hi> were at
firſt found out, and that of the <hi>Demarchi</hi> thruſt

wherein the extraordinary calling of ſome
men in the holy Scriptures muſt ſerve for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
and examples to confirm their <hi>practiſes.</hi>
From hence it was that <hi>Buchannan</hi> doth not only
ſubject his King unto the Ordinary Judges and
Courts of Juſtice as before was noted: but fearing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114881:77"/>
that Kings would be too potent to be ſo kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
adviſeth this, <hi>Eorum interfectoribus praemia

                  <note n="c" place="margin">Buchann. de jure Regni.</note>, that rewards ſhould publickly be decreed

CALVIN</hi> profeſſeth for himſelf, that he was very

into ſo many Kingdomes; the <hi>Prelates</hi> of that

But after <hi>Spain</hi> became divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kingdomes, and that each Kingdome
had its Court, or <hi>Curia,</hi> as they call their
Parliament, the <hi>Clergie</hi> were eſteemed in

For proof of which we need but look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>General hiſtory of Spain,</hi> tranſlated

finde a <hi>Court</hi> or Parliament for the Realm

in the ſaid Eſtates</hi> conveened by King <hi>James</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:114881:92"/>

the Great, touching the War againſt
the <hi>Moores</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Id. lib. 9.</note>. And as for the Realm of
<hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> being appends on this
Crown, there is little queſtion to be made
but that the Biſhops and Clergie of both
enjoyed the place and priviledges of the
third Eſtate; both Kingdomes being antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
holden of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of his Erection
and the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops (as lying directly
under his noſe) more amply priviledged for
the moſt part then in other Countries. Thus
for <hi>Caſtile,</hi> we finde a <hi>Parliament of Lords,
Prelates, and Deputies of Towns</hi> ſummoned
at <hi>Toledo</hi> by <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the Noble, <hi>An.</hi> 1210.

the writ of Summons in the ſaid Kings time)
From this time till the laſt Parliament of King

not many (though not all) the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

may be further added the form and manner of the

called to Parliament, being the very ſame <hi>verbatim</hi>

ſome <hi>Acts</hi> have paſſed in <hi>Parliament,</hi> to which
the <hi>Prelates</hi> did not <hi>vote,</hi> nor could be preſent in
the Houſe when the Bill was paſſed; as in the

                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:114881:102"/>
This hath been touched on before, &amp; we told
you then, that this reſtraint was laid upon them,
not by the Common law of <hi>England,</hi> or any <hi>Act</hi>
or <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> by which they
were diſabled to attend that ſervice. It was their
own voluntary Act, none compelled them to it,
but only out of a conformity to ſome former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
(<hi>ad ſanctorum Canonum inſtituta</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Antiqu. Brit. in Gul. Courtney.</note>, as their
own words are) by which it was not lawfull for
the <hi>Clergy men</hi> to be either Judges or Aſſeſſors in
<hi>cauſa Sanguinis</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Conſtitut. Othobon. fol. 45.</note>. And yet they took ſuch care
to preſerve their Intereſts, that they did not only
give their <hi>Proxies</hi> for the repreſenting of their
perſons, but did put up their <hi>Proteſtation</hi> with a
<hi>ſalvo jure</hi> for the preſerving of their rights for the

Examples of the which are as full and frequent,
as their withdrawing themſelves on the ſaid occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
But then the main objection is, that as
ſome Acts have paſſed in Parliament <hi>abſentibus
Praelatis,</hi> when the <hi>Biſhops</hi> did abſent themſelves
of their own accord; ſo many things have been
tranſacted in the <hi>Parliament excluſo Clero,</hi> when the

though poſſibly they will find themſelves decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

then we have that famous Parliament (call it

for proof, that the <hi>inferiour Clergy</hi> had their place

which I am not ſure of) the <hi>Clergy</hi> could not
be excluded in an angry fit, or out of a particular

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114881:106"/>
But our main proofs are yet to come, which
are theſe that follow. Firſt it is evident that
antiently the <hi>Clergy</hi> of each ſeveral <hi>Dioceſe</hi> were
chargeable by Law for the expences of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
in attending the ſervice of the Parliament;
according as the <hi>Counties</hi> were by <hi>Common law</hi>
(ſince confirmed by Statute 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 11.) to
bear the charges of their Knights, the Burroughs
and Cities of their <hi>Repreſentees:</hi> which queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Laws had not taken care for, but that the
<hi>Clergy</hi> had their place in Parliament, as the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
had. And this appears by a Record<note n="z" place="margin">Rotul. Parent. 26 Ed. 3. pt. 1. M. 22.</note> of
26 of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. in which the Abbat

of the <hi>Regular Prelates;</hi> petitioned to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged

Which being but a general inference ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

<hi>Modus</hi> tells us more, and goeth more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to work than ſo. For in the ninth chapter,
ſpeaking of the courſe which was obſerv'd in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing
hard and difficult matters, it telleth us that
they uſed to chooſe 25 out of all degrees, (like
a grand Committee) to whoſe conſideration they
referred the point; that is to ſay, two <hi>Biſhops,</hi>
and three <hi>Proctors for the Clergy,</hi> two Earls, three
Barons, five Knights, five Citizens, and as many

Lord <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Marſhal</hi> were to call
the houſe, every degree or rank of men in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Order; and that if any of the <hi>Proctors of the
Clergy</hi> did not make appearance, the <hi>Biſhop of the</hi>
Dioceſe was to be fined 100 <hi>l.</hi> And in the 23d.
chapter it is ſaid expreſly, that as the Knights,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114881:107"/>
Citizens, &amp; Burgeſſes in things which do concern
the <hi>Commons</hi> have more authority than all the
Lords; ſo the <hi>Proctors for the Clergy,</hi> in things
which do concern the <hi>Clergy,</hi> have more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
than all the Biſhops. Which <hi>Modus</hi> if it be
as antient as the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour, as both
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> conceiveth<note n="u" place="margin">Preface to the 9th. part of Reports.</note>, and the title signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
it ſheweth the <hi>Clergies</hi> claim to a place in
Parliament to be more antient than the <hi>Commons</hi>
can pretend unto: but if no older than the reign
of King <hi>Edward</hi> third, as confidently is affirmed
in the <hi>Titles of Honour</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Titles of hon. pt 2. c. 5.</note>, if ſheweth that in the

Now that this clauſe was more than <hi>Verbal,</hi> and

is evident by the Acts and Statutes of King
<hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond: the paſſages whereof I ſhall
cite at large, the better to conclude what I have
in hand. The Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Arundel</hi> having got the maſtery of the King, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Commiſſion directed to themſelves and

But having got the better of his head-ſtrong

And finally that memorable paſſage in the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
51 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which in brief was this. The
<hi>Commons</hi> finding themſelves agrieved aſwell
with certain <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> made by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in
their Synods, as with ſome laws or <hi>Ordinances</hi>
which were lately paſſed, more to the advantage
of the Clergy than the Common people, put in a
Bill to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That no Act nor Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſhould from thenceforth be made or
granted on the Petition of the ſaid Clergy,
without the conſent of Commons; and that the
ſaid Commons ſhould not be bound in times to
come, by any conſtitutions made by the Clergy
of this Realm, for their own advantage, to which
the Commons of this Realm had not given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent."</q>
The reaſon of the which is this (and
'tis worth the marking) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>car eux ne veullent estre
obligez a nul de vos eſtatuz ne Ordinances faitz ſanz
leur aſſent,</hi> becauſe the ſaid Clergy did not think
themſelves bound, (as indeed they were not in
thoſe times) by any Statute, Act, or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
made without their Aſſent in the Court
of Parliament."</q> Which clearly ſhews that in
thoſe times the Clergy had their place in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the Commons had. Put all which hath
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114881:109"/>
been ſayd together, and tell me if it be not cleer
and evident that the <hi>inferiour Clergie</hi> had their
place in Parliament; whether the Clauſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the calling of them thither, were not more
than verbal in the Biſhops writs, and is true that
in the writ of ſummons directed to their ſeveral
and reſpective Biſhops they were called only <hi>ad
conſentiendum,</hi> to manifeſt their conſent to thoſe
<hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>ordinances,</hi> which by the <hi>Common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell</hi>
of the Realm were to be ordained. But then it
is as tru withall, that ſometimes their advice was
asked in the weighty matters, as in the 21 of K.
<hi>Richard</hi> the 2. and ſometimes they petitioned
and remonſtrated for redreſs of grievances,
as in the inſtances and caſes which were
laſt produced. And 'tis as true that if they
had been preſent only <hi>ad conſentiendum,</hi>
to teſtifie their aſſent to thoſe Acts which by the
common Counſell of the Realm were propoſed
unto them: their preſence was as neceſſary,
and their voice as requiſite to all intents and
purpoſes (for ought I can ſee) as the voice and
preſence of the <hi>Commons</hi> in the times we ſpeak
of. For in the writs of ſummons iſſued to the
ſeveral Sheriffs for the electing of Knights, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
and Burgeſſes to attend the Parliament,
it is ſaid expreſſely, firſt that the King reſolveth
upon weighty motives touching the weal and

Parliament,<note n="e" place="margin">Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtroak in the courſe of Parliaments, that no law

the recital of the writ by the Author of the Book

it is not to be found at what time the <hi>Clergie</hi> loſt
their place and <hi>vote</hi> in Parliament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may reaſonably be preſumed that they
had never any there: and 2ly. that if they had
been called <hi>ad conſentiendum</hi> (though no more
than ſo) we ſhould have found more frequent
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114881:110"/>
mention of their conſent unto the Acts &amp; Statutes
in our printed Books. For anſwer unto which it
may firſt be ſaid, that to ſuppoſe the Clergie had no
voice in Parliament, becauſe it is not to be found
when they loſt that Privilege, is ſuch a kind of
Argument (if it be an argument) as is made by
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Bellarm. de Eccl. lib. 4. cap. 5.</note> to prove that many of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are neither
terroneous nor new, becauſe we cannot ſay
expreſſely, <hi>quo tempore, quo autore,</hi> when and by
whoſe promoting they firſt crept in. And though
we cannot ſay expreſſely when the <hi>inferiour Clergy</hi>
loſt their place in Parliament, in regard it
might be loſt by <hi>diſcontinuance</hi> or <hi>non-uſage;</hi> or
that the clauſe was pretermitted for ſome ſpace
of time the better to diſuſe them from it; or
that they might neglect the ſervice in regard of
their attendance in the Convocation, which gave
them power and reputation both with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people: yet I have reaſon to beleeve, that
this pretermiſſion and diſuſe did chiefly happen
under the government of the Kings of the houſe
of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who being the true heirs and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> caſt many a longing
eye on the Church revenues, and hardly were
perſwaded to abſtain from that height of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
which <hi>Henry</hi> the 8 did aftercome to. And this
I am induced to beleeve the rather, in regard
that in the <hi>confirmation</hi> of the Churches rights ſo
ſolemnly confirmed and ratified in all former
<hi>Parliaments;</hi> there was a clog put to or added
in theſe times, which ſhaked the Fabrick:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114881:111"/>
the confirmation being firſt of ſuch rights and
<hi>liberties as were not repealed,</hi> 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. &amp; 4
<hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and afterwards of ſuch as <hi>by the
Common law were not repealeable,</hi> 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.
which might go very far indeed. And ſecondly
I find that in the 8 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was paſſed, that all the Clergy <hi>called to</hi>
Convocation <hi>by the Kings writ, and their</hi> ſervants
<hi>and Family ſhall for ever hereafter fully uſe and enjoy
ſuch</hi> liberty <hi>and defence in comming tarrying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
as the</hi> great men <hi>and</hi> Comminalty of <hi>the
Realm of</hi> England <hi>called to the Kings</hi> Parliament
<hi>do enjoy,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">8 Hen. 6. cap. 1.</note> &amp;c. Which being an unneceſſary care
or caution when the <hi>Clergie</hi> had their voice in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> and very neceſſary to be taken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
if they had never had ſuch <hi>voice:</hi> makes
me conceive, that it was much about this time
that they loſt that privilege. But this I leave as
a conjecture, and no more than ſo. For anſwer
to the ſecond argument, that if they had been
called of old <hi>ad conſentiendum,</hi> we ſhould have
found more frequent mention of their conſent
unto the Acts and Statutes of the former times;
beſides that it is a <hi>negative</hi> proof, and ſo <hi>non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent,</hi>
it ſtrikes as much againſt the preſence
and conſent of the <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> in the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Parliaments, as it can do againſt the <hi>Clergie.</hi>
For in the elder Parliaments under K. <hi>Henry</hi> 3.
and K. <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt there is no mention of the
<hi>Commons</hi> made at all, either as preſent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting;
nor much almoſt in all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
till K. <hi>Henry</hi> 7. but that they did petition
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114881:111"/>
for redreſſe of greivances, and that <hi>upon their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
inſtance and request</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">In the Proem to the ſeveral Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> ſeveral laws were
made for the behoof and benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth:
which part the <hi>Clergie</hi> alſo acted
in ſome former Parliaments, as before was
ſhewed. So that this negative Argument muſt
conclude againſt both or neither. But ſecondly
I anſwer, that in theſe elder times in which the
<hi>Proctors</hi> for the <hi>Clergy</hi> had their place in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
they are included generally in the name
of the <hi>Commons.</hi> And this I ſay on the authority
of the old <hi>modus tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> in which
the Commons are divided in the <hi>Spiritualty</hi> and
the <hi>Temporalty;</hi> and where it is expreſſely ſaid
that the <hi>Proctors for the</hi> Clergie, <hi>the Knights, the</hi>
Citizens and the Burgeſſes did repreſent the
whole <hi>Comminalty</hi> of the Realm of <hi>England</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. ult.</note>.
And this holds good in law (for ought I find
unto the contrary) to this very day. Certain I
am that <hi>Crompton</hi> in his book of the <hi>Iurisdiction of
Courts,</hi> where he fpeakes of Parliaments, doth
tell us that the Knights, Citizens, Burgeſſes, and
Barons of the Cinque ports,<note n="b" place="margin">Grompton Iuriſd. des. Courts. ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>ove le Clergie
qu' eux aſſemble au Pawles, repreſent le corps de tout le
Comminalty Dengliterre,</hi> together with the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
which aſſembled at S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> doe repreſent the
body of the whole Comminalty of <hi>England.</hi> So
then, the <hi>Clergie</hi> were not only called but were
preſent alſo, according to that clauſe in the
writ of Summons (which before I ſpake of) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to their ſeveral and reſpective Biſhops,
as the Kings ſpiritual Sheriffs, if I may ſo ſay,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114881:112"/>
inabled by the Laws to that end and purpoſe.
Which ſome endeavouring to avoid, have at laſt
found out that the clauſe before recited out of
the Writ to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> is not a calling of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> to attend in <hi>Parliament,</hi> but to command
them to attend in the <hi>Convocation:</hi> which I have
heard much preſſed by thoſe who pretend unto
ſome knowledge in the courſe of things. Which
though it be a groſs miſtake, and inconſiſtent
with the words and circumſtances of the VVrit
it ſelf, which relates meerly to the Parliament,
and buſineſs of a <hi>Parllamentarie</hi> nature: yet for the
clearing of the point, and undeceiving ſuch as
have been deceived, they may pleaſe to know,
that beſides this VVrit by which the <hi>Clergy</hi> are
commanded to appear in <hi>Parliament,</hi> there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
writ and another form of calling them
unto the ſervice of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> which is brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this. The King ſends out his VVrit or <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat</hi>
to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> requiring
him <hi>ſuper quibuſdam arduis &amp; urgentibus negotiis,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Regiſt. Warham.</note>. for divers great and weighty reaſons
concerning the Kings honour, the Churches ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the publick peace of his dominions, to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
all the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> Deans and Chapters, Arch-deacons,
and the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> of his Province to
meet in <hi>Convocation</hi> at a day and place appointed.
On the reception of which Writ the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſendeth out his <hi>Monitory</hi> to the Biſhop of
<hi>London</hi> (who by his place is <hi>Dean</hi> of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi>
College<note n="o" place="margin">Antiqu. Britan. in initio.</note>, and to diſperſe the <hi>Mandates</hi> of the
<hi>Metropolitan</hi>) requiring him to appear himſelf in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114881:112"/>
perſon, and to ſend out his warrant unto every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of the Province, to appear there alſo, and to
take order that the <hi>Deans</hi> of the Cathedrals, and
<hi>Arch-deacons</hi> perſonally, the Chapter by one <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator,</hi>
the Clergy of the Dioceſe by two, (whom
we uſually call <hi>Clerks of the Convocation</hi>) do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that ſervice (<hi>p</hi>).<note n="b" place="margin">Regiſt. Warham.</note>. VVhich comming to the
hands of each ſeveral Biſhop they do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give intimation to their Deans and Chapters,
to their Arch-deacons and the Clergy; and they
accordingly prepare themſelves to obey the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory,</hi>
and to return Certificate of their doings
in it. The like proceeding is obſerved alſo for
the Province of <hi>York.</hi> So that the calling of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> to the <hi>Convocation</hi> being by a different VVrit
and another form, which hath no reference to
nor dependance on the writs directed by the K.
to each ſeveral Biſhop for their attendance in the
Parliament, it muſt needs be (as I conceive it) that
by that clauſe remaining in the VVrits aforeſaid,
the <hi>Clergy</hi> have good right and title to a voice in
Parliament, though they have loſt their <hi>jus in re,</hi>
the benefit, the uſe and poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> 11. But I ſpeak this as once the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid
in another caſe, <hi>not by commandement but by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
For I perſwade my ſelf the <hi>Clergy</hi> do not
aim ſo high at the recovery of a right ſo long
antiquated and diſuſed, but would be well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
content with the reſtitution of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
to their <hi>vote</hi> in Parliament, of which they
ſtood poſſeſſed by ſo ſtrong a Title, as the very

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:114881:113"/>
laws of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> government could confer
upon them. For though the Biſhops ſate in
Parliament in their own <hi>perſonal capacities,</hi> and
not as the <hi>repreſentative</hi> body of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> yet
the poor <hi>Clergy</hi> found it ſome reſpect unto them

in that Court, wherein theſe <hi>heads</hi> had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of interceding, if perhaps any thing
were propounded which might be grievous to
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and many times a power of <hi>hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
and diverting if not by voice and numbers,
yet by ſtrength of reaſons. They were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Bond-men</hi> whileſt the Church
held that remnant of her antient rights; for
whileſt the <hi>heads</hi> retained that honor, the body
could not chooſe but rejoyce in it and be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
by it. But ſince they have been ſtripped
of that (by what unworthy Acts the world
knows too well) they are become of ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the moſt deſpicable Tradeſman in a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate</hi>
Town is more conſiderable in the eye of the
State, and hath a greater intereſſe in the affairs
thereof, than the greateſt <hi>Prelate,</hi> and to ſay truth
than all the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Realm. For being there
are three Ingredients which make up a Freeman
(as S. <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> well obſerved in his ſpeech
concerning the <hi>Poſt-nati</hi>) that is to ſay, 1. <hi>jus Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatis,</hi>
which did inable a man to buy and ſell,
and to take Inheritances; 2. <hi>jus ſuffragii,</hi> a voice
in the paſſing of Laws and Election of Officers;
and 3. <hi>jus honoris,</hi> a capability of ſuch offices
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114881:113"/>
and honors as the State could give him: the Clergy
by this means are limited to the firſt right only,
&amp; utterly excluded from the other two, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
put into a worſe condition, than the meaneſt
Freeman in the Kingdome. Inſomuch that
whereas every needy <hi>Artizan</hi> if he be free of any
<hi>Corporate</hi> Town or City, every <hi>Cottager</hi> that
dwelleth in an antient <hi>Burrough,</hi> and every <hi>Clown</hi>
which can lay claim to ſorty ſhillings <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
of free hold, either for life or of inheritance,
hath a voyce in Parliament, either in perſon or
by <hi>Proxie;</hi> and is not bound by any law but what
himſelf conſents to in his <hi>Repreſentatives:</hi> the
<hi>Clergy</hi> only of this Realm (as the caſe now ſtands)
being <hi>one of the greateſt States of this Kingdom,</hi> as is
acknowledged expreſly <hi>in terminis</hi> by Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">8 Eliz. c. 1.</note>, are neither capable of place there in
their perſonal capacities, nor ſuffered to be there
in their <hi>Procuratours,</hi> as of old they were; nor
have ſo much as any voice in chooſing of the
<hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> which repreſent the body of
the people generally. I know it hath been ſaid
in reply to this, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> may give voices
at the election of the <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> and
that it is their own neglect if they do it not. But
I know too, that this is only yielded unto ſuch
of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as are poſſeſſed oſ Lands and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in thoſe ſeveral places where ſuch elections
are to be made, and not then neither in moſt
places, except it be to make a party for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ends, eſpecially where ſome good man or the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:114881:114"/>
main cauſe it ſelf is concerned therein: which as
it totally excludeth the greateſt part of the <hi>Clergy</hi>
from having any voyce at all in theſe Elections,
(the greateſt part of the Clegy (the more
the pity) having neither Lands nor Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to ſuch a value in <hi>fee ſimple</hi>) ſo it gives no
more power unto thoſe that have, than what of
neceſsity muſt ſerve (I am ſure occaſionally it
may) to their own undoing. For to ſay truth,
thoſe that give out that the <hi>Clergy</hi> may give <hi>voice</hi>
at ſuch elections, uſe it but as a ſhift for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
turn: intending nothing leſs indeed (as hath
oft been ſeen) than that the <hi>Clergy</hi> ſhould be
capable of ſo great a truſt. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is not any <hi>Free-man</hi> of a City or a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
town who hath a voice in the election
of a <hi>Citizen</hi> to ſerve in Parliament, nor almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Cottager</hi> or <hi>Free-holder</hi> who hath a voice in the
election either of a Knight or Burgeſſe, but is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
eligible to the place himſelf. Of Citizens &amp;
Burgeſſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more according as they find their ſtrength, and

And for the chooſing of the Knights of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Shires, it is determined by the Statutes that
as 40 <hi>s.</hi> land of free-hold <hi>per Annum</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 7.</note>, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to qualifie a Clown for giving a voice at
the election; ſo the ſame Clown if he have 20l.
land <hi>per Annum</hi> is capable of being choſen for a
Knight of the Shire, as appears plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
by the Statute law. For though the writ
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114881:114"/>
directed to the ſeverall and reſpective Sheriffs
preſcribe a choice of <hi>duos milites gladio cinctos;</hi> yet
we know well that by the Statute of King <hi>Henry</hi>
6. which is explanatory in this caſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
law, <hi>ſuch notable</hi> Eſquires <hi>or</hi> Gentlemen,
<hi>born of the ſame Counties, as ſhall be able to be Knights</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">23 Hen. 6. 15.</note>, are made as capable as a <hi>dubbed Knight</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that ſervice; and he that hath no more
than 20 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> either in <hi>Capite</hi> or <hi>Socage</hi> is
not only <hi>able</hi> by the law <hi>to be</hi> made a <hi>Knight</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">1 Ed. 2. c. 1.</note>, but

clear enough (for there have been of late ſome
experiments of it) that though a <hi>Clergy</hi>-man
be born an Eſquire or Gentleman (for they are

queſtion exceeding weighty in it ſelf, but not ſo
much as thought of in this great <hi>disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement,</hi>
the ſlavery obtruded lately on the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Clergy: that is to ſay, <hi>whether that any two
of the</hi> three Eſtates <hi>conſpiring or agreeiug together
can conclude on any thing unto the prejudice of the</hi>

                  <note n="z" place="margin">Bodin. de Rep. l. 3. c. 7.</note>, that nothing can be done by two
of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> to the diſprofit of the <hi>third,</hi> in caſe
the point propoſed be ſuch as concerns them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally.
The point was brought into debate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occaſion. <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. of <hi>France</hi> had
ſummoned an Aſſembly of the <hi>three Eſtates</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus
Ordinum</hi> to be held at <hi>Bloys, Anno</hi> 1577.
(The form and order of the which we have at

that he could not bring his ends about ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with that numerous body, as if they were
contracted to a narrower compaſs, he cauſed it to
be mov'd unto them that they ſhould make choice
of 36, twelve of each Eſtate, <hi>quos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom the King would deign call to counſail
for the diſpatch of ſuch affairs and motions as
had been either moved or propoſed unto him.
Which being very readily aſſented to by the
<hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobility,</hi> who hoped thereby to
find ſome favour in the Court, and by degrees
to be admitted to the <hi>Privy Counſel,</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earneſtly oppoſed by <hi>Bodinus,</hi> being then
Delegate or Commiſsioner for the Province
of <hi>Veromandois,</hi> who ſaw full well that if bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
were ſo carried, the <hi>Commons</hi> (which
made the <hi>third Eſtate,</hi>) would find but little
hopes to have their grievances redreſſed, their
petitions anſwered.<note n="b" place="margin">Bodin. de Rep. l. 1. c. 7</note> And therefore labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the reſt of the Commiſsioners not to yield
unto it, as being utterly deſtructive of the
Rights and Liberties of the Common people:
which having done, he was by them intruſted
to debate the buſineſs before the other <hi>two
Estates,</hi> and did it to ſo good effect, that at the
laſt he took them off from their reſolution, and
obtained the cauſe. What Arguments he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in particular, neither himſelf nor <hi>Thuanus</hi>
telleth us. But ſure I am that he inſiſted both
on the antient cuſtomes of the Realm of <hi>France,</hi>
as alſo of the Realms of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
and the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> in each of which it was
received for a <hi>ruled</hi> caſe, <hi>nihil a duobus ordinibus
ſtatui poſſe, quo uni ex tribus prejudicium creare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
that nothing could be done by any of the
two Eſtates unto the prejudice of the third.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114881:116"/>
And if it were a <hi>ruled</hi> caſe, then in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> there is no reaſon why it
ſhould be otherwiſe in the preſent times, the
equity and juſtice of it being ſtill the ſame, and
the ſame reaſons for it now as forcible, as they
could be then. Had it been otherwiſe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of in the former ages, wherein the <hi>Clergy</hi>
were ſo prevalent in all publique Counſails,
how eaſie a matter had it been for them either
by joyning with the <hi>Nobility</hi> to exclude the
<hi>Commons,</hi> or by joyning with the <hi>Commonalty</hi>
to exclude the <hi>Nobles?</hi> Or having too much
conſcience to adventure on ſo great a change,
an alteration ſo incompatible and inconſiſtent
with the Conſtitution of a Parliament; how
eaſily might they have ſuppreſſed the <hi>potency,</hi>
and impaird the <hi>Privileges</hi> of either of the other
two, by working on the humours or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the one to keep down the other? But
theſe were Arts not known in the former daies,
nor had been thought of in theſe laſt, but by
men of <hi>ruine,</hi> who were reſolved to change
the Government (as the event doth ſhew too
clearly) both of Church and State. Nor
doth it help the matter in the leaſt degree, to
ſay that the excluſion of the Biſhops from the
Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> was not done meerly by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the two other Eſtates, but by the aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t
of the King, of whom the Laws ſay <hi>he can do no

For we know well in what
condition the King was when he paſſed that
<hi>Act,</hi> to what extremities he was reduced, on
what terms he ſtood, how he was forced to flye
from his City of <hi>London,</hi> to part with his dear
Wife and Children, and in a word ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
by the prevailing party in the two
Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that it was not ſafe for
him (as his caſe then was) to deny them any
thing. And for the Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gained, beſides that the Bill had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

and that the greater part of the Lords were
frighted out of the Houſe, when contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the courſe of <hi>Parliament</hi> it was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
it is a point reſolved both in Law and

And this the rather in regard it is thought of late,
and (more than thought) preſented to the world
in ſome publick writings, (eſpecially as it relates
to the Realm of <hi>England</hi>) that the King, the
Lords, and Commons, make the <hi>three Estates:</hi>
which brings the King into an equal rank with
the other two in reference to the buſineſſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs

ſoever it was broached and publiſhed,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:114881:118"/>
which hath no conſiſtence either with truth, or
ordinary obſervation, or with the practice of

that they become guilty of perfidious diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

we read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> touching the

the</hi> three Eſtates <hi>of the Realm of</hi> England, did

This makes it evident, that the King was not
accounted in the times before for one of the <hi>three

the preſent times. For conſidering that the <hi>Lords</hi>

the Doctrine of the preſent times, or elſe
the King is none of the <hi>Eſtates,</hi> as indeed he is not,
which was the matter to be proved. But I ſpend
too much time in confuting that which hath ſo
little ground to ſtand on, more than the <hi>dangerous
conſequences</hi> which are covered under it: For if the
King be granted once to be no more than one of
the <hi>three Eſtates,</hi> how can it chooſe but follow from
ſo ſad a <hi>Principle,</hi> that he is of no more power and
conſideration in the time of <hi>Parliament,</hi> than the
Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> which ſometimes hath conſiſted of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114881:120"/>
three Lords, no more; or than the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
only, which hath many times conſiſted of no
more than 80 or an hundred Gentlemen: but of
far leſſe conſideration to all intents and purpoſes
in the Law whatever, than both the <hi>Houſes</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together. What elſe can follow hereupon
but that the King muſt be <hi>co-ordinate</hi> with his
two Houſes of Parliament, and if <hi>co-ordinate,</hi>
then to be over-ruled by their Joynt concurrence,
bound to conform unto their Acts, and confirm
their <hi>Ordinances;</hi> or upon caſe of inconformity
and <hi>non-complyance</hi> to ſee them put in execution
againſt his liking and conſents, to his foul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
And what at laſt will be the iſſue of this
dangerous conſequence, but that the <hi>Lords</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themſelves to come down to the <hi>Commons,</hi>
and the King be no otherwiſe eſteemed of than
the chief of the Lords, the <hi>Princeps Senatus</hi> if you
will, or the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> at the beſt no more,
which if Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> may be credited, as I
think he may in this particular, ſeems to have
been the main deſign of ſome of the moſt popular
and powerfull Members then ſitting with him,
for which I do refer the Reader to his book of
Speeches. Which dangerous conſequents whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were obſerved at firſt by theſe who
firſt ventured on the expreſſion, or were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
looked over, I can hardly ſay. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
I am, it gave too manifeſt an advantage to
the <hi>Antimonarchical</hi> party in this Kingdome, and
hardned them in their proceeding againſt their

no otherwiſe than as a <hi>Joynt-tenant</hi> of the

the examination of that power, which by our
Author is conferred on the <hi>three Estates:</hi> which
we ſhall find on ſearch and tryal to be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
according to the conſtitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in which they are. For where the Kings
are <hi>abſolute Monarchs,</hi> as in <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Bodin de Repub. l. 1. c.</note> the <hi>three Eſtates,</hi> have properly and
legally little more authority, than to adviſe their
King, as they ſee occaſion, to repreſent unto
his view their common grievances, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſuch remedies, for redreſſe therof, as to them
ſeem meeteſt, to canvaſs and review ſuch errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgements as formerly have paſſed in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Courts, and finally to conſult about, and
prepare ſuch laws as are expedient for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
In other Countries where the Kings are
more <hi>conditional,</hi> and hold their Crowns by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
and agreement betweeen them and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
the reputation and authority of the <hi>three
Estates</hi> is more high and eminent, as in <hi>Polonia,
Danemark,</hi> and ſome others of the <hi>Northern</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
where the <hi>Estates</hi> lay claim to more than
a <hi>directive power,</hi> and think it not enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
their King, unleſs they may diſpoſe of the

we will look backwards on the condition

being inſtituted and ordained by the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
may ſerve to be a leading caſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

not ſhewn before, that as he makes the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>

Kingdomes as are under the command of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

Realm of <hi>France,</hi> the government whereof is meerly
<hi>Regal,</hi> if not <hi>deſpotical,</hi> ſuch as that of a Maſter over

liſt, according to the counſel of his own mind. For
in his <hi>Arbitrary Edicts</hi> which he ſendeth abroad,
he never mentioneth the conſent of the People,
or the approbation of the Counſel, or the advice
of his Judges (which might be thought to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
too much from his <hi>abſolute</hi> power) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all of them in this <hi>Regal</hi> form, <hi>Car tel eſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
plaiſir,</hi> for ſuch is our pleaſure. And though
the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> do uſe to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to peruſe his <hi>Edicts,</hi> before they paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
for<note n="d" place="margin">View of France by Dallington.</note> Laws, and ſometime to demurr
on his grants, and patents, and to petition him
to reverſe the ſame, as they ſee occaſion; yet
their peruſal is a matter but of meer <hi>formality,</hi> and
their demurs more dilatory than effectual. It is
the <hi>Car tel eſt noſtre plaiſir</hi> that concludes the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the Kings pleaſure is the Law which
that Court is ruled by. As for the <hi>Aſſemblie des
Eſtats,</hi> or <hi>Conventus Ordinum,</hi> it was reputed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
the Supreme Court for government and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of all the Kingdome; and had the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the greateſt and moſt weighty affairs
of State. But theſe meetings have been long
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:114881:125"/>
ſince diſcontinued, and almoſt forgotten: there
being no ſuch <hi>Aſſembly</hi> from the time of K. <hi>Charles</hi>
the eighth, to the beginning of the reign of K.
<hi>Charles</hi> the ninth,<note n="e" place="margin">Thuanus hiſt. ſui temp.</note> which was 70 years, and
not many ſince. And to ſay truth, they could be
but of little uſe, as the world now goeth, were the
meetings oftner. For whereas there are three
Principal, if not ſole occaſions of calling this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie,
or <hi>Conventus Ordinum,</hi> that is to ſay, the
diſpoſing of the <hi>Regency,</hi> during the nonage or
ſickneſs of the King, the granting <hi>aids</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies,
and the redreſs of the <hi>grievances:</hi> there is
now another courſe taken to diſpatch their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſpeaks
moſt commonly as it is prompted by power and
greatneſs, appointeth the <hi>Regent;</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Contin. Thuani. An. 1610.</note> the Kings

they that do complain of <hi>grievances</hi> may either
have recourſe to the Courts of juſtice, or elſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to the King for redreſs thereof. And for
the making new Laws or repealing the old, the
naturalization of the Alien, and the regulating
of his ſales or grants of the Crown-lands, the
publick patrimony of the Kingdome, which were
wont to be the proper ſubject and debates of theſe
<hi>grand Aſſemblies:</hi> they alſo have been ſo diſpoſed
of, that the <hi>Conventus Ordinum</hi> is neither troubled
with them, nor called about them. The <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of <hi>Accompts</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> (which hath ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

the Subjects law, and is as binding as any Act

of ſuch Laws as upon long experience are

which <hi>Bodinus,</hi> doth not only ſay in theſe general

                  <note n="k" place="margin">Bodin. de Rep. lib. 1. cap. 8.</note>. that many
times theſe Kings did abrogate ſome antient laws
without the calling and conſent of the <hi>three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates:</hi>
but ſaith, that it was neither new nor ſtrange
that they ſhould ſo do, and gives us ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
inſtances, not only of the later times but
the former ages. Nay when the power of this
<hi>Aſſemblie des Eſtats</hi> was moſt great and eminent,
neither ſo curtailled nor neglected as it hath been
lately; yet then they carried themſelves with the
greateſt reverence and reſpect before their King,
that could be poſſibly imagined. For in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
held at <hi>Tours</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. though
the King was then no more than 14 years of age,
and the authority of that Court ſo great and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that it was never at ſo high an eminence for
power and reputation, <hi>quanta illis temporibus,</hi> as
it was at that time: yet when they came before
the King, <hi>Monſeiur de Rell</hi> being then <hi>Speaker</hi> for
the <hi>Commons</hi> or the <hi>third Eſtate,</hi> did in the name of
all the reſt, and with as much humility and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as he could deviſe, promiſe ſuch duty and
obedience, ſuch a conformity of his will and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114881:126"/>
pleaſure, ſuch readineſs to ſupply his wants,
and ſuch alacrity in hearking unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
that as <hi>Bodinus</hi> well obſerves,
his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whole Oration was nothing elſe, <hi>quam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petua

but a conſtant teſtimony and expreſsion of
the good affections of the ſubject to their Lord
and Soveraign. But whatſoever power they
had in former times is not now material, King
<hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, having (on good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of State) diſcharged thoſe <hi>Conventions</hi> for
the time enſuing, Inſtead whereof he inſtituted
an Aſſembly of another temper, and ſuch as
ſhould be more obnoxious to his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
conſiſting of a certain number of perſons out
of each Eſtate, but all of his own nomination and
appointment, which joyn'd with certain of
his Counſel and principal Officers, he cauſed to
be called <hi>L' Aſſembly des Notables,</hi> aſſigning to them
all the power and privileges which the later Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of the three Eſtates did pretend unto;
right well aſſured that men ſo nominated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
would never uſe their powers to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment,

<hi>nec aliter Hiſpanorum conventus habentur,</hi> that the

                  <note n="m" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath more obedience
and obſervance from his <hi>three Estates,</hi> than that
which is afforded to the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> Which
being but general and comparative, is yet enough
to let us ſee that the Aſſembly of <hi>Estates</hi> in the
Realms of <hi>Spain,</hi> which they call the <hi>Curia,</hi> is very
obſervant of their King and obſequious to him,
and have but little of that power which is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by our Author to be inherent in the <hi>three Eſtates</hi>
of all the Chriſtian Kingdoms, But this <hi>Bodinus</hi>
proveth more particularly, aſcribing to the King,
and to him alone, the power of <hi>calling</hi> this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
when he ſees occaſion, and of <hi>diſſolving</hi> it
again when his work is done; according as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And when they
are aſſembled and met together, their Acts and
conſultations are of no effect, further than as they
are confirmed by the Kings conſent. Which
he declareth in the ſame form (<hi>eadem formulà
quâ apud nos</hi>) that hath accuſtomably been uſed
by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which is authoritative e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
that is to ſay<note n="n" place="margin">Id. ibid. p. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>decernimus, ſtatuimus, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus,</hi>
We will, and we appoint, and we have
decreed. The Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> though not ſo <hi>deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
in their Government as the <hi>French</hi> Kings are,
are as abſolute <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and have as great an
influence on the <hi>three Eſtates,</hi> to make them pliant
to their will, and to work out their own ends by
them, as ever had the <hi>French</hi> Kings on their
Courts of <hi>Parliament:</hi> a touch whereof we had
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114881:127"/>
before in the former Chapter. And this we may
yet further ſee by their obſervance of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of King <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d. Who having maried
the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. of

of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and his other Provinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> he
cauſed them to ſwear to the ſucceſſion of his Son
Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> whom he had by the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> and after having on ſome jealouſies of
State put that Prince to death, cauſed them to
ſwear to the ſucceſſion of another ſon by the Lady
of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And for the power of his Edicts, which
they call <hi>Pragmaticas,</hi> they are as binding to the
Subject as an Act of Parliament, or any kind of
Law whatever: examples of the which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obvious and familiar in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtories.
For though there be a body of Laws in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, partly made up of ſome old <hi>Gothiſh</hi>
Laws and Conſtitutions, and partly of ſome
parts of the <hi>Law imperial:</hi> yet for the explanation
of the Laws in force, if any doubt ariſe about
them, or for ſupplying ſuch defects which in the
beſt colllection of the Laws may occur ſometimes,
the Magiſtrates and Judges are to have recourſe
to the King alone, and to conform to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
as he gives them in it. And this is it
which was ordained by <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the tenth, <hi>qui etiam
magistratus ac judices</hi> Principem <hi>adire juſsit, quoties
patrio jure nihil de propoſita cauſa ſcriptum eſſet</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Bodin. de Rep. lib. 1. cap. 8.</note>, as
<hi>Bodinus</hi> hath it. 'Tis true that for the raiſing of
ſupplies of mony, and the impoſing of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:114881:127"/>
taxes upon the ſubject, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>
muſt be beholden to the <hi>three Estates,</hi> without
whoſe conſent it cannot legally be done. But
then it is as true withall, that there are cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tributes called <hi>Servitia</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Id. ibid. p. 90.</note> which the King
raiſeth of his own authority without ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
And their conſenting to the extraordinary
is a thing of courſe: the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation being ſo
well affected naturally to the power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Kings, whom they deſire to make
conſiderable if not formidable in the opinion of
their Neighbours, that the Kings ſeldome fail
of monies if the Subjects have it. Finally that

This was the form of holding Parliaments in

is wholly in the Kings power to frame the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to his own will, or at the leaſt to hinder it
from doing any thing to the prejudice of his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
Crown and Dignity: in that the nominating
of the <hi>Lords of the Articles</hi> did in a manner totally
depend on him. Which being obſerved by the

in the Kings Grants and Charters, he
may be underſtood of all Laws whatever. And
ſo much is collected out of <hi>Bractons</hi> words by the
L. Chancellor <hi>Egerton,</hi> of whom it may be ſaid
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:114881:130"/>
without envy, that he was as grave and learned a

is the new deviſe ſo much preſſed of late, of placing

time of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. King <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d. and

carried all before it. For neither have the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
or either of them enjoyed ſuch Soveraignty <hi>de
facto</hi> in times well ſetled, and <hi>Parliaments</hi> lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſembled, nor ever could pretend to the ſame
<hi>de jure.</hi> Or if they did, as many have been apt
enough to raiſe falſe pretences, it would much
trouble them to determine whether this <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi>
be conferred upon them by the King or the
people, whether it be in either of the Houſes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:114881:132"/>
or in both united. If they can challenge
this pretended <hi>Soveraignty</hi> in neither of theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,

be warrantably concluded that there is no ſuch
<hi>Soveraignty</hi> as they do pretend to. And firſt there
is no part nor branch of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> conferred
upon them by the King. The writs of Summons
which the <hi>Declaration of the Lords and Commons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaty. p. 15.</note>, tell us no ſuch
matter. The writ directed to the Lords doth
enable them only to confer and treat with one
another, <hi>&amp; conſilium vestrum impendere,</hi> and to
adviſe the King in ſuch weighty matters as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the ſafety of the Kingdom. But they are
only to adviſe, not compell the King, to counſell
him, but not controll him; and to adviſe and
counſel are no marks of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> but rather
works of ſervice and <hi>ſubordination.</hi> Nor can they
come to give this Counſel without he invite
them, and being invited by his writ cannot chooſe
but come, except he excuſe them: which are ſure
notes of duty and ſubjection, but very ſory ſigns
of power and ſoveraignty. 'Tis true, that being
come together they may and ſometimes do, on a
<hi>writ of Error,</hi> examin, and reverſe or affirm ſuch
judgements as have been given in the <hi>Kings Bench:</hi>
and from their ſentence in the caſe there is no
appeal, but only to the whole body of that Court,
the King and both the Houſes, the Head and
Members<note n="o" place="margin">Caſe of our Affairs. p. 7, 8.</note>. But this they do, not as the upper

that they are called to be partakers of the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi>

not the leaſt power of <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> Nor doth the
calling of a Parliament <hi>ex opere operato</hi> as you
know who phraſe it, either denude the King of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:114881:134"/>
the pooreſt robe of all his <hi>Royalty,</hi> or confer the

whether the King intend ſo by his call, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
For <hi>Bodin</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath honored
with the title of a <hi>grand Politician</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Pryn of Parliam. par. 2. p. 45.</note>) doth affirm

                  <note n="x" place="margin">Bodin. de Repub.</note>, that
the majeſty or <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of the King is not a
jot diminiſhed either by the calling of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or <hi>Conventus Ordinum,</hi> or by the frequency
and preſence of his <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> Nay to
ſay truth, the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Soveraign</hi> Princes is never
ſo tranſcendent and conſpicuous as when they
ſit in Parliament, with their States about them,
<hi>the King then ſtanding in his higheſt Estate,</hi> as was
once ſaid by <hi>Henry</hi> 8. who knew (as well as any
of the Kings of <hi>England</hi>) how to keep up the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
of the Crown Imperial. Nor can they claim
it from the people, who have none to give; for
<hi>nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> as the ſaying is. The King
(as hath been proved before) doth hold his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Crown immediately from God himſelf, not
from the contract of the people. He writes not
<hi>populi clementia,</hi> but <hi>Dei gratia,</hi> not by the favour
of the people, but by the <hi>grace of God.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and approbation of the people (uſed and not
uſed before the day of coronation) is reckoned
only as a part of the ſolemn pomps which are
then accuſtomably uſed. The King is actually King
to all intents and purpoſes in the Law whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
immediately on the death of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.
Nor ever was it otherwiſe objected in the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:114881:135"/>
Realm of <hi>England,</hi> till <hi>Clark</hi> and <hi>Watſon</hi> pleaded it
at their arraignment in the firſt year of King
<hi>James</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Speeds Hiſtory in K. James.</note>. Or grant we that the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of this
Kingdom was firſt originally in the people, and
by them devolved upon the King by their <hi>joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</hi>
yet having given away that power by their
ſaid <hi>conſent,</hi> and ſetled it upon the King by an
Act of State, confirmed by Oaths and all ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
which that Act requires; they cannot ſo
retract that grant, or make void that gift, as to
paſs a new <hi>conveyance</hi> of it, and ſettle it upon their
<hi>Repreſentees</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Commons.</hi> Or if they
could, yet this would utterly exclude all the
<hi>Lords</hi> from having the leaſt ſhare or portion in
this new found <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> in that they <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
not the common people, but ſit there only
in their own <hi>perſonal capacities,</hi> and therefore muſt
ſubmit at laſt to theſe new made <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> who
carry both the <hi>Purſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Sword</hi> at their own girdles.
So then the people cannot give the <hi>Soveraignty,</hi>
and if they have no power to give it, the <hi>Lords</hi>
and <hi>Commons</hi> have no claim thereunto <hi>de jure.</hi> See
we next therefore how much of this <hi>Soveraignty</hi>
they or their Predeceſſors rather have enjoyed <hi>de
facto,</hi> in peaceable and <hi>regular</hi> times, fit to be
drawn into example in the Ages following. The
chief particulars in which the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> conſiſts
we have ſeen before; and will now ſee whether

Or that a man who can pretend but to ſo much

Doctrine is become ſo dangerous, becauſe ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally

may chiefly be aſcribed unto this opinion, to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:114881:137"/>
which they have ſeduced the poor ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The rather in regard that ſome who have
undertook the confutation of theſe brainleſs ſolies,
have moſt improvidently granted not only<note n="h" place="margin">As in the book called Conſcience ſatisfied.</note> 
                  <hi>that

<hi>but that this</hi> coordination <hi>of the three Eſtates</hi> (of which

and held by the two Houſes on no worſe a title

to have. Therefore in Anſwer to the <hi>Fuller,</hi>
(not taking notice of his fooliſh and ſeditious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences)
we will clear thoſe points. 1. That the
two Houſes of Parliament are not <hi>coordinate</hi> with
the King, but <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to him; And 2. that
the power <hi>of making laws</hi> is properly and legally
in the King alone. As for the firſt we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>Recognition</hi> made by Act of Parliament, by
which the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> is acknowledged
to be an <hi>Empire governed by</hi> one ſupreme head and
King, <hi>to whom all ſorts and degrees of people ought to
bear</hi> next to God <hi>a natural and humble obedience</hi>

which certainly the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> had not

if any ſuch <hi>coordination</hi> had been then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
Or if it be ſuppoſed, to excuſe the matter,
that K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. being a ſevere and terrible
Prince did wreſt this <hi>Recognition</hi> from them
(which yet will hardly ſerve for a good defence:)

have eaſily regained it, and made up that breach

might be once admitted, it muſts needs follow,
that though the King hath no <hi>Superiour,</hi> he hath
many <hi>Equalls;</hi> and where there is <hi>Equality</hi> there is
no Subjection. But <hi>Bracton</hi> tells us in plain terms,
not only that the King hath no <hi>Superiour</hi> in his
Realm, except God almighty, but no <hi>Equal</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and the reaſon which he gives is exceeding
ſtrong, <hi>Quia ſic amitteret praeceptum, cum par in

the common Complement which the hypocriſie

happy a thing it was for the Realm of <hi>England</hi>
that this <hi>Fuller</hi> did not live in former times: For
had he broached this Doctrine ſome Ages ſince,
he would have made an end of Parliaments. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are very jealous of the ſmalleſt points of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,</hi>

proves not the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the State to be in

if the power of confirmation or rejecting be of a
greater truſt and more high concernment, than
that of <hi>conſulting</hi> and <hi>conſenting,</hi> as no doubt it is,
the power of <hi>conſulting</hi> and <hi>conſenting,</hi> which the

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> 10. This leads me on unto the power of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Laws,</hi> which as before I ſaid, is properly
and legally in the King alone, <hi>tanquam in proprio
Subjecto,</hi> as in the true and adequate ſubject of
that power. And for the proof thereof, I ſhall
thus proceed. When the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueror
firſt came in, as he wonne the Kingdom by the
ſword, ſo did he govern it by his power: His
<hi>Sword</hi> was then the <hi>Scepter,</hi> and his <hi>will</hi> the <hi>Law.</hi>
There was no need on his part, of an Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament;
much leſs of calling all the <hi>Eſtates</hi> together,
to know of them after what form, and by what
Laws they would be governed. It might as well
be ſaid of him, as in the flouriſh and beſt times of

                  </gap>, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>deſpotical</hi> power on the lives and fortunes
of their Subjects, which they diſpoſed of for the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:114881:139"/>
benefit of their friends and followers, <hi>Normans,
French,</hi> and <hi>Flemangs,</hi> as to them ſeemed beſt. But
as the Subjects found the yoke to be too heavy
and inſupportable; ſo they addreſſed themſelves
in their <hi>Petitions</hi> to the Kings their <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> to
have that yoke made eaſier, and the burden light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
eſpecially in ſuch particulars, of which they
were moſt ſenſible at the preſent time. By this
means they obtained firſt to have the Laws of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> contain'd for the moſt part in
the <hi>great Charter</hi> afterwards: and by this means,
that is to ſay, by powring out their prayers and
deſires unto them, did they obtain moſt of the
Laws and Statutes, which are now remaining
of the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. and King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the firſt. Many of which as they were iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the firſt either in form of <hi>Charters</hi> under the
Great Seal, or elſe as <hi>Proclamations</hi> of Grace and
favour; ſo do they carry ſtill this mark of their
firſt procuring, the <hi>King willeth,</hi> the <hi>King comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</hi>
the <hi>King ordaineth,</hi> the <hi>King provideth,</hi> the
<hi>King grants,</hi> &amp;c. And when the Kings were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to call their <hi>Eſtates</hi> together, it was not out of
an opinion that they could not give away their
power, or diſpence their favours, or abate any
thing of the ſeverity of their former government,

as much perhaps from their <hi>immediate

have asked ſome things which were as much
derogatory to the <hi>Lords</hi> (under whom they held)
as of their <hi>Soveraign</hi> Liege the King, the <hi>chief
Lord</hi> of <hi>all.</hi> In this reſpect, the <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
as well of the <hi>Prelates</hi> as the <hi>Temporal</hi> Lords,
was accounted neceſſary, in paſſing of all Acts
of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> to the people: becauſe that
having many <hi>Royalties</hi> and large immunities of
their own, a more near relation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and a greater intereſſe in the honour of
their Lord the King; nothing ſhould paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the prejudice and diminution of their own
Eſtates, or the diſabling of the King to ſupport
his Soveraignty. And this for long time was
the Stile of the following Parliaments, <hi>viz.</hi>

from the beginning of the Reign of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the third, till the beginning of the reign
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. ſave that ſometimes we
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:114881:140"/>
find the Lords <hi>complaining</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">10 Ed. 3. &amp;c.</note>, or <hi>petitioning</hi>

did require: and ſometime alſo no other
motive repreſented, but the Kings great deſire
to provide for the eaſe and ſafety of his people,
upon <hi>deliberation had with the</hi> Prelates <hi>and</hi> Nobles,
<hi>and learned men aſsisting with their mutual Counſell</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">23 Ed. 3.</note>. And all this while there is no queſtion to
be made, but that the power of making Laws
was conceived to be the chiefeſt flower of the
<hi>Royal Diademe,</hi> to which the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>
neither joynt nor ſeparate, did not pretend the
ſmalleſt Title more than <hi>petitioning</hi> for them, or
<hi>aſſenting</hi> to them: it being wholly left to the
Kings grace and goodneſs, whether he would
give ear or not unto their <hi>petitions,</hi> or hearken
unto ſuch <hi>adviſe</hi> as the <hi>Lords</hi> or other great men
gave him in behalf of his people. And this is
that which was declared in the Parliament by
the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> (and ſtill holds good as
well in point of Law as Reaſon) that it <hi>belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the</hi> regality <hi>of the King to grant or deny what

                  <hi>in</hi> Parliament <hi>he pleaſeth.</hi> But as
the Kings came in upon doubtfull Titles, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
were neceſſitated to comply with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
humours, (as ſometimes they were) ſo
did the <hi>Parliaments</hi> make uſe of the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for the increaſe of their authoritie, at
leaſt in the <hi>formalities</hi> of Law, and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of expreſsion. So that in the <hi>minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, unto thoſe uſual
words <hi>by the adviſe and aſſent of the Lords Spiritual
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:114881:140"/>
and Temporal, and at the ſpecial inſtance and requeſt of
the Commons</hi> (which were inſerted ordinarily into
the body of the Acts from the beginning of the
reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th.) was added this, <hi>By the
authority of the ſaid Parliament</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">3 Hen. 6. c. 2. &amp; 8 H. 6. 3. &amp;c.</note>. But ſtill it is to be
obſerved, that though thoſe words were added
to the former clauſe, yet the power of <hi>granting</hi> or
<hi>ordaining</hi> was acknowledged to belong to the
King alone; as in the places in the <hi>Margin,</hi> where
it is ſaid, <hi>Our Lord the King conſidering the premiſes,

ſtood, (but every general rule may have ſome
exceptions) till the beginning of the reign of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. about which time that uſual
clauſe, the <hi>ſpecial instance or requeſt of the Commons,</hi>
began by little and little to be laid aſide, and that
of their <hi>adviſe or aſſent</hi> to be inſerted in the place
thereof: for which I do refer you to the book at

the former ſtile, and that thoſe words <hi>By the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> did then pretend ſome
title unto the power of <hi>making laws:</hi> yet neither
<hi>adviſing</hi> or <hi>aſſenting</hi> are ſo <hi>operative</hi> in the preſent

unleſs it can be ſhewed, (as I think it

them, or did by any ſolemn Act of <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>

ſerve Parliaments, and what benefit can redound

words, <hi>much every way</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 3. 2.</note>. Many vexations often

King at other times uſeth the eyes and ears of
ſuch as have place about him, who may perhaps
be guilty of the wrongs which are done the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
but in a Parliament he ſeeth with his own
eyes, and heareth with his own ears, and ſo is in a

be otherwiſe. Nor do the people by the <hi>opportunity</hi>

their Prayers and petitions a redreſs of grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
only, but many times the King is overcome
by their <hi>importunity</hi> to abate ſo much of his power,
to grant ſuch points, and paſs ſuch Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
for their eaſe and benefit, as otherwiſe he
would not yield to. For certainly it is as true in
making our approaches and <hi>petitions</hi> to our Lord

come in queſtion, or any of his Officers are called
to a reckoning, they uſed heretofore to ſignifie
unto his Majeſty what they found therein, and he
accordingly either revoked his Grants, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed

of the final ſentence, if they went ſo far. So
that we may conclude this point with theſe

met in Parliament are of great authority, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
as they have improved it in theſe later
times; yet were they never of ſuch power, but that
the Kings have for the moſt part over-ruled them,
&amp; made them pliant &amp; conformable to their own
deſires: and this not only by themſelves, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo by their Judges, by their counſel often.
For ſuch was the great care and wiſdom of our
former Kings, as not to venture ſingle on that
numerous body of the two Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
whereby the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> might be ſo eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched;

and neither do, nor ſuffer wrong in point of

have diſpoſed of the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
of the Forts, Caſtles, Ports, and the <hi>Navie</hi>

againſt his liking: that they have depoſed ſome
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:114881:147"/>
Kings, and advanced others to the top of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Throne: And for the proof of this they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
examples out of the reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 3. K.
<hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and K. <hi>Richard</hi> the 2.<note n="e" place="margin">Prynnes Book of Parl. part. 2.</note> Examples, which
if rightly pondered, doe not ſo much prove the
<hi>power,</hi> as the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of Parliaments, in being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up and down by the privat conduct of every
popular pretender. For 'tis well known that the
Parliaments did not take upon them to rule, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to over-look K. <hi>Henry</hi> 3. but as they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who

yeeld unto what terms he pleaſed, and made the
Parliaments no other than a means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to put a popular gloſs on his wretched pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.
And 'tis well known that the enſuing
Parliaments which they inſtance in, moved not
of their own accord to the depoſing of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the 2. or King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. but ſailed as
they were ſteered by thoſe powerfull Counſels,
which Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> in the one, and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of

                  <note n="h" place="margin">2 Kings 10. 4.</note>? For
had it been an argument of the <hi>power</hi> of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they depoſed one King to ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
dethroned King <hi>Richard</hi> to advance the Duke
of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to the Regal diadem, they would
have kept the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in poſſeſſion of it,
(for the full demonſtration of a <hi>power</hi> indeed) and
not have caſt them off, at the firſt attempt of a
new plauſible pretender, declared them to be kings
in <hi>fact,</hi> but not in <hi>right,</hi> whoſe lawfull right they
had before preferred above all other titles, and
ſet the Crown upon the heads of their deadly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
In the next place it is objected that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
are a great reſtraint of the Soveraign
power (according to the Doctrine here laid down
by <hi>Calvin</hi>) in that the King can make no laws,
nor levy any money upon the Subject, but by the
counſel and aſſent of the Lords and Commons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in Parliament. But this objection hurts
as little as the former did. For Kings, to ſay the
truth, need no laws at all. In all ſuch points
wherein they have not <hi>bound</hi> themſelves by ſome
former laws made for the common uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Subject, they are left at <hi>liberty,</hi> and may
proceed in governing the people, given by God
unto them, according to their own diſcretion,
and the advice of their <hi>Counſel.</hi> New Laws are
chiefly made for the <hi>Subjects benefit,</hi> at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
on their importunate requeſts, for their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
profit; not one in twenty, nay, I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay not one in an hundred, made for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the King, either in the improvement
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:114881:148"/>
of his power, or the increaſe of his Revenue.
Look over all the Acts of Parliament, from the
beginning of the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. to the
preſent time, and tell me he that can, if he finds
it otherwiſe: Kings would have little uſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and leſs mind to call them, if nothing
but the making of new Laws were the matter
aimed at. And as for raiſing monies and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
taxes, it either muſt ſuppoſe the Kings to be
always unthrifts, that they be always indigent
and neceſſitous, and behind-hand with the world
(which are the ordinary effects of ill husbandry)
or elſe this argument is loſt, and of little uſe:
For if our Kings ſhould husband their eſtates to
the beſt advantage, and make the beſt benefit of
ſuch <hi>eſcheats</hi> and <hi>forfeitures</hi> &amp; <hi>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſcations</hi> as day by
day do fall unto them; If they ſhould follow the
example of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 7. and execute the <hi>penal Laws</hi>
according to the <hi>power</hi> which thoſe Laws have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, and the <hi>truſt</hi> repoſed in them by their
People; if they ſhould pleaſe to examine their
<hi>revenue,</hi> and proportion their expence to their
comings in, there would be litle need of ſubſidies
and ſupplies of money, more than the ordinary
aids and impoſitions upon Merchandize, which
the Law alloweth of, and the known <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi>
backed by <hi>preſcription,</hi> and long <hi>cuſtom</hi>
have aſſerted to them: So that it is by <hi>Accident,</hi>
not by right and nature, that the Parliament
hath any power or opportunity to reſtrain their
King in this particular; for where there is no
need of asking, there is no occaſion of denying;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:114881:149"/>
by conſequence no reſtraint upon, no baffle or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
offered to the <hi>Regal</hi> power. And yet
the <hi>Soveraign</hi> need not fear (if he be tollerably
carefull of his own eſtate) that any reaſonable
demand of his in theſe mony matters, will meet
with oppoſition or denial in his Houſes of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.
For whileſt there are ſo many Acts of
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> to be done in Parliament
(as what almoſt in every Parliament but an
enlargement of the Kings favours to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
and that none can be done in Parliament
but with the Kings <hi>fiat</hi> and conſent: there is no
queſtion to be made, but that the two Houſes of
Parliament will far ſooner chooſe to ſupply the
King (as allwiſe Parliaments have done) than
rob the Subject of the benefit of his grace and
favours, which is the beſt fruit they reap from
Parliaments. Finally, whereas it is objected
(but I think it in ſport) that the old Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>
uſed to ſay, that he <hi>knew not what a Parliament
in</hi> England <hi>could not do;</hi> and that King <hi>Iames</hi> once
ſaid in a Parliament, that <hi>then there were</hi> 500
<hi>Kings,</hi> which words were took for a Conceſſion
that all were Kings as well as he in a time of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
they who have given us theſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do either miſ-underſtand their Authors, or
abuſe themſelves. For what the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi>
ſaid of Parliaments (though it be more than the
wiſeſt man alive can juſtifie) he ſpake of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
according as the word is uſed in its <hi>proper</hi>
ſenſe; not for the <hi>two Houſes,</hi> or for either of them
<hi>excluſive</hi> of the Kings preſence and conſent; but
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:114881:149"/>
for the <hi>ſupreme Court,</hi> for the higheſt Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
conſiſting of the Kings moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> and the
<hi>Repreſentees</hi> of the Commons; and then it will
not ſerve for the turn intended. And what
King <hi>James</hi> ſaid once in jeſt (though I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard it uſed in earneſt upon this occaſion)
was ſpoke only in deriſion of ſome daring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who laying by the modeſty of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
would needs be looking into the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi>
or finding errors and miſtakes in the
preſent Government, or medling with thoſe
<hi>Arcana imperii</hi> which former Parliaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
at diſtance, with the eye of reverence. But
certainly King <hi>James</hi> intended nothing leſſe
than to acknowledg a <hi>co-ordinative Soveraignty</hi>
in the two Houſes of Parliament, or to make
them his Co-partners in the <hi>Regal</hi> power. His
carriage and behaviour towards them in the
whole courſe of his Government, clearly ſhews
the contrary: there never being prince more
jealous in the points of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> nor more
uncapable of a <hi>Rival</hi> in thoſe points than
he.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> 14. But yet the main objection (which we
may call the Objection <hi>paramount</hi>) doth remain
unanſwered. For if the <hi>three Eſtates</hi> convened
in Parliament, or any other <hi>popular Magiſtrate,</hi>
whom <hi>Calvin</hi> dreams of, be ordaned by the
Word of God, as Guardians of the peoples

plainly ſaies they were; or that they know

And therefore he deſires to humble them and

Leſt the reproach or puniſhment which they

Now what St. <hi>Jerome</hi> tels us in the general on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is by St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> preſt particularly, with

                  <hi>both
Prieſts and Monks, and not to temporal men only,
which he declareth in the beginning, when he
ſaid,</hi> Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higheſt
powers: <hi>although thou be an Apoſtle, although
thou be an Evangeliſt, although thou be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
although thou be whatſoever thou art.</hi>
Which ſaid he gives this reaſon for it, <hi>that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is not overthrown by this ſubjection.</hi> If
no <hi>Apoſtle</hi> could pretend to an exemption from
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:114881:152"/>
thoſe common duties which Subjects owe unto
their Princes; then certainly the <hi>Pope</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to ſit in <hi>Peters Chair,</hi> and to challenge all
the priviledges which belonged unto him, muſt
needs be in as great ſubjection to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Emperor, as the Apoſtles were (in their times)
to any <hi>Heathen</hi> King. If thoſe things were
required of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> as he ſaies they
were, then muſt the <hi>Papal Clergie,</hi> (whether
they be <hi>Monaſticks</hi> or <hi>ſecular Priests</hi>) perform
thoſe duties, and yeeld that due obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe Kings and Princes under whom they
live, which are here required. But ſo it is, that
partly by ſtrong hand, and partly by taking their
opportunities in the darker Ages of the Church,
the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not only freed his Clergie from
the power of Princes, in matters even of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
nature and concernment; but challengeth
for himſelf a power above them, and exerciſed
it for a long time with great pride and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
contrary to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Rule and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
Commentary. If no <hi>Evangelist</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
could challenge any ſuch exemption as the
<hi>Father</hi> plainly ſaith they could not; then much
leſſe can the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter pretend unto
it, though he be both a <hi>Prophet</hi> and an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist</hi>
alſo in his own conceit. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
the <hi>Scottiſh Presbyterians</hi> had got unto
ſo great a head in the minority of King <hi>James,</hi>
in all matters, which related to Eccleſiaſtical cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
(and to that cognizance they reduced
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:114881:153"/>
all matters) they commonly declin'd the Kings
judgement, and his Courts of Judicature as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
incompetent; <hi>appealing</hi> from them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to their own <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> or to the next

ſtanding ſo wilfully to thoſe Appeals, that ſome
of them had like to have paid dear for it, (after
that Kings coming into <hi>England</hi>) if the King
had not been more mercifull to them, then they
deſerved at his hands. If <hi>no man whatſoever
he be,</hi> can lawfully acquit himſelf from this
ſubjection as is ſaid by <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> what will
become of <hi>Calvins popular Magiſtrates,</hi> and of
the great authority which he gives them over

St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by which laſt the <hi>Supreme Powers,</hi>
whatſoever they be, are called the <hi>Ordinance of
God. The Powers</hi> (ſaith that Apoſtle) are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God, and therefore he that <hi>reſisteth
the Powers reſiſteth the</hi> Ordinance <hi>of God.</hi> Upon
which words <hi>Deodate</hi> gives this Gloſſe or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the <hi>ſupreme Powers</hi> are called the
<hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> becauſe God is the Author
of this Order in the world: and all thoſe who
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:114881:156"/>
attain to theſe Dignities, do ſo, either by his
manifeſt will and approbation, when the means
are lawfull: or by his <hi>ſecret</hi> Providence by
meer permiſſion or toleration, when they are
unlawfull. Now it is fitting that man ſhould
approve and tolerate that which God approves
and tolerates."</q> But thirdly, I conceive that
thoſe words in the Greek Text of St. <hi>Peter,
viz.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are not ſo properly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
as they might have been; and as the
ſame words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are rendred by the ſame
<hi>Tranſlators</hi> (ſomewhat more neer to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal)
in another place. For in the 8. chapt. to
the <hi>Romans</hi> verſ. 22. we finde them rendring
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the <hi>whole Creation</hi> (and why not
rather <hi>every Creature,</hi> as both our <hi>old Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> read it, conform to <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Creatura</hi> in the vulgar <hi>Latine?</hi>) which had
they done and kept themſelves more near to the
<hi>Greek</hi> Original in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Text, they either
would have rendred it by <hi>every humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> do; or rather by <hi>all Men,</hi> or
by <hi>all Man-kinde,</hi> as the words import. And
then the meaning will be this, that the <hi>Jewes</hi>
living <hi>ſcattered</hi> and <hi>diſperſt</hi> in <hi>Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia,</hi> and other Provinces of the Empire,
were to have their converſation ſo meek and
lowly (for fear of giving ſcandal to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
amongſt whom they lived) as to ſubmit
themſelves to all <hi>Man-kinde,</hi> or rather to <hi>every
Man</hi> (unto every <hi>humane Creature,</hi> as the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
read it) that was in Authority above, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:114881:157"/>
it were unto the Emperor himſelf, as their
ſupreme Lord, or to ſuch Legats, Prefects, and
Procurators, as were appointed by him for the
government of thoſe ſeveral Provinces, to the
end that they may puniſh the <hi>evil-doers,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
ſuch as <hi>did well,</hi> living comformably to
the Lawes by which they were governed. Small
comfort in this Text, as in any of the reſt before,
for thoſe <hi>popular Officers</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> makes
the Overſeers of the ſoveraign Prince, and
Guardians of the Liberties of the common
people.</p>
               <p>If then there be no Text of Scripture, no
warrant from the word of God by which the
<hi>popular Officers,</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> dreams of, are
made the Keepers of the Liberties of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, or veſted with the power of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Kings and ſoveraign Princes as often as
they wantonly inſult upon the people, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
infringe their Priviledges: I would fain
learn how they ſhould come to know that they
are veſted with ſuch power, or truſted with the
defence of the Subjects Liberties (<hi>cujus ſe Dei
ordinatione Tutores poſitos eſſe norunt</hi>) as <hi>Calvin</hi>
plainly ſaies they do. If they pretend to know it
by <hi>inſpiration,</hi> ſuch <hi>inſpiration</hi> cannot be known
to any but themſelves alone; neither the Prince
or people, whom it moſt concerneth, can take
notice of it. Nor can they well aſſure themſelves
whether ſuch <hi>inſpirations</hi> come from God or
the Devil; the Devil many times inſnaring
proud ambitious and vain-glorious Men by ſuch
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:114881:157"/>
ſtrange Deluſions. If they pretend to know it
by the Dictate of their <hi>private Spirit</hi> (the <hi>great
Diana</hi> of <hi>Calvin</hi> and his followers in expounding
Scripture) we are but in the ſame uncertainties,
as we were before. And who can tell whether
the <hi>private Spirit</hi> they pretend unto, and do
ſo much brag of,<note place="margin">1 King. 22. 22.</note> may not be ſuch a <hi>lying Spirit
as was put into the mouthes of the Prophets,</hi> when
<hi>Ahab</hi> was to be ſeduced to his own deſtruction?
<hi>Adeo Argumenta ex abſurdo petita ineptos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
exitus,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> notes it.</p>
               <p>All I have now to add, is to ſhew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Calvin</hi> and his followers, in the
propounding of this Doctrine; delivered by
<hi>Calvin</hi> in few words, but <hi>Magiſterially</hi> enough,
and with no other Authority then his <hi>ipſe dixit;</hi>
enlarged by <hi>David Paraeus</hi> in his Comment on
the 13. chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> into divers bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and many endevours uſed by him (as by
the reſt of <hi>Calvins</hi> followers,) to finde out Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and inſtances out of ſeveral Authors to
make good the cauſe. For which though <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
ſcap'd the fire, yet <hi>Paraeus</hi> could not. <hi>Ille
Crucem pretium ſceleris tulit, hic Diadema.</hi> For
ſo it hapned, that one Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Brodegates</hi>
(now <hi>Pembroke Colledge</hi>) in <hi>Oxford,</hi> had preach'd
up the Authority of theſe <hi>popular officers</hi> in a
Sermon before the Univerſity, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the year 1622. for which being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
tranſmitted to the King and Councel, he
there ingenuouſly confeſſed, that he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
both his Doctrine, and his proofs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:114881:158"/>
from the Book of <hi>Paraeus</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
Notice whereof being given to the
Univerſity, the whole Doctrine of <hi>Paraeus</hi> as to
that particular, was drawn into ſeveral <hi>Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
which in a full and frequent <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
held on the 25. of <hi>June,</hi> 1622. were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
condemned to be erroneous, ſcandalous,
and deſtructive of Monarchical Government.
Upon which Sentence or determination, the
King gave order that as many of thoſe books as
could be gotten, ſhould ſolemnly and publickly
be burnt in each of the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church-yard, which was done accordingly.
An accident much complained of by the Puritan
party for a long time after, who looked upon it
as the funeral pile of their Hopes and Projects;
till by degrees they got freſh courage, carrying
on their deſigns more ſecretly, by conſequence
more dangerouſly then before they did. The
terrible effects whereof we have ſeen and felt in
our late <hi>Civil Wars</hi> and preſent confuſions. But
it is time to cloſe this point, and come to a
concluſion of the whole Diſcourſe; there be no
other Objections that I know of, but what are
eaſily reduced unto thoſe before, or not worth
the Anſwering.</p>
               <p>15. Thus have we took a brief <hi>Survey</hi> of
thoſe inſinuations, grounds or <hi>Principles</hi> (call
them what you will) which <hi>CALVIN</hi> hath
laid down in his Book of <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> for the
incouragement of the Subjects to rebellious
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:114881:158"/>
courſes, and putting them in Arms againſt
their Soveraign, either in caſe of <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs,
or <hi>Mal-adminiſtration,</hi> of what
ſort ſoever; by which the Subjects may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that they are oppreſſed either in point of
<hi>liberty,</hi> or in point of <hi>property.</hi> And we have
ſhewn upon what falſe and weak foundations
he hath raiſed his building; how much he hath
miſtook or abuſed his Authors; but how much
more he hath betrayed and abuſed his Readers.
For we have clearly proved, and directly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
out of the beſt Records and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the former times, that the <hi>Ephori</hi>
were not inſtituted in the State of <hi>Sparta</hi> to
oppoſe the <hi>Kings;</hi> nor the <hi>Tribunes</hi> in the
State of <hi>Rome</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Conſuls;</hi> nor the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchi</hi>
in the Common-wealth of <hi>Athens</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>Senate:</hi> or if they were, that this could
no way ſerve to advance his purpoſe of ſetting up
ſuch <hi>popular Officers</hi> in the Kingdoms of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
thoſe <hi>Officers</hi> being only found in <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craties,</hi>
or <hi>Democraties,</hi> but never heard or
dreampt of in a <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government. And
we have ſhewn both who they are which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
the <hi>three Eſtates</hi> in all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and that there is no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Kingdom in
which the <hi>three Eſtates</hi> convened in Parliament
(or by what other name ſoever they do call
them) have any authority either to regulate the
perſon of the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Prince, or reſtrain his
power, in caſe he be a <hi>Soveraign</hi> Prince, and not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:114881:159"/>
meerly titular and conditional; and that it is not
to be found in Holy Scripture, that they are or
were ordained by God to be the <hi>Patrons</hi> and
<hi>Protectors</hi> of the Common people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
chargeable with no leſſe a crime than a
moſt <hi>perfidious Diſsimulation, ſhould they connive
at</hi> Kings <hi>when they play the</hi> Tyrants, <hi>or want only</hi>
abuſe that power which the Lord hath given them,
to the oppreſſion of their Subjects. In which
laſt points, touching the deſignation of the
<hi>three Eſtates,</hi> and the authority pretended to
be veſted in them, I have carried a more particular
eye on this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> where thoſe <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Principles</hi> and inſinuations which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
gives us, have been too readily imbraced, and
too eagerly purſued by thoſe of his party and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
If herein I have done any ſervice to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, my Countrey and ſome miſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Zelots of it, I ſhall have reaſon to rejoyce in
my undertaking. If not, poſterity ſhall not ſay
that <hi>Calvins</hi> memory was ſo ſacred with me, and
his name ſo venerable, as rather to ſuffer ſuch a
<hi>Stumbling-block</hi> to be laid in the Subjects way
without being <hi>cenſured</hi> and <hi>removed,</hi> than either
his authority ſhould be brought in queſtion, or
any of his <hi>Dictates</hi> to a <hi>legal</hi> tryal. Having been
purchaſed by the Lord at ſo dear a price, we are
to be no longer <hi>the Servants of men,</hi> or to <hi>have the
truth of God with reſpect of perſons.</hi> I have God to
be my Father, and the Church my Mother, and
therefore have not only pleaded the Cauſe of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:114881:159"/>
Kings and Supreme Magiſtrates who are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of <hi>God,</hi> but added ſomewhat in behalf of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
I have pleaded to my beſt abilities. The
iſſue and ſucceſs I refer to him by whom <hi>Kings</hi>
do <hi>reign,</hi> and who appointed <hi>Kings,</hi> and other
Supreme Magiſtrates <hi>to be nurſing Fathers</hi> to his
Church; that as they do receive authority and
power from the hands of God, ſo they may uſe
the ſame in the protection and defence of the
Church of God: and <hi>God, even their own God
will give them his Bleſsing,</hi> and ſave them from the
<hi>ſtriving of unruly people,</hi> whoſe mouth ſpeaketh
proud words, and their <hi>right hand is a right hand
of iniquity.</hi>
