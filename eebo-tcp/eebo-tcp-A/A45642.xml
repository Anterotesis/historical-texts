         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM X. 4.</bibl>
               <q>The Wicked through the Pride of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
will not seek after God: Neither is
God in all his Thoughts.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Psalm is Contained a very lively De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Insolence of Atheistical and
Wicked Men, when once they grow Powerful
and Numerous; for then, as we read at the
Third Verse, they will proceed so far, as openly <hi>to
boast of and glory in</hi> their Impiety: They will boldly
<hi>defie and contemn the great God</hi> of Heaven and Earth,
v. 13. They will <hi>deny his Providence,</hi> v. 11. <hi>and despise
his Vengeance:</hi> And, as we are told in these words of
my Text, They will grow so Proud and high, as to
scorn to pay him any Honour or Worship, to Pray
to him or <hi>Call upon him;</hi> but will endeavour to
banish the very Thoughts of his Being out of their
Minds. <hi>The Wicked through the Pride of his,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words, we have an Account more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
by what <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Steps</hi> Men advance
to such an Exorbitant height of Wickedness, as to
set up for Atheism, and to deny the Existence of a
God; for there are in them these Three Particulars,
which I shall consider in their Order.</p>
            <p>I. Here is the general Character or Qualifications
of the Person the Psalmist speaks of; which
is, That <hi>he is a Wicked Man. The Wicked
through the Pride,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59819:5"/>
II. The <hi>particular kind of Wickedness,</hi> or the <hi>Origin</hi>
from whence the Spirit of Atheism and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
doth chiefly proceed; And <hi>That is Pride.
The Wicked through the Pride of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
&amp;c. And,</p>
            <p>III. Here is the <hi>great Charge</hi> that is brought against
this Wicked and Proud Man; viz. <hi>Wilful Atheism
and Infidelity: He will not seek after God: Neither
is God in all his Thoughts:</hi> Or, as it is in the
Margin of our Bibles, with good Warrant from
the Hebr. <hi>All his Thoughts are there is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In discoursing on the two First of these Heads,
I shall endeavour to shew, that <hi>Immorality</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi>
are the great Causes of the Growth of Atheism
amongst us: And on the Third, I shall consider the
Objections that Atheistical Men usually bring against
the being of a Deity, and shew how very weak and
invalid they are.</p>
            <p>And first I think it very Necessary to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>the Causes</hi> of Infidelity and Atheism, and to
shew how it comes to pass that Men can possibly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to so great a height of Impiety. This my Text
naturally leads me to, before I can come to the great
Subject I design to Discourse upon; and I hope it
may be of very good use to discover <hi>the Grounds</hi> of
this heinous Sin, and the <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Steps</hi> by which
Men advance to it; that so those who are not yet
hardened in it, nor quite given up to a Reprobate
Mind, may, by the Blessing of God, take heed, and
avoid being engaged in such Courses as do naturally
lead into it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59819:5"/>
I. Therefore let us consider the general Character
or Qualifications of the Person here spoken of in my
Text, And that is, that he is a <hi>Wicked Man. The
wicked through the Pride,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this is every where the Language of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scripture, when it speaks of Atheistical Men.
<hi>David</hi> tells us (<hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1. and 51. 1) that 'tis the
<hi>Fool</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> for so the word <hi>Nabal</hi>
often signifies, and is so <hi>here</hi> to be understood) 'Tis
he that hath said <hi>in his heart there is no God.</hi> 'Tis
such an one as is a <hi>Fool</hi> by his own fault; one stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
and dull'd by Vice and Lust, as he sufficiently
explains it afterwards; <hi>one that is corrupt and become
filthy, and that hath done abominable works.</hi> So the
Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> supposes, that those Men <hi>will have in
them an evil heart of unbelief,</hi> who do <hi>depart from
the living God,</hi> and <hi>live without him in the world.</hi>
And indeed, it is very Natural to conclude, That
those which are once debauched in their <hi>Practices,</hi>
may easily grow so in their <hi>Principles:</hi> For when
once 'tis a Man's Interest that there should be no
God, he will readily enough disbelieve his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence:
We always give our assent very precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly
to what we wish for, and would have to be
true. A Man oppressed with a Load of Guilt, and
conscious to himself, that he is daily obnoxious to
the Divine Vengeance, will be often very uneasie,
restless, and dissatisfied with himself, and his Mind
must be filled with Dismal and Ill-boding Thoughts.
He is unwilling to leave his Sins, and to forego
the present Advantage of Sensual Pleasure; and yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59819:6"/>
he cannot but be fearful too, of the Punishments
of a Future State, and vehemently disturbed now
and then, <hi>about the account that he must one day give
of his Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, 'tis very Natural for a Man under such
Circumstances, to catch at any thing that doth but
<hi>seem</hi> to offer him a little Ease and Quiet, and that
can help him to shake off his melancholy Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of impending Punishment and Misery. Some
therefore bear down all Thought and Consideration
of their Condition, in an uninterrupted enjoyment
of Sensual Delights, and quite stupifie and drown
their Conscience and Reason in continual Excesses
and Debauchery; and thus very many commence
Atheists, out of downright Sottishness and Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and come at last to <hi>believe</hi> nothing of the
Truths of Religion, because they never <hi>think</hi> any
thing about it, nor <hi>understand</hi> any thing of it.
Others, who have been a little enured to think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and have gotten some small smattering in the
superficial Parts of Learning, will endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their wicked Practices by some pretence to
Reason and Argument. These will one while justifie
their Actions, by forced and wrested Citations and
Explications of some particular Texts of Scripture;
at another time they will shroud themselves under
the Examples of the Prevarications of some great
Men in Sacred Scripture, as a Licence to them, to
be guilty of the same or the like wicked Acts;
without considering at all, of their great Penitence
afterwards. Sometimes they will dispute the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Hell Torments, deny that their Soul shall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59819:6"/>
survive the Body, and please themselves with the
glorious hopes of being utterly annihilated. Now
they will argue against the Freedom of their <hi>own
Wills;</hi> and by and by, against that of the <hi>Divine
Nature:</hi> and from <hi>both</hi> conclude, that there can be
no harm nor evil in what they do, because they
are absolutely necessitated to every thing they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
But against all this precarious stuff, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures do yet appear and afford a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Refutation. The next Step therefore must
be to <hi>quarrel</hi> at, and <hi>expose</hi> them; to pretend that
there are <hi>Absurdities, Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
in them: To assert that the Religion they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is nothing but a meer Human and Political
Institution, and the Invention of a Crafty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
Order of Men, to promote their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and Advantage; but that they are of no manner
of Divine Authority, nor Universal Obligation.
And when once they get thus far, they begin to
be at Liberty; now they can pursue their vicious
Inclinations without controul of their Consciences,
or the Conviction of God's holy Word, and are
got above the Childish Fears of Eternal Misery. By
this time, the true and through <hi>Calenture</hi> of Mind
begins; they grow now deliriously enamoured with
the feign'd Products of their own Fancies; and
these Notions appear to them now, adorned with
such bright and radiant Colours, and so beautiful
and glorious, that they will rush headlong into this
<hi>Fools Paradise,</hi> though Eternal Destruction be at
the bottom; for now they stick at nothing; They
Retrench the Deity of all his Attributes, absolutely
deny his Presidence over the Affairs of the World,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59819:7"/>
and make him nothing but a kind of <hi>necessary and
blind Cause of things, Nature, the Soul of the World,</hi>
or some such word, which they have happened to
meet with in the Ancient Heathen Writers. But
they Profess that 'tis impossible to have any <hi>Idaea</hi>
of him at all; and what they cannot conceive or
have an <hi>Idaea</hi> of, they say is <hi>nothing,</hi> and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
there can be no such thing as a God.
This, or such like, I'm perswaded is the usual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
by which these kind of Men advance to
absolute Infidelity and Atheism: And in this, they
are every step confirmed and established by the
seeming Wit, and real Boldness, with which Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
Men dress up their Arguments and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
and of which, if they were stripped and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested,
their weakness and inconclusiveness must needs
appear to every one. But the Mirth and Humour,
and that Surprising and Extravagant Vein of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which always abounds in the Company of such
Men, so suits and agrees with his own vicious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
that he becomes easily prejudiced against
the Truth of Religion, and any Obligation to its
Precepts and Injunctions: And so he will soon
resolve <hi>to seek no more after God,</hi> but will employ all
his Thoughts to prove that there is no such Being
in the World.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, it appears wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for a Man to arrive at such a pitch as
absolute Infidelity and Atheism, if he hath been
virtuously Educated, and be enclined to live a Sober
and a Moral Life. For there is certainly nothing
that Religion enjoins, but what is exactly agreeable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59819:7"/>
to the Rules of Morality and Virtue; nothing but
what is conformable to right Reason and Truth;
nothing but what is substantially good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and nothing but what will approve it self to a
thinking Mind, as certainly conducing to the good
of Human Society, and to every one's Quiet, Ease,
and Happiness here in this Life: And over and above
this, it gives us an assurance of a glorious Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
in the World to come.</p>
            <p>Now, Can it be imagined, that any sober and
virtuous Man, and one that is not prejudiced by the
Inducements of Sensual Pleasure, if he seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
things, will not be induced to take upon
him the Profession of our holy Religion: and with
all due Gratitude to our Gracious God, accept of
so vast a Reward as this of Eternal Happiness?
Especially too when it is for doing that only out
of a <hi>true Principle of Religion,</hi> which it is supposed
he was inclined to perform without it, by the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reason and Honour.</hi> A Man that is enclined
to live virtuously, justly, temperately, and peaceably
in this present World, will soon be satisfied, if he
read the Holy Scriptures, that it is <hi>this</hi> which
lies at the Bottom of all Revealed Religion, and for
whose Advancement and Propagation among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
all that gracious Dispensation was contrived
and delivered to us. What reason can therefore be
possibly assigned, why such a Person should disbelieve
the <hi>Truths</hi> of Religion? Is not a desire of Happiness
so Natural to us, that 'tis the great Inducement of
all our Actions? and will not every Man aim to get
as much of this as he can, according to the Notion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59819:8"/>
he hath of it? what is there then that can prejudice
such a Man's Mind against the Belief and Expectation
of a future Reward at the hand of God? Is it not
Natural to embrace any offer that proposes to us a
great Advantage? and are not we very ready to
believe the Truth of any thing that is advanced of
that Nature? The Great Truths therefore of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
containing nothing impossible, absurd or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
in them, and exhibiting to him Infinite
Advantages on such easie Conditions, must needs
be the delightful Objects of a <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Virtuous</hi>
Man's Faith. He, indeed, that hath just Grounds
to fear that his Irregular Life will incapacitate him
for the Favour of God; and the Joys of another
World, may be willing, and at last infatuated so
far, as really to disbelieve what he knows he cannot
obtain. But one that is of a Moral, Sober and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Disposition, can never be supposed to be so
unaccountably absurd, as to commence Atheist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his <hi>Interest,</hi> his <hi>Inclination,</hi> and his <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as 'tis hardly possible to conceive a Person
can be an Atheist, without being first <hi>Wicked;</hi> so it
appears as difficult to imagine, that if he be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
he should not continue to be <hi>so.</hi> I know
the Contrary is often pretended; <hi>viz.</hi> That one that
believes nothing of a God or Religion, may yet be,
and often is guided by a Principle of <hi>Reason and
Honour, and will do to others as he would be done
unto himself:</hi> Such an one (<hi>it is said</hi>) will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of the Necessity of Humane Laws, and of the
Advantages that do thence arise to Mankind: He
will think himself obliged to submit to the Laws of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59819:8"/>
his Country, and consequently will keep up to the
Rules of common Justice and Honesty; and this (say
they) is enough, and all that Religion can pretend to
enjoin.<note n="a" place="margin">Pensees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses Ecrites à un Docteur de <hi>Sorbonne</hi> à l'Occasion de la Cométe qui pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rut au Mois de <hi>Decembre, 1680. Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> 8vo.</note> There is a late French Author, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to maintain by Arguments and Examples,
that the Principles of Atheism do not necessarily lead
to Vice and Immorality. But in the Proof of this,
he comes very short of his Design. He alledges,
That <hi>some</hi> Professing Christianity have always, and
do still, live as bad Lives and as wickedly as any
Atheists whatsoever can do: And that some Atheists
have lived very Regularly and Morally. But what
then? Allowing and granting all this; it doth
not in the least follow that Atheism doth not lead to
Immorality and a Corruption of Manners. For it is
neither asserted that Atheism is the <hi>only way</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Wicked; nor that an Atheist must necessarily
be guilty <hi>of all manner of Vice.</hi> No doubt very many
Men betake themselves to a sinful Course, without
having any Principles to justifie themselves by, as
the Atheist pretends to: But are drawn into Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
purely by Incogitancy and want of Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And such kind of Persons, though they make
an outward Profession of Christianity, yet they may
be, and doubtless often are, as Vicious and Immoral as
any other Men, without ever arriving at the Point of
<hi>Speculative Atheism,</hi> or perhaps without ever so much
as doubting of the Being of a God, of the Truth
of Religion, or of a Future State of Rewards and
Punishments. No one saith also that an Atheist must
necessarily be guilty of <hi>all manner of Vice and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:</hi>
But 'tis plain enough, that his Principles lead
him to prosecute <hi>any vicious Inclination</hi> that is suitable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59819:9"/>
to him, and to do <hi>any thing</hi> that he can safely, to
procure to himself that kind of Happiness or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
he proposes to enjoy. Many Sins are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to some particular Periods and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of a Man's Life, to his Constitution, Genius
and Humour. Now 'tis easie to suppose a Man may
abstain from <hi>such,</hi> for his own Ease, Health and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's
sake. <hi>Self-Love</hi> will preserve the Atheist from
such open and notorious Acts of Wickedness, as will
expose him to the Capital Punishment of Human
Laws; and which will endanger depriving him of
his Being here, where he only proposes to be happy.
This Principle also of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> will hinder him
from exposing himself to Ignominy and Scandal;
and will make him endeavour to keep fair in the
Opinions of those whose disesteem would give him a
great degree of Unhappiness. But it doth not in
the least follow from hence, that because he is not
guilty of <hi>all manner,</hi> or of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular
Vice, that therefore he is a good Moral Man, and
guilty of <hi>none at all:</hi> It cannot be concluded from
hence, that such a Person will avoid committing any
Fact, be it never so Wicked, when it is stript of all
these Inconveniences, and can be done secretly, safely
and securely: when 'tis agreeable to his Constitution
and Humour, fashionable and gentile, and contributes
very much to that kind of Satisfaction he is inclin'd
to; for as one that had consider'd this Point well,
observes, <hi>Self-Love, which like Fire covets to resolve
all things into it self, makes Men they care not what
Villany or what Impiety they Act, so it may but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to their own Advantage.</hi> (Preface to <hi>Great is</hi> Diana
<hi>of the</hi> Ephesians.) And indeed, if he be not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59819:9"/>
Stupid, and one that proposes to himself no
manner of End at all, he will certainly do this very
thing: He will pursue and practise Indifferently such
kind of Designs and Actions, be they good or bad,
as will give him as much Pleasure and Happiness as
he can have here in this short Life, where, Miserable
Wretch as he is, <hi>he only hath any hope.</hi> And nothing
can nor will hinder such a Person from endeavouring
to do or obtain any thing he hath a Mind to, but
the fear of being exposed to Punishment and Misery
<hi>here,</hi> from those among whom he lives. Now, this
Consideration can have no place in <hi>secret</hi> Actions,
and consequently nothing will hinder a Man of these
abominable Principles from committing the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Villany that is consistent with his Safety,
and subservient to his Desires; that can be either
concealed in Secresie, or supported by Power. For,
as to the <hi>Principle of Honour,</hi> that such Men will
pretend to be governed and guided by, and which
they would set up to supply the Room of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Religion; 'tis plain, that 'tis the veriest
Cheat in Nature: 'tis nothing but a meer abusive
Name, to gull the World into a Belief that they
have some kind of Principle to act and proceed by,
and which keeps them from doing <hi>an Ill Thing:</hi>
Whereas the Atheist can have no Principle at all,
but that sordid one of <hi>Self Love;</hi> which will still carry
him to the perpetrating of any thing indifferently,
according as it best conduces to his present Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and Advantage. They deny that there are
any Actions truly Good or Honourable, or Wicked
and Base in themselves; but that this is all owing
to the peculiar Customs, Laws, and Constitutions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59819:10"/>
of Places and Countries: And that as <hi>all Men</hi> are,
so <hi>Actions</hi> also, are naturally equal and alike: And
how far such Notions as these will carry Men,
'tis very easie both to <hi>Imagine</hi> and to <hi>Observe.</hi> One
would think nothing could be more Noble, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and Comely, than for a Man to stick
firm and constant to those Principles that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to, and by no means whatever to be brought
to abjure and deny them. <hi>Sincerity</hi> is so lovely
and desirable a Vertue, that it doth approve it
self, as it were naturally, to the reason of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
and 'tis equally Useful, nay, indeed Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
to the due Government of the World. But
this Noble Virtue, so peculiar to a Man of True
honour and greatness of Mind, the Atheist will
practise no longer than it is for his <hi>Interest</hi> and
<hi>Advantage,</hi> and while it is consistent with his
Safety. That Men may profess or deny any thing
to save their Lives, is the avowed Principle of
one of their great Writers. And the same is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
asserted in other words, even in lesser Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
than that of Danger of Death, by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator
of <hi>Philostratus</hi>'s Life of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi>
with a great Pretence to Wit and Humour. But
if Men may Lye and Prevaricate from so base and
abject a Principle as <hi>Fear,</hi> no doubt they may do
so for <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Advantage,</hi> for that is certainly
as good a ground, as Cowardliness and Baseness;
and then what becomes of this boasted <hi>Honour</hi>
that is so much talk'd of; this <hi>greatness of Mind,</hi>
that will keep a Man from <hi>doing</hi> an <hi>ill thing.</hi>
In reality, 'twill at last amount to no more than
this, that he will forbear doing <hi>an Ill Thing,</hi> when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59819:10"/>
he thinks it will <hi>prove ill to him:</hi> he will be Just,
Honest and Sincere when he <hi>don't dare</hi> be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
for fear of the Law, Shame, and Ignominy:
For all Men of Atheistical Principles would be
Knaves and Villains <hi>if they durst,</hi> if they could do
it safely and securely: such a Man ('tis like) shall
return you a Bag of Money, or a rich Jewel you
happen to depose in his Hands; but why is it?
'tis because he <hi>dares</hi> not keep it and deny it; 'tis
great odds but he is <hi>discovered</hi> and <hi>exposed</hi> by this
means; and besides, 'tis Unfashionable and Ungenteel
to be a Cheat in such Cases. But to impoverish a
Family by Extravagance and Debauchery, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
Creditors of their just Debts, or Servants of
their Wages, <hi>to Cheat at Play,</hi> to violate one's
Neighbour's Bed to gratifie one's own Lust, are
things, which though to the full as Wicked and
Unreasonable in themselves, are yet swallowed down
as allowable enough, because common and usual, and
which are not, the more is the pity, attended with
that Scandal and Infamy that other Vices are. Thus
'tis very plain, that this pretended Principle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in an Atheist or a Wicked Man, and this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Deference that he pretends to pay to
the Laws of his Country, is a most <hi>Partial</hi> and
<hi>Changeable</hi> thing, and vastly different from that
true Honour and Bravery that is founded on the
Eternal Basis of Conscience and Religion; 'tis an
Airy Name that serves only to amuse unthinking
and short-sighted Persons into a Belief, that he hath
some kind of Principles that he will stick to; that
so he may be thought fit to be <hi>trusted, dealt</hi> and
<hi>conversed withall</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59819:11"/>
And thus, I think, it is very clear and apparent that
Wickedness naturally leads to Infidelity and Atheism,
and Infidelity and Atheism to the Support and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of That: And that <hi>it is the Wicked that will
not seek after God, and whose thoughts are that there
is no God.</hi> Which was my First Particular.</p>
            <p>I come next to Consider,</p>
            <p>II. That Peculiar Kind of Wickedness which the
Psalmist here takes notice of, as the chief Ground
from whence Infidelity and Atheism proceed: And
that is <hi>Pride. The Wicked, through the Pride of his
Countenance will not seek after God, neither is God in
all his Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I question not but this Vice of <hi>Pride,</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the Concomitant of Infidelity, and the chief
Ground from whence the Spirit of <hi>Speculative Atheism</hi>
proceeds. When Men of proud and haughty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
lead ill Lives, as they very often do, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
endeavour to justifie themselves in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
be it never so Irregular and Absurd, and
never so contrary to the considerate Sentiments of
all the rest of the World. A Proud Man hates to
acknowledge himself in an Errour, and to own that
he hath committed a Fault: He would have the
World believe that there is a kind of <hi>Indefectibility</hi>
in his Understanding and Judgment, which secures
him from being deceived and mistaken like other
Mortals. Whatever Actions therefore such a Person
commits, he would fain have appear reasonable and
justifiable. But he sees plainly that he cannot make
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59819:11"/>
Wickedness and Immorality do so, as long as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
stands its Ground in the World. The Sacred
Scriptures are so plain and express against such a
course of Life, that there is no avoiding being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
and condemned while their Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
good: 'Tis impossible any way to reconcile
a vicious Life to the Doctrine <hi>there</hi> delivered: And
therefore he sees plainly, That one that Professes to
believe the great Truths of Religion, and the Divine
Authority of those Sacred Books, and yet by his
Practices gives the Lye to his Profession, and while
he acknowledges Jesus Christ <hi>in his Words, doth in
his Works deny him;</hi> he sees, I say, that such an one
stands <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Self-condemned, and can
never acquit himself either to his own Conscience,
or to the Reason of Mankind. Now this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
disagreeable to the Genious and Humour of
a Proud Man; he cannot bear to be thought in
any respect Incoherent or Inconsistent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
And therefore having vainly tried to justifie
himself in his Wickedness, by alledging the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of some good Men in Sacred Scripture, that
have been guilty of great Sins, but whose Repentance
he can by no means digest: And having also fruitlessly
endeavoured to rely on the <hi>perverted Sense</hi> of some
particular Texts of Scripture, which he knows
are sufficiently refuted by the <hi>Analogy</hi> of the whole;
he finds at last that 'tis the best way to deny
the Divine Authority of the Bible, and the Truth
of all Revelation, and so boldly shake off at once
all Obligation to the Rules of Piety and Virtue;
and since Religion can't be wrested so as to give
an allowance to his way of living, he will take
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59819:12"/>
it quite away, Banish that and God Almighty out of
the World, and <hi>set up Iniquity by a Law.</hi> And nothing
can be more pleasing and agreeable to the Arrogance
of such Men than this way of Proceeding: It gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
an insolent and haughty Spirit prodigiously,
to do things out of the common Road; to pretend
to be <hi>Adept</hi> in a Philosophy that is as much <hi>above</hi>
the rest of Mankind's Notions, as 'tis <hi>Contradictory</hi>
to it: to assume to himself a Power of seeing much
farther into things than other Folk, and to penetrate

as firmly to believe the Truth of what they perhaps

Contradiction; and become so stupid and blind,
as, like great Liars, to believe their own Figments
and Inventions<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Ephesians.</note>. To such any Extravagant and

the plainest Demonstration he can bring against

that though a Proud Man always think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the right, and arrogate to himself an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
from the common Frailties and Errours of
Mankind; yet there is no body so frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and mistaken, as he; for he doth so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimate
all his Faculties and Endowments, and is
so much enamoured of, and Trusts so much to his
own Quickness and Penetration, that he usually
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59819:13"/>
Imagines his Great Genius able to Master any thing
without the servile fatigue of Pains and Study: and
therefore he will never give himself Time seriously
to examine into things, he scorns and hates the
Drudgery of deeply revolving and comparing the
<hi>Idaeas</hi> of things in his Mind, but rashly proceeds
to Judgment and Determination on a very Transient
and Superficial View: And there will he stick, be
the Resolution he is come to never so absurd and
Unaccountable; for he is as much above confessing
an Errour in Judgment, as he is of Repenting of
a Fault in Practice. And indeed, as the absurd
and ridiculous Paradoxes which Atheistical Writers
maintain, shew their shallow insight into things,
and their Precipitancy in forming a Determination
about them; so the Pride and Haughtiness with
which they deliver them, abundantly demonstrates
the True Spirit of such Authors, and the Real
Ground both of their Embracing and Maintaining
their Opinions. <hi>Plato</hi> describes the Atheists of his
Age, to be a Proud, Insolent, and Haughty sort of
Men, the Ground of whose Opinion was, he saith,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It appeared to be the <hi>greatest
Wisdom,</hi> and the <hi>Wisest of all Opinions. Lactantius</hi>
tells us in his Discourse, <hi>De Ira Dei,</hi> p. 729. <hi>Oxon.</hi>
that the true Reason why <hi>Diagoras Melius</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
two of the Ancient Atheists denied a Deity
was, <hi>That they might gain the Glory of being the
Authors of some new Opinion, contradictory to the
common Notions of Mankind.</hi> And of the former of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59819:13"/>
these, <hi>Diagoras, Sextus Empiricus</hi> acquaints us, That
because a certain perjured Person, <hi>who had wrong'd
him, lived unpunished by the Gods, he was so enraged
at it, that he undertook to maintain there were no Gods
at all.</hi> Lib. Adr. Mathem. Edit. <hi>Genev.</hi> 1621.</p>
            <p>The like Pride and Arrogance <hi>Lactantius</hi> tells us
he found in the two great Writers that appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christianity, in his time, in <hi>Bithynia.</hi> The
former of these, who, 'tis probable, was the famous
<hi>Porphyry,</hi> called himself <hi>Antistes Philosophiae,</hi> the
Chief or Prince of Philosophers; and saith <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Nescio utrum Superbius an Importunius, pretended
to correct the blind Errors of Mankind, and to guide
Men into the True Way; He could not bear, that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
and Innocent Persons should be enslaved by the
Cheats of, and become a Prey to, Crafty and Designing
Men.</hi> Lib. de Justit. p. 420, 421. <hi>Oxon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the like Assurance do the Modern Writers of
this kind express themselves: And though they
have in reality very little or nothing New, but
only the Arguments of the Ancients a little varied
and embelished, (as I shall have occasion to observe
hereafter more at large,) yet they all set up for new
Lights, and mighty Discoverers of the Secrets of
Nature and Philosophy; and all of the assume the
Glory of first leading Men into the way of Truth,
and delivering them out of the dark mazes of Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Errors. This was the pretence of <hi>Vanini,</hi> who
was burnt for Atheism at <hi>Tholouse, A. D.</hi> 1619.

               <hi>which is wholly unknown to

            <p>After the same manner do <hi>Machiavel, Spinoza,
Hobbs, Blount,</hi> and all the late Atheistical Writers,
deliver themselves; Instances of which, I think, I
need not stay to give, since 'tis conspicuous through
the whole course of their Writings, and, no doubt,
taken notice of by every Reader; only of the first
of these, <hi>viz. Machiavel,</hi> I cannot but take notice,
that <hi>Vanini</hi> himself saith, that 'twas his <hi>Pride</hi> and
Covetousness that made him deny the Truth of the
Miracles recorded in Sacred Scripture. <hi>Amphitheatr.</hi>

            <p>And as the <hi>Writings,</hi> so the <hi>Discourses</hi> of these
Gentlemen do equally discover this Pride and Vanity:
for they do usually deliver themselves with such a
scornful and contemptuous Air, when they either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to establish their <hi>own,</hi> or to overthrow their
<hi>Adversaries</hi> Arguments, as sufficiently shews the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
and Truth of the Psalmist's Observation here,
that 'tis <hi>through the pride of his countenance, that the
wicked will not seek after God.</hi> The LXXII. indeed
render it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Through
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59819:14"/>
the abundance of his wrath:</hi> and therein they are
followed by the vulgar Latin. As if the Wicked
were angry against God, and enraged at his Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
over Humane Affairs: as if they fretted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and quarrelled at the Severity of his Laws and
Government, and scorned to apply themselves to
him by Prayer, and to submit to him by Obedience.
But though this may be a good sence of the words;
and though, I doubt not, a stubborn Frowardness
and Perverseness of our Wills against the Will of
God, may be a frequent cause and ground of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
yet our <hi>English</hi> Translation appears to me to
be much better warranted from the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> for
there it is properly, <hi>through the Elevation of his Nose
or Face.</hi> Which, truly, is very emphatical, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
such a proud and scornful gesture of Face, as
is the natural Indication of the Internal Haughtiness
of a Man's Mind; or as the <hi>Targum,</hi> on this place,
render it, <hi>of the arrogance of his Spirit.</hi> Such a Turn
and Air of Countenance as argues a proud contempt
of all the rest of Mankind, who trot on in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
road, believe and worship a God, and poorly
submit to be governed by his Laws and Precepts.</p>
            <p>And thus having dispatched my Two first Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
and shewed, That <hi>Wickedness</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> are
two great Causes of Infidelity and Atheism; I should
now proceed to speak to the Third thing observable
in my Text, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. The great Charge which the Psalmist brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the wicked Person here mentioned, <hi>That he will
not seek after God; neither is God in all his Thoughts.</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59819:15"/>
But this I must leave for my next Discourse, and
shall now Conclude with a word or two by way of
Application.</p>
            <p>Since the Case stands thus, That <hi>Wickedness</hi> in
general, and <hi>Pride</hi> in particular, do so naturally lead
to <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Atheism;</hi> and that 'tis hardly possible
to imagine a Man can entertain such an Opinion
without them: Let every one then, that hath any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
or Temptation that way, seriously examine
his own Mind, whether he be not prejudiced towards
it by some <hi>vitious Desires</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> whether
he doth not heartily <hi>wish</hi> that there were no God nor
Religion; whether he hath not, by his past Actions,
really loaded himself with <hi>guilt,</hi> and therefore is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
in his Mind with the apprehension, that the
Divine Punishment will overtake him, and light upon
him, for his Sins: Let him search diligently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath not recourse to Infidelity, as to an <hi>Opiate</hi>
in this case, to <hi>allay</hi> the Pains of his Conscience,
and to <hi>compose</hi> the Disorder of his guilty Mind, and
to gain, as it were, an <hi>Insensibility</hi> in Sinning. For
if the case be thus, 'tis plain, he is not free, and at
liberty, to make a just Judgment of the Truth of
Things; he is already a Party, and much more
enclined to one side of the Question than to the
other; and consequently, he will pitch on that as
Truth, which he would have to be so. But this is
certainly a very partial way of proceeding, and such
as no wise Man would use in a matter of so very great
moment, to engage one's self rashly in a Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
before a thorough and careful Examination of
the Evidence on both sides: This is to look on things
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59819:15"/>
in a false Light, through coloured Glasses, through
Diseased and Icterical Eyes; and then to believe
them to be <hi>in reality,</hi> what our depraved and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
Apprehensions make them.</p>
            <p>The Enemies to Religion say, That the Preachers
of it are not to be minded; the Arguments they
bring are all <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>strained,</hi> because 'tis their
Trade, and they get Money by it; and their Craft
obliges them to cry out, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians!</hi>
I hope therefore this being so <hi>Precarious</hi> and
<hi>Partial</hi> a way of Proceeding, to subscribe to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by Implicit Faith, and to take it up upon trust
from those, whose Interest (they say) it is to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
it in the World: I hope, I say, that Men will
not act so on the other hand, and embrace Atheism
and Infidelity on the same <hi>Precarious Grounds.</hi> I hope
all such Persons can clearly approve themselves to be
<hi>truly Virtuous and Moral</hi> in their Inclinations and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices;
and are sure that they have no strong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to such Actions as the World calls <hi>Vicious.</hi>
For if they have, and do take real Pleasure in the
Practice of Wickedness, 'tis plain that they must be
Prejudiced and Bigotted to their Lusts and Humours;
they cannot be <hi>Free-thinkers</hi> in the Case; the Cloggs
of ill <hi>Custom,</hi> and a loose Education bear them down,
and they cannot shake them off. Their present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
influences and governs their Belief, and enslaves
and Tyrannizes over their Reason.</p>
            <p>Let them consider impartially the Arguments for
Infidelity, and they will find <hi>them</hi> all <hi>forced</hi> and
<hi>strained Paradoxes,</hi> Invented by <hi>Sceptical</hi> and <hi>Canting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59819:16"/>
Philosophers,</hi> a <hi>Crafty</hi> and <hi>Designing</hi> sort of Men, who
set up Atheism <hi>because they Get by it,</hi> and whose <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
it is that there should be no God and Religion.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore Men be so stupid and blind as
to talk of Prejudices on the side of Religion, and
never, perceive that, there are any at all on that of
Infidelity. If they scorn to take up Religion on trust,
without examining into its Grounds and Reasons; for
their Own sakes let, them be as Cautious and Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
on the other hand, and not run Hood-winked
into Eternal Destruction, by subscribing to Atheism
in hast, and without that previous Consideration and
Regard, which so great and important an Affair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
For if they will but strip themselves of those
Prejudices which arise from their Vices, and avoid
being impetuously born down by their depraved
Inclination; they will soon perceive that the Grounds
and Principles of Infidelity are abundantly too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
to afford them any thing like a <hi>Demonstrative
assurance</hi> of the Falsity of Religion: <hi>Without which,</hi>
surely no Man of Sense, and that can think at all,
will ever run the hazard of Damnation.</p>
