            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This might move <hi>him,</hi> reforming the Church from the dregs of Idolatry and Superstition, to carry his <hi>Catechism</hi> always along with him, to read and peruse it almost every day, as he did; affirming seriously, that he always learned something from it, which he did not (at least so practically) know before.

You see here be under four chief <hi>Heads</hi> or <hi>Chapters</hi> an 107 short <hi>Articles</hi> (which also are <hi>Answers</hi> to the <hi>Questions</hi> in the Margin) now generally received.

<pb n="VII" facs="tcp:93261:5"/>
Religion</hi> amongst us, I mean the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homilies</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as agreeing with, and clearing or strengthening of the several Propositions; yea and very consonant to the main body of the materials in the <hi>short Catechism</hi> which is in the <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> to be learn'd by every Child, before he be <hi>confirm'd,</hi> or admitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Holy Communion.</hi> For the four chief heads there, are the <hi>Creed,</hi> or things to be <hi>believed</hi>; the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> shewing our duty to God and our Neighbours; the Doctrine of the <hi>Sacraments</hi>; the things contain'd in the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> And there they who present Children at <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> are charged to <hi>call upon them to hear Sermons, and chiefly provide that they may learn the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the English tongue, and all other things which a Christian man ought to know and believe to his Souls health.</hi> All which are (as in so short a room can be well expected) methodically presented to you in this Book. Wherein lastly you have our departed Friend's endeavours in a <hi>short and easie Explanation,</hi> to make the Principles plain to be understood. Now for the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>improvement</hi> of it, and the advantage you may have by it (supposing you will first read this Epistle of mine to you), I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you who have the charge of Families especially, and can read, or have those in your house or neighbourhood who will do it for you; unless your own prudence dictate somewhat better for any of you in your circumstances: (1) <hi>Distinctly</hi> and <hi>treatably</hi> to read over, the <hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,</hi> without taking any notice <hi>then</hi> of the <hi>Questions</hi>; and require those under your charge to attend diligently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. I suppose you may go over (if not all) one half of the <hi>A. s</hi> (which are printed in a large letter) at <hi>one</hi> solemn <hi>reading</hi>; then the <hi>next</hi> time the rest, beginning where you left. But if any of you think the Task too large for <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice,</hi> divide it into <hi>four</hi> or <hi>three Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> If according to <hi>Chapters,</hi> you may read each day (that you set apart for this purpose) <hi>one</hi>; if into <hi>three,</hi> according to <hi>Chapters,</hi> or chief heads, for distinction of matter, you may the <hi>first</hi> one day, the <hi>second</hi> another, and the <hi>two last</hi> on the third. If according to <hi>Articles</hi> for <hi>five</hi> days, on the <hi>first</hi> day read Nineteen <hi>Articles,</hi> on the <hi>second</hi> Nineteen more, ending with the Thirty-Eighth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, on the <hi>third</hi> twenty <hi>A. s</hi> more, ending with Article

Sixty-two, on the <hi>fourth</hi> Twenty-two <hi>A. s</hi> more, ending with <hi>A.</hi> Eighty-five, on the <hi>fifth</hi> Twenty-two <hi>A. s</hi> more, to the end. (2) Your next reading of these Principles or Articles over, should be with the Texts of Scripture that prove them, and the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of the Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> attesting and in a sort opening, or some way clearing each Proposition. (3) The last reading (if not dispatch'd at once with the second) should be the <hi>Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> enlarging more upon each <hi>Article,</hi> and so making it more plain and clear, even to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est understanding, who will be attentive and considerate. To which purpose, those who govern in each Family, should be <hi>always watchful</hi> to see there be an attendance to it without noise. But you should at the beginning, after the first Reading, set in with those under your charge to get the <hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Answers</hi> without book; (and if by Friends I understand the <hi>poorer</hi> sort will in good earnest learn them by heart, likely I may procure the <hi>A. s</hi> printed in one sheet by themselves to give to them; those who are more able will I suppose buy them). Then you may hear them repeat what they have learned; and proceed those days you <hi>Catechise</hi> them, especially every <hi>Lords-day</hi> (you who have not better helps) to read some portion of the <hi>Explanation,</hi> so much at least as was learn'd the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, engaging them by small <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> to hearken with all seriousness, and to <hi>do that with all their might</hi> which is evidently prov'd to be their <hi>duty.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously and constantly perform'd, will I hope through <hi>Gods blessing</hi> turn to a good account for <hi>you</hi> and <hi>me.</hi> 'Tis only for the sakes of some I am thus <hi>minute.</hi> Give me leave then particularly to mind those who have not yet exercised themselves to Prayer (as they should have done), how this <hi>Book</hi> may be helpful, and improv'd to a solemn performance of that <hi>duty,</hi> and an attainment of a <hi>gift</hi> therein; by having variety of orderly and <hi>fit matter</hi> upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from a distinct knowledg of our sins and wants. As for instance, <hi>A.</hi> 98. you have the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> described, which you will do well to read, pause upon, and consider how it is prov'd by <hi>Scripture-Testimony,</hi> and how <hi>attested</hi> by our Forefathers; then read our Authors <hi>Explanation</hi> of it, whereby you will come to understand the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi>; and in whose <hi>name</hi> it is to be offered to God, for which see
<pb n="IX" facs="tcp:93261:6"/>
also <hi>A.</hi> 21, 25. Now for you who are a Learner, to frame your self to <hi>pray</hi> orderly and pertinently, you may look into, and meditate upon <hi>A.</hi> 4. compar'd with <hi>A.</hi> 100, 101. for a <hi>Preface.</hi> Then pass on to <hi>confess</hi> your original sin, by considering (and if you will you may take your Pen and write out particulars prayer-wise) <hi>A.</hi> 14, 15, 16. compared with <hi>A.</hi> 13. Then you may particularize your actual trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, by considering what is <hi>forbidden</hi> in every <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> of the Law, and acknowledging those sins, which by looking into that glass you find your hearts to upbraid you with, <hi>A.</hi> 47, 51, 55, 61, 65, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81. Then you may see their aggravations, <hi>A.</hi> 83, 84. with their Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Then the consequents or punishments due to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors, <hi>A.</hi> 17, 18, 19. Hereupon consider the <hi>Gospel</hi> requires <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance, A.</hi> 86, 87. Then come to the next part of Prayer, <hi>viz. Petition.</hi> Here you may have directions to pray for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> working in Effectual Calling, <hi>A.</hi> 29, 30, 31. Pleading <hi>Christs</hi> mediation, <hi>A.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particularly, that God would give what he <hi>requires</hi> in his holy <hi>Commandments, A.</hi> 46, 50, 54, 57, 64, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80. compar'd with <hi>A.</hi> 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, and <hi>A.</hi> 33, 34, 35, 36. still collecting and compacting such <hi>materials</hi> out of these <hi>Articles,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> proving of them, with what follows (where it is needful) in the <hi>Explanation</hi> more briefly or largely, as every ones present condition and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances require. Now for the remaining part of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> you will better know what you are to give thanks for, by seeing what <hi>sins</hi> or <hi>evils</hi> God hath kept you from; and what <hi>good</hi> things he hath bestow'd upon you. And this you will materially discern, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering well what you have <hi>confess'd</hi> and <hi>petition'd</hi>; then it will be further helpful to meditate upon <hi>A.</hi> 9, 10, 12, 20, 21, 22, 31, 32, 85, 88, 89. For <hi>Conclusion</hi> read <hi>A.</hi> 107. with the Scriptures and Explanation. Turn to these <hi>Articles,</hi> as you see them noted here thus minutely for the sake of you (who need such direction) and yours, some of whom possibly you may engage to write what you shew them in this order, or when you read to them, for the teaching of them to be more methodical, in learning to pray, and that longer or shorter, as occasion requires, for their own and others edification. But still remember, <hi>It is the Spirit likewise that helpeth our infirmities, Rom.</hi> 8.26. So that our
<pb n="X" facs="tcp:93261:7"/>
prayers through Christ may be truly acceptable to God, and a means of our sanctification. I do not urge you in every prayer to insist on every head here, or restrain you to these, only shew you a way how to use these; neither would I tye you to this way, but advise you to exercise your spiritual senses to discern, and have regard to your own occasions, and the enlargement of your own hearts, that out of the abundrnce of them, in faith and humility you may express your minds to God in Scripture-language, from a feeling of our own wants. Thus I have took the freedom to suggest something of <hi>help in this kind,</hi> to those who may either desire or need it. But I impose nothing upon any one, which God hath left free. I hope none that know me well, will judg me to be so narrow-spirited. I have only offered a guide to the weaker, for to bring to their mind needful matter, under the three main parts of Prayer, <hi>viz. Confession, Petition, Thanksgiving.</hi> It may be some will begin with <hi>Petition</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> and then <hi>Confession,</hi> or vary and use them interchangeably, as in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they think best for that season, or are moved by the holy Spirit to omit, or but touch on one, or the other part, and slay most on the third, which may do well. The great care to be took, is that the party <hi>praying</hi> perform this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duty with <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>sincere devotion.</hi> But I humbly conceive, it were of great advantage, for one or more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>persons</hi> in a Neighbourhood, who have better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (after the reading this I now write to you) to shew unto those of meaner abilities, the import of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise for the use and improvement of this small token for their <hi>knowledg</hi> and <hi>practise.</hi> Perhaps the <hi>School-Master</hi> may think it expedient to do it for some of his <hi>Scholars</hi> in the highest Form. However I could perswade my self some <hi>unexperienc'd</hi> in praying (especially towardly young ones) will rejoice to be directed. I have latele known some who have been much changed and wrought upon by the serious reading of such a Book as this, given and heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them. It would do well in your <hi>Family-read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it, if some of the House would turn to the <hi>Bible,</hi> and find out the <hi>Texts,</hi> that you may with your own eyes see them <hi>there</hi> as cited. I doubt not but you will find them, unless possibly by the error of the <hi>Printer</hi> (which yet I know not) there may be somewhere a failure; but
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:93261:7"/>
then you having the <hi>words,</hi> a little searching of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will soon amend that (if it should be so). But I fear in being thus particular for your <hi>profit</hi> (which I aim at) I shall run my self beyond my projected <hi>bounds.</hi> It remains I should subjoin something of,</p>
            <p n="3">III<hi>dly,</hi> Some short <hi>general Rules,</hi> consonant to Scripture, and grounded mostly upon <hi>these cited</hi> in this <hi>little Book</hi> which may be of concernment to <hi>all</hi>; to help both <hi>superiors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors,</hi> and <hi>equals,</hi> in the <hi>practice of godliness.</hi> Wherefore that you may by <hi>this Mannual</hi> grow better, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg of our good God.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Keep your end in your eye, and think much on the means prescrib'd to attain it, and how you may best use them.</hi> You must make Religion your business; and that requires you to aim at the glorifying of God, and the enjoying of him, the saving of your own souls, according to the Rule God hath given you in his word. In all your employments, whether in your general or particular Calling; and all your enjoyments, whether spiritual or temporal, magnifie the Name of God, extol his excellency and perfection in thought, word, and deed. Endeavour to carry your selves so agreeable to his mind, that you may please him, and be accepted of him. 'Tis a small matter then how you are censur'd in mans judgment.</p>

                  </gap>lding a House, if you ask him the reason why he builds a House, or what he intends in so doing; his answer will be, to dwell in it: And here, his dwelling in his House, when he hath built it, is his <hi>end</hi> in building his House. So again, when you see a man going to Church, if you ask him what he goes to Church for; he'll pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tell you, to hear a Sermon: Now this being that which he does design in going to Church, <hi>sc.</hi> to hear a Sermon, it may very well be called his <hi>end</hi> in going to Church. But then 2<hi>dly,</hi> It is next to be explained, what is meant by a mans <hi>chief end</hi>: Now a mans <hi>chief end,</hi> is that which he doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally aim at in all his actions. As to keep to the last instance, though it be a mans <hi>end</hi> (in going to Church) to hear a Sermon; yet that is but a <hi>lower end,</hi> and that which he does only design in order to his <hi>chief end,</hi> which is to glorifie God, and to enjoy Communion with God, by hearing his word: This Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore (<hi>What is the chief end of man?</hi>) is <hi>(q. d.)</hi> what is mans chief errand into the world? or what did God make man for? or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93261:14"/>
what is the great business that should take up the greatest part of a mans time, thoughts, cares, affections, and endeavours, whilst he lives in the world? or what is it that a man is principally to drive at in all his words, thoughts, and actions, in all his duties both to God and man, and in all his dealings with the world? Now this is that which should be his general drift in all, <hi>sc.</hi> To glorifie God, and to enjoy God both in this world and a better. And this is the plain meaning of those Scriptures which are here made use of as proofs. But (alas) is it not sadly to be lamented, that the corrupt generality of people, have quite forgotten what errand they were sent about into the world; whilst some make worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and preferments their <hi>chief end,</hi> as the ambitious; others make worldly gain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit their <hi>chief end,</hi> and that which they mainly drive at, as the covetous; and others do make their carnal pleasures, delights, sports, and pastimes their <hi>chief end,</hi> as if God had put them into the world, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> reports of the <hi>Leviathans</hi> being put into water, to play therein: and this is the case of the younger sort generally of vain and wicked people, who either do not know, or will not consider, that the end of their Creation was to honour and enjoy their Creator, both here and hereafter. 3<hi>dly,</hi> What it is to <hi>glorifie God,</hi> may be thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; namely, it is to live according to his will revealed in his word; or, it is to think,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93261:15"/>
speak, and do according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of his word. (1.) We <hi>glorifie God</hi> in our thoughts, or in our hearts, when we dare not allow our selves to think any thing that is not stampt with Gods authority and allowance; and more particularly, when our thoughts of God, of his works, words, and all that relates to him, are such as do become his excellent Greatness. So when we fear, love, admire, trust, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him above all. (2.) We <hi>glorifie him</hi> in our words, when our speech is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, vain, and idle, but seasoned with grace. (3.) In our actions, when we make his word our rule, and his glory our great and general <hi>end</hi> in all our actions. 4<hi>thly,</hi> What it is to <hi>enjoy God</hi>; we may best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it, by what it is to enjoy a friend: Now this is, we know, to have his presence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and converse, and to take delight in his society. So to <hi>enjoy God,</hi> it is to converse with God, to be well-pleased with his gracious presence, and not only to have him to be our Friend, or Father, but to entertain this King of glory in our hearts and affections. Or as wicked men do look upon the greatest part of their enjoyment to consist in (that which they miscall) good-fellowship; so the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>enjoying of God,</hi> is to have fellowship with him: <hi>Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</hi> And to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keep up this fellowship with God for ever, it is to <hi>enjoy him for ever</hi>; which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

We have his <hi>eternal</hi> Providence, or his decreeing, purposing, designing Providence, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but that frame, method, or order of government which was in the mind of God from everlasting, before there was a world, or any creature in it to be govern'd, (and of this was spoken before).

(2.) In the <hi>actual</hi> government of all things by his wisdom, which he doth preserve by his infinite power; for God does not do by the World as the Ship-Carpenter by the Ship, build and leave it, and never look after it more; but he doth look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the preservation of it as the Owner, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93261:23"/>
the government of it as the Pilot. Other <hi>distinctions</hi> there are of Providence; as, (2.) That it is either <hi>mediate</hi> and ordinary, as where God makes use of means and second causes, and therein does observe the order which he has set in nature, as <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.22. and this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in nature is called the Law of nature: Or else <hi>immediate</hi> and extraordinary, when in the works of Providence, as well as of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he works without means, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den.

And that God might try him, how he would carry it, being now brought within the bounds of this Covenant, he was pleased to lay this particular <hi>positive Precept</hi> upon him, That he should <hi>not eat of the tree of knowledg of good and evil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon pain of death</hi>; which Precept he having broken, became liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

The <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> was made with man <hi>before</hi> the Fall, before he had sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God; the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> afterward. (2.) The <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> did not promise pardon upon <hi>repentance</hi>; the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> does, because Christ the Mediator of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant has purchased pardon for all penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who have but a hand of <hi>Faith</hi> to receive it. (3.) The <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> was <hi>without</hi> a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93261:25"/>
                  <hi>Mediator,</hi> for till man had sinned he needed none to mediate peace betwixt God and him; but the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is established in the hands of a <hi>Mediator, sc.</hi> Christ Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, that he might make a reconciliation betwixt God and Man. (4.) In the <hi>Covenant of Nature</hi> (or <hi>Works</hi>) <hi>Adam</hi> was only the Son of God by Creation; but in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> those who were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, do through Faith become the Children of God by Grace and <hi>Adoption.</hi> (5.) The <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> had for its <hi>Seals</hi> of confirmation, or for the Sacraments of it, the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> so called because it did sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally confirm the promise of life upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfect obedience; and the <hi>Tree of knowledg of good and evil,</hi> which was so called from the event, because man having sinned in eating the forbidden fruit, he presently came to know by a sad experiment, what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good he had lost in losing Gods favour, and what misery and mischief he had brought upon himself. But now the <hi>Seals</hi> or <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> were under the Old Testament <hi>Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb,</hi> and now under the New Testament, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> (6.) In the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> there was no place at all for Gods further exercising of his patience, grace and mercy; but in the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> his <hi>mercy</hi> most is signally display'd; yea and that which is a mystery as well as a miracle of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

               <p>
                  <hi>Expl.</hi> 13. Here, for explanation sake, we may observe: (1.) That our <hi>first Parents</hi> were created with <hi>freedom</hi> of will; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> if they would have continued in their obedience they might, for they had a power to obey God perfectly; and if they would sin they might, God left them (and that very justly) to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, he being not bound to hinder them (though he could) from sinning against him. (2.) That by their sinning against God they lost this <hi>freedom,</hi> and with it all that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which did belong to a state of innocence and integrity; for by their fall they were so bruised in all their powers and faculties, that they became <hi>unable</hi> to serve God; and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired with the guilt and pollution of sin, that they were altogether <hi>unfit</hi> to enjoy God.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93261:28"/>
common phrase, that we were all in his loyns, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) naturally, as descending from him; and legally, as represented by him. Not but that we were also in the loyns of <hi>Eve</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that man being first created, and of the more noble Sex, is principally taken notice of both in the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and in the <hi>Transgression.</hi> For (2<hi>dly,</hi>) we are here to observe, that all mankind (Christ the Son of God only excepted) did sin in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; By one sin entred into the world upon all, for as much as all have sinned.</hi> Some explain this by the example of <hi>Levi,</hi> who is said to pay tythes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> though <hi>Levi</hi> was not born some hundred years after <hi>Abraham</hi> did thus pay tythes: So all <hi>Adams</hi> posterity (which proceed from him in the ordinary course of nature) may be said as well to sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> though some of them might not be born some hundreds or thousands of years after him. We know that the bonds and compacts of Parents may reach the Children; else they could not be liable nor capable of enjoying their estates, to pay their debts; and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Parent doth legally taint the Son, till it please the <hi>Prince</hi> to take it off. And then further, as the righteousness of Christ the <hi>second Adam,</hi> and his obedience, is <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to all that believe; so the disobedience of the <hi>first Adam</hi> is <hi>reckoned</hi> to the score of all his posterity, because they were legally in him, and one with him when he sinned.</p>

                  <hi>Expl.</hi> 18. There are four Particulars in this <hi>A.</hi> (which do all suppose that <hi>Adam</hi> sin'd as a common Representative of all Mankind.) As, (1.) That the guilt of that single act of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which <hi>Adam</hi> was guilty of, is very justly imputed to all the degenerate and sinful race of <hi>Adam</hi>; for that Covenant which was made with him being made with us also in him, when he transgressed by eating the forbidden fruit, we his posterity are to be looked upon as <hi>Accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and consenting to the fact; and when he thus sinned, it was as much as if <hi>all</hi> his posterity had sinned in their own persons. (2) The <hi>want</hi> of <hi>original righteousness,</hi> or the want of power and ability to do the will of God which man had by Creation; for God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93261:29"/>
that is, in a capacity and with ability to do the whole will of God; which ability was not taken away from man till he had foolishly and wilfully thrown it away. (3.) The <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> of the whole nature of man, and that in every mothers child of us (the <hi>Child Iesus</hi> only excepted). For every one of us may truly say with <hi>David,</hi> one by one, <hi>Behold I was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me</hi>: It being impossible that a clean thing should come out of an unclean. Now because this corruption of nature is the fountain of all manner of sin, both in thought, word, and deed, therefore it is called <hi>original</hi> sin. And then, (4.) All those <hi>corrupt streams</hi> which do proceed from this corrupt fountain, are called <hi>actual</hi> sins; by which I understand any action of a man, whether it be an <hi>internal</hi> action of the mind and soul; or <hi>external,</hi> of the body, which is not conformable to the Law of God; as also the neglect and omission of any action (whether internal or external) which the Law requires.</p>

Concerning this <hi>A.</hi> 'tis observable in the general, That mans losses by the sall, do reach as far as the guilt of that first disobedience whereby he fell, namely, to all mankind; yet more particularly, (1<hi>st,</hi>) <hi>Adam</hi> lost (and we in him, and with him) communion with God; and the loss of this is a treble loss, (1.) Of Gods sweet and gracious presence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that in a most immediate manner, as one friend is personally present with another. (2.) Of converse with God; for whilst God and man were together in Paradise, and man continued innocent, their society was not like that of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in their Silent-Meetings, but there would have continued such familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt them, as is betwixt two loving friends, they would have walked together, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93261:30"/>
talked together; for if God did use that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 33.11. since the fall, much more would he have continued it with <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity, if they had never fal'n. (3.) From this sweet company and converse would have sprung up in the heart, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual satisfaction and delight to the soul of man; for man yet continuing like God, he could not but love him, and delight himself in this sweet intercourse. (2<hi>dly,</hi>) The <hi>sinful posterity</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> (till interested in Christ) are actually under the wrath of God, for God is angry with the wicked every day; and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under the curse, because under the Law, not under Grace.

of these <hi>two</hi> things in Gods decree of Election, (1.) Gods most <hi>wise</hi> design, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the glory of his free-grace, in bringing many sons to glory. (2.)

This word [<hi>justification</hi>] doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, not only to make just or righteous, but also to make a man appear so; (yet not by infusing or working grace or righteousness in the Soul, for this is the meaning of that word <hi>sanctification</hi>), or it signifies the believing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being <hi>reputed</hi> or <hi>accounted</hi> righteous in the sight of God, in and through the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ imputed to the sinner, or accounted as his own; for as <hi>condemnation</hi> doth suppose a man guilty, because the just God doth not condemn men for nothing; so <hi>justification</hi> doth suppose a man discharged from guilt, and so not obnoxious to the penalty or curse of the Law; now because the sinner can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect to receive this discharge by vertue of his own personal righteousness, because all his righteousness is imperfect, or as a menstrous rag; therefore he must be found not having on his own righteousness for his justification, but the righteousness of Christ.

(2.) The <hi>inward</hi> moving cause, <hi>free-grace</hi>; and not any foresight of faith or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the sinner, to move him to it. (3.) The <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>justification,</hi> or in reference to what the sinner is justified; namely, the guilt of sin and curse of the Law. (4.) The <hi>manner,</hi> which consists in a legal discharge of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from his former obligation to punishment, here called the pardon of his sins, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him as righteous.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93261:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we are to understand, not meerly a believers probable guess or conjecture, or his hope and expectation to be saved; but an infallible certainty, or that which is called in Scripture the full assurance of faith, concerning the love of God, and the believers eternal salvation; which certainty is built, (1.) Upon the <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty</hi> of Gods promise to save those who do believe or accept of Christ, as he is tendered in the Gospel. (2.) Upon the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable evidence</hi> of the truth and reality of those graces unto which the promise of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is made. (3.) Upon the <hi>necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> which there is betwixt the means and the end, betwixt true and saving-grace and salvation it self. (4.) And upon the <hi>sure testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of the Spirit of Adoption, witnessing with the spirit or conscience of this or that particular believer by name, that he is a Child of God. Concerning which assurance these <hi>three</hi> things are to be noted, (1.) That there may be a true saving-faith, where there is not the full assurance of faith. It doth belong to a believer <hi>only,</hi> but not to every believer. (2.) That it is every believers <hi>duty</hi> to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this assurance, to use his utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make his Calling and Election sure. (3.) Though this assurance may be darkened, diminished, and interrupted through sin or temptation, yet it is ever accompanied with so much <hi>secret</hi> support to the soul, as that it does keep the soul from total and final despair.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93261:47"/>
And so there is room left still for [the second benefit, <hi>sc.</hi>] <hi>peace of conscience</hi>; in which there is, (1.) Something <hi>privative, sc.</hi> a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable freedom (not perfect and universal) from that which Divines call trouble of mind, arising from the apprehension of guilt and of the wrath of God; and though in one who has this assurance, the peace of his mind may be disturbed, yet it is but disturbed, and not absolutely lost; as the peace of a State is not lost by every tumult whereby it is disturbed. (2.) There is something <hi>positive</hi> in this peace, <hi>sc.</hi> that sweet calm and satisfaction which there is in the mind upon the attaining of this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. [Third benefit, <hi>sc.</hi>] <hi>Ioy in the Holy Ghost, sc.</hi> a joy springing up in the soul from the comfort and certainty of his testimony, and for the sweetness of his presence.

This arrogancy God detested, that man should so advance his Laws to make them equal with Gods Laws, wherein the true honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and right worshipping of God standeth, to make his Laws for them to be left off. God hath appointed his Laws, whereby his pleasure is to be honoured.—They were not content to have them called by the name of other Temporal Laws; but called them <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> Traditions; and would have them not only esteem'd for a right and true worshipping of God (as Gods Laws be indeed), but also for the most high honouring of God, to which the Commandments of God should give place.

(3) That the bonds of the Covenant should be as the <hi>cords of love, and the bands of a man,</hi> sweetly to draw men to obedience; when once we are listed into the number of Gods people by <hi>Baptism,</hi> we are under a more special obligation to obey God not only as our Creator, but as our Father. (4.) That <hi>deliverances</hi> call for duties; and if a corporal deliverance of the <hi>Israelites</hi> was an obligation upon them to obey the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> much more should that spiritual deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> slavery of sin be an obligation upon them to obey God.</p>

In it self, not admitting of any additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Precepts in the Gospel, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obliging to all Christians which were not obliging before that Christ came in the flesh. For as for those three Precepts of the Gospel, for a man, (1.) To deny himself. (2.) To take up his Cross; and (3.) To fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ; they are rather interpretations and instances of that honour and love we are to have for Christ as God, which is required in the First Command, than any additions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, which did not oblige before; nay <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himself did in some respect deny himself, take up his Cross, and follow Christ; the middle of these had place when he said, <hi>The reproaches of those who reproached thee are faln upon me</hi>; and so <hi>Moses</hi> deny'd himself, and <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshuah</hi> followed the Lord fully. (2.) The Law is perfect in its extent and comprehension, in regard of the subject, for it doth command the whole Soul in all its powers and faculties; for it doth require the understanding to know, the judgment to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that which is good; the will to chuse it, the memory to retain it, and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to pursue and enjoy it; and upon this account it is said, that the Law is spiritual.</item>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93261:53"/>
forbids it commands the contrary; as when it forbids us to take the name of God in vain, it requires us to use any of the names, or titles, or ordinances of God with reverence.</item>
                  <item>4 <hi>Rule,</hi> When the Law commandeth a duty, (as suppose to worship God) it doth require us to make use of means, occasions, motives and encouragements to it: and when the Law forbids (<hi>ex. gr.</hi> worshipping of Images), it doth also forbid the occasions, appearances and inducements of any evil.</item>

                  <item>6 <hi>Rule,</hi> That the duties of the second table must give place to the indispensable and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary duties of the first table, when they cannot both be performed together, as the love of Parents must yield to the love of God; but in things ceremonial, the duties of the first table must yield to the moral duties of the second; as sacrificing to works of mercy towards man.</item>

(3) That Christ is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative of his Grace, for therefore hath he appointed <hi>means</hi> of Grace for the conveying of Grace to his members; he is not a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sealed, but a fountain open'd. (4) That it is the duty of Christians to attend diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Ordinances of Christ, for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the necessity of the end requires it, there being no other ordinary way for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the end, but by these means, but also the obligatory power of Gods Command.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93261:85"/>
of Christs Ordinances. (6) That if Christians be never the better for Christ, and by what he has done for sinners, they may thank themselves, for God has prescribed means whereby they may reap benefit from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of Christ; if then they do miss of life and salvation, 'tis because they will not come to him that they may have life.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93261:87"/>
it is a part of Sanctification, and not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work of the spirit which is reckon'd up amongst those things which do not accompany Salvation, as every part of Sanctification doth. (2<hi>dly,</hi>) Concerning the immediate <hi>spring</hi> of this repentance, and that is a true sense of sin, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) such a sense of sin as doth break the heart for sin, and that in a kindly manner with grief, or godly sorrow not with despair; this latter sense of sin may be found in a <hi>Iudas,</hi> but only the former in a <hi>Paul</hi>; for whether it be in reference to the guilt of sin, a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent does not despair of pardoning mercy; or whether it be in reference to the punishment of sin, he hopes to be deliver'd from the wrath to come; and therefore this true sense of sin, and a lively apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ are here joyned together. (3<hi>dly,</hi>) We have here the <hi>inward acts</hi> of repentance, as (1) <hi>grief</hi> of heart for sin, called therefore a being pricked at the heart, and a being contrite, and broken in spirit; which is when a mans heart is ready to bleed and melt, and tremble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him because he has broken the holy Law of God, and has thereby foolishly exposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the curse and penalty of the Law. (2) <hi>Hatred</hi> of sin whereby a man doth disrellish, and dislike sin, and can roul it as a sweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel under his tongue no longer; when he does not only not love sin, but he abhors it, the very thoughts of it are grievous and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him; and therefore (3) he <hi>turns</hi> from it,

not only does as one who turns away his <hi>face</hi> that cannot endure to behold it, but his <hi>feet,</hi> for he hastens as far from it as he can, and that he may secure himself from the danger of it he turns from it to God.

(2) For <hi>our selves,</hi> that we may receive it as the ingrafted word which is able to save our Souls; yet more particularly (1) that we may mingle it with <hi>faith,</hi> it being that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the most firm or the highest degree of assent that we are able to give to any thing. (2) That we may receive it with <hi>love</hi> (1) to <hi>God</hi> the author of it, and because 'tis his word. (2) To the <hi>Preacher</hi> as sent by God; (3) to the <hi>word</hi> it self, because for the matter 'tis that which doth so highly import our happiness. (4) We are to give <hi>reception</hi> and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only in the porch of our ear, but in the best room of our hearts; yea it being a precious treasure, better than gold and silver, it must be our care, (1) to <hi>lay it up</hi> as <hi>treasure</hi> in our hearts, to <hi>hide</hi> it there as <hi>David</hi> did.

In the general, all sound Divines do agree, that a Sacrament hath these two parts, (1) an <hi>outward sign,</hi> such as are the objects of sense, and especially of seeing; for though bread and wine be objected or presented to the taste, as well as to the eye; and water to the touch, yet the representation or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of Christs body broken and his blood shed, is in seeing the bread broken and the wine poured out; and the spiritual wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the soul represented to the eye of faith, by that washing of the filth of the flesh which is visibly done before the eye of the body. (2) <hi>Invisible grace</hi>; for the internal applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs benefits to the soul being of a spiritual nature, cannot be seen by the eye of the body; yet more particularly, in this <hi>A.</hi> we have the nature and quality of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis a holy Ordinance, (1) it has <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to the Lord stampt upon it, and so is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in its nature. (2) It is <hi>instituted</hi> by Christ the <hi>holy one</hi>; it is not his Holiness at <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather <hi>that man of sin,</hi> that can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a Sacrament, though he hath taken the boldness to add five Sacraments to those two which Christ hath appointed. The holiest man upon earth cannot appoint a Sacrament; it is priviledg enough in man to celebrate it when it is instituted by God. (3) It is a means for the promoting of sanctification and holiness,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93261:92"/>
for it is an obligation upon a Christian to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and though it be not a means to work conversion (ordinarily at least), yet it doth excite, quicken, and confirm grace. (4) It is the seal of a holy Covenant, wherein (as by a Deed of free-gift) all the benefits of Christs Redemption are made over and applyed to believers, and wherein all the promises are Yea and Amen through Christ unto such. (5) It is an Ordinance that in a most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner is accompanied with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, influence, and comforts of the Holy Ghost, because at such a time the Spirit in a most remarkable manner is concerned to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his office, as the Spirit of Adoption wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing together with the spirits of believing Receivers, that they are the children of God. And doth not all this holiness wherewith this Sacrament is attended, require on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants part a holy and solemn prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

It is a sign of regeneration or new birth, whereby (as by an instrument) they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Baptism rightly, are grafted into the Church; the promises of forgiveness of sin, of our adoption to be the Sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed.</p>

                  <hi>Expl.</hi> 94. In this <hi>A.</hi> we have (1) the <hi>general</hi> notion of <hi>Baptism</hi>; It is a Sacrament (<hi>i. e.</hi>) a seal of the righteousness of faith, and so is every other Sacrament which is a seal of the Covenant of Grace, whether under the legal or evangelical dispensation. (2) We have here the <hi>description</hi> of Baptism, and therein the <hi>difference</hi> of Baptism from the Lord's Supper. (1) In the <hi>outward</hi> signs or elements in <hi>that</hi> water in <hi>this</hi> Bread and Wine, and God having been so particular and distinct in appointing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93261:94"/>
these, we should be as strict and careful in the use of them; not <hi>adding</hi> to them the corrupt inventions of men, as the <hi>Papists</hi> do add to Water, Cream, Salt, Oyl and Spittle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor <hi>diminishing</hi> from the other, As they do when they deprive the people of the Cup. (2) They <hi>differ</hi> in their <hi>order,</hi> for Baptism is the <hi>first</hi> Sacrament of the Gospel, because it is to be administred when a Christian (or the Infant of one or both believing Parents) is solemnly to be admitted a member of Christ's visible Church, but the Lord's Supper is to follow this. (3) In <hi>frequency,</hi> Baptism is to be administred but <hi>once,</hi> because a man can be born but once spiritually (as well as naturally) and this Sacrament is a seal of this spiritual birth, when the inward Baptism of the Holy Ghost, is accompanied with the outward of Water, which by the way being both inward and outward, may be called the Doctrine of Baptisms; but the Supper being to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual nourishment to the soul, may and must be <hi>often,</hi> because we often stand in need of it. (4) In the <hi>form</hi> of administration, Baptism being in the Name of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; because we are to be baptized into all the three persons in the Godhead; but the Supper in these words, <hi>take, eat, this is my body,</hi> &amp;c. (5) In Baptism is sealed to us and represented our <hi>dying</hi> unto sin, and <hi>living</hi> unto righteousness (especially in those of years-that are baptized) but in the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93261:94"/>
other Sacrament, <hi>Christ dying</hi> for our sin is represented and confirmed to us. (6) Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism doth <hi>seal</hi> us a <hi>title</hi> to all visible Church priviledges and ordinances of the Gospel, and the Lord's Supper doth <hi>suppose</hi> this title both to these and all the benefits and advantages of the Covenant of Grace. (7) In Baptism we solemnly <hi>engage</hi> to be the <hi>Lords,</hi> and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely his; and in the Supper we renew this <hi>engagement,</hi> and not only our renewal of our vow, but our Baptismal vow should be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and seriously considered, especially in a time of Temptation and Apostacy.</p>

(2) For the <hi>thing</hi> it self, we have (1) the necessary <hi>Requisites</hi> of Prayer. (2) The ordinary sorts and <hi>kinds</hi> of it. Necessary Requisites are (1<hi>st</hi>) that it be an <hi>offering</hi> up of our desires to God, and this is essential to all Prayer, that there be a holy motion of the will towards God in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93261:99"/>
pious and devout desires though these should never be framed into words; <hi>Internal</hi> or heart-Prayer in some cases is all that God requires, and therefore he will graciously accept of it: But this spiritual Sacrifice must be presented <hi>only</hi> to God; for (1) He <hi>only</hi> knows, and can supply our wants. (2) Faith and Prayer must go together, and faith is <hi>only</hi> to be in God. (3) The Lords Prayer doth <hi>only</hi> send us to God and no other.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93261:99"/>
who ask that they may consume what they ask upon their lust, do ask amiss for the end;) so neither their <hi>fancy</hi> their <hi>rule,</hi> for then they ask amiss for the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> both. (2) And more <hi>particularly,</hi> the Lords Prayer; for this may be used not only as a Prayer it self, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. but also as a <hi>pattern</hi> for all other Prayers, not so much for <hi>method</hi> and order, for we are not so strictly tyed to that; as for <hi>matter</hi> in which we are not to deviate from this so comprehensive directory in the matter of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. (3<hi>dly,</hi>) In the <hi>name</hi> of Christ, <hi>(i. e)</hi> (1) By virtue of his <hi>warrant</hi> and authority, because he doth command us to pray. What is done by his authority, is in his Name. (2) Making use of him as our <hi>Mediator</hi> or Intercessor, or great Master of Requests in Heaven; for we are strangers to God and enemies to him naturally, and so must make use of the Name of Christ, and not of our own. (2<hi>dly.</hi>) The ordinary <hi>kinds</hi> or <hi>parts</hi> of Prayer, are (1) <hi>Confession</hi> of sin, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or implyed, for when we beg or <hi>petition</hi> for any mercy, we are to own our unworthiness of it, which we cannot well do without confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sin.

By <hi>kingdom</hi> we are to understand in the general, Gods rule and dominion and power, that he exerciseth in the world, both over all his creatures, and particularly over men. Now in reference to the wicked, God doth exercise the <hi>kingdom</hi> of his power and justice in restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or punishing them; and thus to pray that this <hi>kingdom</hi> may come amongst wicked men, is to pray, that the interest, power, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Sin, Satan, and Antichrist in the world may be destroy'd; for in this <hi>Petition</hi> we do acknowledg our selves to be by nature sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Prince of darkness, and therefore we are to pray, that this iron-yoke may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we may take upon us the easie yoke of Christ.

(3) That to this end and purpose God would bestow his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> upon his people, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth to lead them into all necessary truth, as a Spirit of Holiness to sanctifie them, and as he is the comforter. (4) That the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate may be laid out for the good of the Church; and that God would still furnish his Church with such Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, both Spiritual and Civil, as may most promote the interest of Christs spiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and all this we are to beg of God alone, (1) because he alone can check and restrain whatever does <hi>oppose</hi> his kingdom. (2) Because he alone can effectually <hi>grant</hi> what we beg herein.

In reference to the petition about <hi>forgiveness,</hi> there is (1) something <hi>imply'd.</hi> (2) The <hi>matter</hi> of the Petition, and (3) the <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration</hi> of it. 'Tis <hi>imply'd,</hi> (1) That man is naturally a <hi>guilty</hi> creature, and under the condemnation, and consequently obnoxious to the curse of the Law, both by reason of Original and Actual sin. (2) That of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he <hi>cannot</hi> make <hi>satisfaction</hi> to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, nor any other for him (Christ only excepted, who is God as well as man). For if man, or any other creature for him, could satisfie Gods justice, he might then stick to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93261:105"/>
that plea, and stand at the bar of Justice; whereas he is now forc'd to the throne of Grace. (3) That God <hi>only</hi> can forgive sin, for man is here directed only to God. (4) That confession of sin, and petition unto God for pardon, is the <hi>way</hi> to obtain this pardon in and through Christ. (2<hi>dly,</hi>) The <hi>matter</hi> of the petition, or that we pray for, 'tis directly and expresly <hi>remission</hi> (or forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) of sins, and then consequently the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christs righteousness to us, by virtue whereof we may find acceptance with God the Father, in and by and through the merit of the righteousness of his Son Christ. For as by <hi>bread</hi> in the former Petition we do by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> understand all the necessaries of this corporal life; so in this <hi>Petition,</hi> by <hi>forgiveness</hi> we may understand that which is so necessary to eternal life, Christs <hi>righteousness</hi> to be imputed to us; or in one word, in this Petition we beg justification of our persons, as in the next we beg sanctification of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hearts, and lives. In short, sith there is <hi>forgiveness with God that he may be feared,</hi> we who are so many condemned Malefactors must make our application and our supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, and to him alone for pardon; for sin is such a burden, and of such intolerable weight, that 'tis only omnipotent mercy that can remove the guilt of it from the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, it being an opposition to the holiness of Gods nature, who is infinite; as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93261:106"/>
well as a violation of that Law which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad; and therefore, by the way, sin may very well pass for the greatest of evils, sith (1) only the <hi>righteousness</hi> of Christ is broad enough to cover it, that the shame of the sinners nakedness may not appear; (2) only the <hi>mercy</hi> of an infinite God could pardon it; (3) sith 'tis a down-right defacing of the <hi>image</hi> of God in man, and instead thereof drawing the black lines or image of Satan up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mans soul; (4) and is consequently the greatest <hi>enemy</hi> to mans happiness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; (5) It doth procure for the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unpardoned sinner, the <hi>eternal</hi> wrath of God and flames of hell. <hi>Q.</hi> But it may be here demanded, <hi>why our sins are called debts</hi>? For an <hi>Answer</hi> we are to know in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they are not so properly, but meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, with allusion to those debts that are contracted between man and man; for God is not to be consider'd properly as a <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,</hi> but as a <hi>Governour</hi>; so that in strict sense our obedience (rather than our sin) is our debt to God, and such a debt as we owe to him by the Law of our Creation; so that our sins are called our debts only because sin doth make punishment to become a debt which we owe unto God, and 'tis our just debt, and of the <hi>two</hi> it is <hi>punishment</hi> which man doth suffer for sin that comes nearer to the nature and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a debt than sin it self, this being a due debt to Gods Justice, as <hi>obedience</hi> is to his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93261:106"/>
Authority, however we cannot pray that this debt of punishment be remitted, except we beg that guilt (which is an obligation to punishment) be first removed. (3ly) We have the <hi>illustration</hi> of the matter of this Petition, by an apt similitude or resemblance, <hi>sc. as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our debtors</hi>), which words with reference to God, are not to be considered either as a <hi>rule</hi> that God should proceed in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to forgive us as we do others, or as a <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> that God should measure out so many pardons to us as we give to those who do offend us, but (1) as an <hi>argument,</hi> (2) as an <hi>evidence.</hi> The <hi>argument</hi> proceeds from the Jess to the greater; that if we who have (but as it were) a drop of mercy, can forgive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, how much more will God (who is an Ocean of free-grace and love it self) forgive us; not that our forgiving others is merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of Gods forgiving us. (2) Our forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving others, when 'tis done freely and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and universally, 'tis a <hi>fruit</hi> of the love and mercy of God shed abroad in our hearts, an <hi>evidence</hi> of true grace in the soul, or of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and those whom he has sanctified he has also justified.</p>
