            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Soveraigne Lord King <hi>Charles</hi>
after his Royall entertainment by
his most loving and faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this famous City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
by those grave Senators of the Citie,
shewing their joyfulnesse by their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and dutie; and the meaner sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rejoycing in their hearts, in hopes of
a happy reformation, that would by his
meanes be put forward, after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
his Majestie home to <hi>White Hall,</hi>
where after many kinde congratulations,
the Lord Maior left him with the rest of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96010:3"/>
Citizens, and returned home to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
habitations triumphing. And so leaving
the perambulation, falling upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
and matter.</p>
            <p>His Maiestie after his safe and happie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
went to the <hi>Parliament House,</hi> And
viewing the Trained Band which tended
there for the safeguard of that Honorable
<hi>House,</hi> he fearing some casualties that might
happen by it, discharged them, thinking
they would be as safe as his Sacred Person.
But upon their discharge, some godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of honest Report, house keepers of
reputation and good credit; the streames
of their thoughts running upon some other
obiect, went thither with some discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
feares, to shew their loving affections,
with their lives and estates, as it did appear
by their designes, but there being legions of
spirits foming after the honour of the
world, rather then the glory of God.</p>
            <p>There presently coming by the Bishop
of <hi>Lincolne (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>A)</hi> by name, and spying these
Christians there, he certified the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
that there was a tumult gathered together,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96010:3"/>
of inhumane fellowes. There being at
that time betweene both Houses some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
about Bishops, he certifying at that
time that there was none but such there as
could not abide the Divine Service. Vpon
his Relation there was two of them called
in before the House and examined, upon
this Cogitation which came into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
braine. Whereupon after a while one
was asked where he was at Church by the
Honourable House, which being present
with them there the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne;</hi>
The parties answer was, That he was at
<hi>Aldermanbury</hi> at Master <hi>Calamies.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Bishop asked him, If he were
present all the while at the Divine Service;
He made Answer, that he was there from
the beginning to the ending. (which being
as short an answer, as the matter used in
that Congregation.) Then was the other
Questioned, where he was at Church; His
Answer was, That he was at <hi>Wool-Church.</hi>
Then the Bishop demanded of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was at Divine Service or no; but
his reply was agreeable to the others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96010:4"/>
being very wittily replyed, which
was, from one end to the other, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Service read at all, being well
knowne every where. This question of
the Bishop being so fully answered, one of
their Honours said, they were worthy to
be recompenced for their paines; for their
answer gave great content.</p>
            <p>Besides, their accuser the Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne</hi>
said, it was well done of them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they were freed of their opposer (his
aimes and ends) which being contrary to
his expectation, and the rest of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
said, they were worthy of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for their paines; for they had answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all Objections that was put to them, and
had cleered themselves.</p>
            <p>This being a pretty remarkable passage,
and let it exhort Christians to be milde in
their speeches; calling to minde an olde
Proverbe, <hi>Ill words corrupts good manners;</hi>
therefore, let all Christians pray for peace
and happinesse, that the King our anointed
may flourish over us in a Ioyfull and setled
peace, both in this and his other two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96010:4"/>
Kingdomes, that He and his people may
triumph; And the enemies of God, his
Church, and People, may be confounded
in their plots and intentions.</p>
            <closer>And thus courteous Reader, I bid thee
farewell.</closer>
