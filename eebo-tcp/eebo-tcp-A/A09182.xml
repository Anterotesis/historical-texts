         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

IN the tyme of Herode kynge of

Zachari of the familye and
 house of Abia: and hys wyfe of
the doughters of Aaron, and her name
Elizabeth. They were bothe ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
before God, and walked in all the
commaundementes and statutes of
the Lorde vnreproueablye. And they
had no chylde, for Elizabeth was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
and they were both well strycken
in age. And it came to passe, as he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Priestes office before God,
when hys course came (accordynge to
the costume of the Priesthode) it fell to
hys lot, to burne incense. And he went
into the temple of the Lorde, and the
whole multitude of the people was
wythout in prayer, whyle the incense
was a burnynge. And the aungel of the
Lorde appeared vnto hym, and stode
on the ryghte syde of the aultre of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense.
And when Zachari sawe hym, he
was abasshed, and there came a feare
vpon hym. But the Aungell sayd vnto
him: feare not Zachari, for thy praier is
heard. And thy wyfe Elizabeth shall
beare thee a sonne, whose name thou
shalt call Iohn, and thou shalte haue
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14696:6"/>
ioye and gladnesse, and manye shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce

dryncke shall he not dryncke. And he
shalbe fylled wyth the holy ghost, euen

sayde vnto the Aungell, wherby

and my wife wel strycken in age. The
Aungell aunswered, and sayde vnto
hym: I am Gabriel that stande before
God, and am sent to speake vnto thee,
and to shewe thee these glad tidynges.
And beholde, thou shalt be domme, and
not able to speake, vntyll the day that
thys come to passe, because thou haste
not beleued my wordes, whiche shall
be fulfylled in their season. And the
people wayted for Zachari, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled

A man can receaue nothynge, excepte

<pb facs="tcp:14696:79"/>
And the bread that I wyll geue, is my

There is at Ierusalem by

hath fiue porches, wherein laye many

whiche had lyen sicke. xxxviii. yeares.
When Iesus saw him lye, and knewe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14696:88"/>
that he had lyen so longe, he sayd vnto
him: Wylte thou be made whole? The
sicke aunswered him: Sir, I haue no

me into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poole. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I come, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

&amp; go thy way. And immediatly, the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was made whole, and toke vp his bed,
and went his way. But vpon the same
day, it was the Sabboth. Then sayde
the Iewes vnto hym that was made
whole. Todaye is the Sabboth, it is
not lawful for thee to cary thy bed. He
answered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he that made me whole,
sayde vnto me: take vp thy bedde, &amp; go

man is that, which said vnto thee, take
vp thy bedde, and go thy way? But he
that was healed wist not who he was:
for Iesus had gotten hym selfe away,
because there was much people. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
Iesus founde hym in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

Lyke as my father hathe loued me, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

then knowe that it hathe hated me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

these thinges haue I sayde vnto you,

Whan the spirite of truthe commeth,

whatsoeuer he shall heare, that shall

and agayne after a lytle whyle, and

Then sayde they. What is this

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14696:177"/>Then perceaued Iesus that they wold
aske him, and he sayde vnto them: Ye
enquire of this amonge youre selues,
that I sayde. After a lytle while, and
ye shall not se me, and againe after a
lytle while and ye shall se me. Uerely,
verely I saye vnto you, ye shall wepe &amp;
lament, but the world shall reioyce,
ye shalbe sory, but your sorowe shalbe
turned into ioye. A woman whan she
traueleth hathe sorow, for her houre is

for ioye that a man is borne in
the worlde. And nowe haue ye sorowe
also, but I wyl se you againe, and your
hearte shall reioyce, and your ioye shal
noman take from you. And in that day
shall ye aske me no question, verelye,
verelye I saye vnto you, yf ye aske the
father ought in my name, he shall geue
it you. Hetherto haue ye asked nothing
in myne name: aske and ye shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
that youre ioye may be perfect:
these thinges haue I spoken vnto you
by prouerbes, neuerthelesse the tyme
commeth, that I shall speake nomore
by prouerbes, but I shall shewe you
plainlye of my father. In that daye
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14696:177"/>
shall ye aske in my name, and I saye
not vnto you, that I wyll praye vnto
the father for you, for the father hym

me, and beleued that I am come oute
from God. I wente oute from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and came into the worlde: againe
I leue the world, and go to the father.
His disciples sayde vnto him: beholde
nowe talkest thou playnelye, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest

thou knowest all thinges, and nedest
