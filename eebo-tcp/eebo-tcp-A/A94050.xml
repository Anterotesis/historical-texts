            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat his Majeſty came into <hi>Yorke</hi> upon <hi>Friday, March</hi> the eighteenth, betweene foure and five of the Clocke in the afternoone, with the <hi>Prince</hi> his Highneſſe, and two other yong tall Noblemen in the Coach with him; whom upon enquirie, the ſaid <hi>Iohn Strickland</hi> was informed to be the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lenox:</hi> That the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Yorke</hi> with the Aldermen, and Sir <hi>Thomas Widrington,</hi> Recorder, met with his Majeſtie, ſome mile and halfe out of Towne; where His Majeſtie was received with all cheerefulneſſe and hearty Welcome of all the City, by the expreſſion of the ſaid Recorder: Who in the Name of the Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> Aldermen, and Citizens of <hi>Yorke,</hi> made a very Patheticall Oration to His Majeſtie: Aſſuring him that the Citie was at his Arrivall, tranſported with two great and contrary Paſſions, <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioy,</hi> For His Majeſties happy Arivall, and luſtre amongſt them, whoſe preſence, with the approach of the Sunne, made a double Spring in <hi>Yorke:</hi> As the Sunne in Plants, So His Majeſtie in the hearts of all his loyall Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sorrow,</hi> For that his Majeſtie had removed ſo farre from his Parliament, and Grand Counſell (as they had iuſt cauſe to feare) in ſome diſcontent. He farther with great boldneſſe and vehemencie of Speech, deſired his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to hearken unto, and condeſcend unto his <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> now Aſſembled in Parliament: Adventuring plainely to tell His Majeſtie, that he thought in his Conſcience, That they would reſolve upon nothing, but what ſhould be to the good of His Majeſtie, and the Common-wealth, and dropped ſome teares in the delivery of thoſe words.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie was obſerved by the beholders, to ſhew no pleaſing Countenance at thoſe words, nor gave no anſwer at all.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> by Order, bare the Sword before his Majeſtie, through the Citie, unto his Pallace; But a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall company were with His Majeſtie, as the ſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth: he telling but ſome nine and thirty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſeventeene of his Guard in Coates.</p>
            <p>About eight or nine of the Clocke that very night, came in my Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> with two Coaches more: Which Lord, the morrow after, being Saturday, went out of this City againe, between five and ſixe of the Clock in the morning: It was in <hi>Yorke</hi> reported toward <hi>Hull;</hi> but whether it be ſo for certaine, <hi>Iohn Strickland</hi> cannot, nor dares not affirme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> before His Majeſtie came in, and that it was knowne for certaine, that Hee was comming, Sir <hi>Iohn Haughtham,</hi> Governour of <hi>Hull,</hi> ſent a ſervant of his, one Maſter <hi>Edward Adkins,</hi> unto the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> with this Meſſage: <hi>Viz:</hi> That he was given to underſtand, that His Majeſty was either there, or would be there very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Yorke:</hi> but if His Majeſtie had any intent to paſſe further, and come to <hi>Hull,</hi> which hee hoped that His Majeſty would not (the world in theſe diſtracted times being very apt unto Iealouſies and ſuſpitions) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Lord Major to inform His Majeſtie, how that he had a very ſpeciall Charge ſent to him from both Houſes, on <hi>Monday, March</hi> the fourteenth, not to ſuffer His Majeſtie to enter, but with a ſmall Company, ſome thirtie at moſt; And that the very ſame Command was directed unto the high Sheriffe of the County.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Iohn Strickland</hi> further affirmeth, that at his comming out of <hi>Yorke;</hi> Vpon the way he met great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Gentlemen, very well habited, all on Horſebacke, and moſt of them young Gallants, repairing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Yorke:</hi> And that there was very great talke, and ſome feares about my Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and that one of his Footmen, had like to have beene impriſoned, for ſpeaking ſtrange words in the behalfe of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he himſelf being an <hi>Iriſhman.</hi>
