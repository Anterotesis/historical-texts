         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </note> he comes to <hi>perswade</hi> them to that which is most <hi>pleasing,</hi> namely, To <hi>Vnity</hi>; to which purpose he uses four several Arguments;</p>
                  <p>First, There is a <hi>common engagement of all Saints to Vnity:</hi> I beseech you <hi>walk worthy of your Vocation, whereunto you are called, with all lowliness and meekness, forbearing one another in love; there is one body, one spirit, even as you are all called in one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103961:3"/>
hope of your calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all</hi>; here is a whole bundle of Arguments, in this first consider your Vocation, those Priviledges to which you are advanced thereby; and they leave a very great obligation upon you, as Saints to <hi>study Vnity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, There is an Argument from the <hi>Equity of the thing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> in the 7. Verse. <hi>Vnto every one of us is given grace, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure of the gift of Christ:</hi> unto every one of us; <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> one hath <hi>some gift,</hi> as it pleases <hi>Iesus Christ to proportion out such a measure to this Saint,</hi> and such a measure to that Saint; the <hi>little finger</hi> in the mystical body, so much as is fit for him, in the hand, so much as is fit for him, and this with a common respect, that there might be a mutual use <hi>of all those,</hi> with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency to the whole; in reference to the mystical body of Christ, there is an equity in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, There is a very <hi>great congruity</hi>; and that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you shall finde in the 8, 9, and 11, Verses:<note place="margin">Vers. 11, 12.</note> Jesus Christ <hi>when he did ascend,</hi> he gave <hi>gifts to men</hi>; all the gifts that are in the Churches, and graces, they are derived from the same efficient cause, and therefore it is most <hi>incongruous,</hi> that they should be distracted and divided, so as to reflect <hi>dishonorably</hi> upon him that is the sole efficient cause of them, and that with <hi>common intents and purposes,</hi> for good of the <hi>mystical body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But then fourthly and lastly, You have here another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>necessity of it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 13, 14.</note> till <hi>we all come to the Vnity of Faith,</hi> and that we <hi>be no more tossed to and fro as children, and carried up and down with every wind of Doctrine; but that we speak the truth in love, and so grow up into Jesus Christ in all things, who is the head</hi>; here is the necessity of it, you'l never grow up to intimate communion and fellowship with Jesus Christ, you'l never make a wise improvement of him, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the mystical body, unless you learn this heavenly skill, namely, How <hi>to advance Vnity</hi>; and so I come to shew you what propositions this last Argument, drawn from the necessity of the thing,<note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> will afford us; in the 15. Verse, which by Gods assistance, according as the weak measure of strength I have will bear, I shall insist upon at this time, <hi>But speaking or following the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103961:3"/>
Truth in Love, grow up into Christ in all things, which is the head:</hi> where first, its clear,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note>
                     <hi>Jesus Christ is the head of Saints, the head of the Church.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note>2. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ when he ascended and gave gifts to men, did intend, did expect, that there should be such an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the gospel, that we should grow up into Christ in all things, who is the head.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note>3. <hi>Thinking, speaking, following the truth in love, is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel method to our Spiritual welfare</hi>; I'le begin with the first,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ is the head of particular Saints, &amp; the head of the Church:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> In the state of <hi>innocency, Adam was</hi> the head <hi>of the great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of the world, when he forfeited his <hi>headship,</hi> and all that he did enjoy, by eating the forbidden fruit, that <hi>family</hi> was dissolved, he was turn'd out of Paradice, all was scattered abroad, and we with him, were then cast into <hi>a desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> unless <hi>God</hi> would be pleased to finde out a second <hi>Head</hi>; and to that purpose, out of the riches of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and the infiniteness of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that which <hi>Angels</hi> could not reach, which <hi>men</hi> had not so much as any thoughts of, or desires after, <hi>God pitched upon,</hi> namely, Christ, and <hi>designed him the Head of the Corporation of his Church,</hi> of a certain number given unto him in his eternal Counsel, for whom he should undertake; and this learned Expositors conceive to be the meaning of that place, where he speaks of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>First, That <hi>there should be a growth</hi>; how a growth? so as to compleat the number of all the Saints,<note place="margin">1. That there should be a growth.</note> that not one of them be lost: Jesus Christ hath undertaken, that he will not lose one that God the Father hath given him, and therefore all those must be called in; and it is conceived by learned Expositors, that that is the meaning of this place, <hi>Christ hath given gifts, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints</hi>; that is, for the compleating the number;</p>
                  <p>To fill up <hi>the number</hi> of persons, that so many as were
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103961:7"/>
elected from eternity, so many might be called in: and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the compleating of the <hi>graces of those Saints,</hi> both in the degrees, and in <hi>the activity of them,</hi> for Jesus Christ (it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> an admirable condescending expression) reckoneth not himself compleat, till all his members be compleat; I beseech you take notice of that first Chap. and the last verse of the <hi>Ephesians, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1. last.</note> Jesus Christ fills <hi>all in all,</hi> and yet (he saith) his body <hi>is the fulness of him</hi>; he is pleased not to account himself compleat as head of the Church, till his members be compleated, as to the <hi>number of them,</hi> and till their <hi>graces</hi> likewise be <hi>compleat</hi> to such a <hi>degree</hi> as he intended: but then</p>

Christ; here is the entertainment and improvement of the Gospel that Christ expects: but then</p>

                     <note place="margin">3 Growing up to Christ in all things.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Growing up in all things unto Christ</hi>; There is the proportion, or the dimension, as a Head, <hi>Our growth must be as large as his Headship</hi>; now as he is a <hi>Prophet,</hi> so we must grow up into him, that we may have <hi>wisdom,</hi> and all those supplies from him; as he is a <hi>Priest</hi> grow up in him, that we may have <hi>Righteousness</hi> from him, for the covering of all our sins; as he is a <hi>King</hi> grow up in him, that we may have a <hi>Redemption</hi> from all our snares, bondages and enthralments; for our being and well being, having our subsistence in him, <hi>in God the Father, and in Christ Jesus,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.1. when we are converted, we come to have <hi>a new subsistence in Christ:</hi> for <hi>Truth,</hi> and for <hi>Degrees of Grace</hi> grow up into him, for <hi>habits</hi> and <hi>acts,</hi> for the <hi>velle,</hi> as well as for the <hi>posse,</hi> for <hi>converting</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> grace, for it is he that works in you the will and the deed, <hi>of his own good pleasure,</hi> as in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. for comforts, and for hopes, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. That you may <hi>have joy through believing,</hi> and the God of peace fill <hi>you with hope,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. all our strength and comfort lies in <hi>union with Christ,</hi> and influence from him:<note place="margin">

                     </note> It is an easie matter to sprout in hypocrisie, and in self-love, and in earthliness, and so in a formal external profession, and to have a bulk of outward performances; but its an hard matter to grow into an inward communion and intimacy with Jesus Christ, to be transformed into him. So I have done now with the first thing, the sum of the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the next is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The grounds</note>The ground, why Jesus Christ expects this; for very good reasons,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Reason 1.</note>1. This is the grand <hi>purpose and effect of Christs ascension</hi>; he did ascend to give gifts, he did ascend to <hi>give his Spirit,</hi> and that is the great promise of the <hi>New Testament</hi>; he promised to give his Spirit, and shall he give his Spirit which he purchased at so dear a rate, and shall the Spirit give gifts to men, and those gifts be actuated, and exercised, and prepared for you, and shall not we improve them? O what an ill requital is here!</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">Reason 2.</note>2. He hath a <hi>vehement desire of union and communion</hi> with all those that God the Father hath given to him, <hi>Behold I stand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103961:8"/>
and knock at the door, if any will hear my voyce, then I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me</hi>; that is a melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, a winning place, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. Jesus Christ is impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient (as it were, I may speak it with reverence) to want <hi>communion with them</hi> who are his in Gods eternal counsels. But then thirdly, Christ may well expect this,</p>
                  <p>Because attaining the <hi>intended stature and measure of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> 
                     <hi>we are fit for heaven,</hi> as in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Till we all come to the unity of faith, and to the perfect stature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the age in Christ,</hi> therefore there is such a pitch, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ expects it; you will never be fit for him, till you come to your pitch: there is a <hi>minimum quod sic,</hi> as Philosophers speak about natural bodies, so about every member of the mystical body, you must come to such a degree of grace before you are fit for heaven; now God hath designed you that, that you may be meet to be partakers of the inheritance with the Saints in light: it is not slipping out of a drunkards habit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be dissolved, or to receive the communion, or to give such and such legacies, or to send for a Minister, and say, <hi>Lord have mercy on me:</hi> No; thou hast been a drunkard and an Atheist all thy days, thou art not meet to go to heaven; <hi>Paul</hi> blesseth God that hath made him meet: Heaven is a holy place, and God is a holy God, and thou hast a very cursed sinful nature, very unfit for heaven, till thou be pollished, fashioned and framed; now Jesus Christ expects this: The third particular follows; I shall not dispatch all, you'll give me leave to consult for my own health.

(my Brethren) it is most clear, your <hi>Friends grieve</hi> for it, your <hi>Enemies</hi> begin to <hi>triumph</hi> in it, that they can have such a Power in the City, and with several well-affected people in the Land, who are friends to Truth, to Peace, and to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ: They will come and tell you, What, no Government; Can ye believe they are friends to Government?

They that cannot endure a <hi>personal Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, would they have an Ecclesiastical Reformation?</hi> Will you trust them with a Government? and a Government of their own setling? what Government think you we should have? Now so many of the well-affected both of Ministers, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Noblemen in <hi>Scotland</hi> are against an Engagement in War, and so are they in <hi>England,</hi> who are they that are forward to engage? I'le put no Character upon them, you know who in <hi>England</hi> are, and you have heard who in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and what Government think you they would settle? God keep us from a Government of such mens settling; for we should have Prophaneness, and loosness, they would make such a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in Government, that all should return to the old track again; We must have as grosly mix'd Communions as ever, and their old Ceremonies, their <hi>zeal</hi> for <hi>Christmas-day,</hi> and their <hi>Good-Friday</hi> (more zeal this year then last, for these things, and more last then before) And what do these men aym at, I beseech you? The Lord God of Heaven inform us aright, if I be mistaken, I wish I might see my Error; If any of you may through discontent, be transported, the Lord discover it to you; And let us take heed of this, that while we are jarring one with another, we do not betray our selves and all <hi>to a third Party, to a Common Party, that would destroy both:</hi> It may be here may be the advantage, which is but a poor one, first <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Independents, and then destroy Presbyterians,</hi> and set up Prophaneness and Loosness as much as ever.

The third Use: And truly, I have one word more to say, and if I thought I should dye the next Fit, I should desire to speak to this City, and that is this:</p>

                  <p>First, I do not think all <hi>Opinions are Errors,</hi>

                        <p>Some Errors are

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Clubbing, and Imprisoning, and Compelling,</hi> is not the proper way to cure Errors, though there may be some course taken to <hi>restrain erroneous persons, when they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the peace and welfare of the State,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>And as for Love, they cry for Love, for Love, and it is a wonder, men that are against the very <hi>Substantials of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> yet they will cry out against any little <hi>Heterodox Opinion,</hi> and for Love: <hi>How can they ever expect that godly and wicked men should joyn together in Love?

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103961:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as is a <hi>love to the Head,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Members</hi>; such love as is not <hi>complemental, and frothy, and flattering.</hi> O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it be your care still, not to suffer your selves to be any ways misled, because there are some defects, and want of <hi>Truth and Love,</hi> it hath always been so: In <hi>Origens</hi> time and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostoms,</hi> they came to them, complaining, that there are <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions amongst Saints</hi>; they answered, And Divisions will be: <hi>Are all Philosophers of a minde?

                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Truth,</hi> let the <hi>Word of God be Rule and Judge</hi>; when you enquire after Truth, study the revealed will of God, and make use of revelations in concurrence with the Word of God; but do not set up revelations against the Word of God. It was a desperate expression from <hi>Valde,</hi> in a Book of his in great request now adays; it is true, he had many things good in him, considering the darkness of the times wherein he lived, a <hi>Spaniard</hi>; saith he, <hi>We must use the Scriptures, as we use Pictures</hi> (he was a Papist) <hi>use Pictures for a while, till we get apprehension of the thing or person realized to us, then throw them away, because now we can pray without Pictures:</hi> So, use the Scriptures till we have got our mindes raised and elevated, and then we <hi>need no Scriptures.</hi> The Lord deliver us from this Opinion, which tends to <hi>undermine the very Word of Christ.</hi>

The various sweetnes &amp; sweet vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace in Christ Iesus.</note>The third particular follows; to wit, <hi>The various sweetness, and sweet variety of that strengthning grace that is in Christ:</hi> This may be made appear, to the great comfort, and strong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Saints; and that in a <hi>fivefold Stream,</hi> flowing from this living Spring of grace in Christ.</p>
                     <p>First, Here is strength from <hi>the electing grace of God in Christ,</hi> where there is a great deal of strength, and indeed the <hi>fundamental Stone,</hi> which is the <hi>strength and support of the house:</hi> The foundation of all the Spiritual and Eternal build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lies there, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.45. <hi>He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will:</hi> Grace and his good pleasure is the Spring of all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Here is strength from <hi>the transacting grace of Christ</hi>; when there was an agreement <hi>betwixt God the Father and God the Son,</hi> God had given so many to him, <hi>he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for those many,</hi> God did accept his <hi>undertaking,</hi> then Christ went on, there was a great deal of strength in this <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi>; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>According to his purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began:</hi> how pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly given us before the world began? why? it was given us in Christ Jesus in his negotiating with God for us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Here is a great deal of strength also in <hi>the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of Christ</hi>; He hath saved us, and <hi>called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,</hi> What purpose and grace? <hi>That which was in Christ Jesus,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. He did graciously purpose it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it should be infallibly effected.<note place="margin">Note.</note> A place that in the Synod of <hi>Palestina</hi> 1200 years ago, and above, the learned Divines made excellent use of, to <hi>cut asunder the sinews of Pelagianism,</hi> as indeed it doth, and so still of <hi>Arminianism,</hi> which is but that weed revived, as learned Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> makes it most clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his <hi>Pelagius Redivivus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is a great deal of strength likewise in <hi>the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103961:28"/>
assisting grace of Christ,</hi> when there shall be new supplies communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from his Spirit, to enable us to perform every duty, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our sharpest sufferings to the best good of our souls; as <hi>Paul</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures himself, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly and lastly, There is a rich <hi>proportion of strength in Christ, for our crowning and persevering in him</hi>; even so much that the very <hi>'Devil</hi> himself shall not be able to <hi>rend us off,</hi> we standing by a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> being kept by the <hi>power of God</hi> (not onely through our Faith) <hi>to salvation:</hi> The father will hold the <hi>childe,</hi> though the poor childe <hi>through weakness</hi> let go his hold.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A serious and seasonable invitation,<note place="margin">A serious invitation for al stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to seek acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with, and interest in Iesus Christ.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is most wholesom counsel, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint now thy self with him, and be at peace, thereby good shall come unto thee.</hi> This will be the <hi>worlds condemnation with a witness, yea with a vengeance,</hi> That <hi>light came into the world, and men loved darkness better then light, because their deeds were evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O most unhappy mistake, when <hi>Sin the worst of evils</hi> hinders them from <hi>Jesus Christ the best of good:</hi> This, this if there were no more, will fully <hi>justifie him in their eternal condemnation,</hi> being that he so seriously <hi>sought unto them,</hi> to wit, in the way of <hi>his outward Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Mat. 23.37. <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not</hi>! by those Prophets which thou didst kill.</p>
