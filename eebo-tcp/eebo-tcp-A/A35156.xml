            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny Endeavours have been us'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to take off that Heavy Burthen that hath lain upon Trade during the whole Courſe of this War, and to ſecure it from the Violence of the Enemy, though moſt have hitherto prov'd ineffectual: But I have (I humbly conceive) found out an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that will remove thoſe Miſchiefs, and the Trade of the Nation thereby be protected and preſerved, and likewiſe your Majeſties Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Navy may in little time be fully Mann'd, without giving any obſtruction to Trade.</p>
            <p>Which with all Humility I do lay at your Royal Feet, in hopes that you will graciouſly Accept, and Countenance theſe my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings: Not doubting, but to ſee <hi>England</hi>

            <head>To the Right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>VVHoever with an Impartial Eye, ſhall behold the Conſtitution of the Engliſh Monarchy, muſt acknowledge it the beſt Eſtabliſh'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World; and whoſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, (and have been) the Glory of their Prince, the Bulwark of the People, and the Terrour of their Enemies; and whenever there was that happy Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King and Parliament which we have now the Bleſſing to Enjoy, it hath begot an Excellent Harmony; and Great and Glorious Actions have been perform'd by our Anceſtors, to their Immortal Fame;
<pb facs="tcp:65022:4"/>
who have often made the <hi>Gallick</hi> Shore to Tremble: And I apprehend there hath nothing been wanting in the Subject, that the ſame things have not been again effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the Defect hath been in thoſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that have been taken.</p>
            <p>Therefore I do humbly preſent theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Propoſitions (in the ſame Form they were deliver'd to the Lords of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty) in which may be ſeen (as in a Glaſs) the Source from whence our Evils have ſprung: And with all due ſubmiſſion do humbly conceive, that the whole matter carries ſo much of Reaſon along with it, that I think its unanſwerable. Not that I have any Opinion I have manag'd the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſo well; but there are ſome Truths that may be eaſily evidenced, and which require not thoſe exquiſite Parts which are neceſſary in more abſtruſe Matters, and may be perform'd by a Man of but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65022:4"/>
Trade is altogether of as great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Importance to this Nation, as the Nerves and Sinews are to the Body of Man; which being Cut, is debilitated and weaken'd: So if our Trade be ruin'd we ſhall be Impoveriſh'd, and become a Prey to our Enemies. But I fear my Zeal will tranſport me beyond my Bounds; for I plainly ſee, that the Happineſs of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the very Exiſtence and Well-being of the Proteſtant Religion, and Welfare of theſe Kingdoms, depend upon the Succeſs of this War.</p>
            <p>And God hath given us Strength and Ability, whereby we may be able to Cope with our Enemies, and Reduce them to <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hitherto we have not taken ſuch proper Meaſures in our Naval Preparations as we ought, which (I humbly conceive) hath been the Genuine Cauſe and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all our <hi>Misfortunes</hi> and <hi>Loſſes at
<pb facs="tcp:65022:5"/>
Sea</hi> during this War; and which hath greatly impair'd their Majeſties Revenue, and the Trade of the Nation.</p>
            <p>There can no Revolution happen in any Kingdom, be it never ſo Juſt, but there will be ſome Malecontents; and the nearer Ruin their Cauſe is, ſo much the more will they ſtruggle in it, (being like the Convulſions of a <hi>dying Man)</hi> and uſe all Arts, and turn themſelves into all ſhapes, ſo they may but poſſibly diſorder the publick Proceedings of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now are the Eyes of this Nation, and all <hi>Europe,</hi> upon this Auguſt Aſſembly, waiting the Iſſue of the Debates thereof, which being Vigorous and Early (Mony being the Sinews of War) will beget the like Vigour and Reſolution in the Allies, and prevent the <hi>French</hi> King from making any ſeparate Peace, which (by his Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) he hath with ſo much Induſtry endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, as knowing he muſt ſink under the wait of the <hi>Confederate Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65022:5"/>
But it aſtoniſhes me, when I conſider that two Nations, who are ſo Potent at Sea as we and the <hi>Dutch</hi> are, ſhould not make a more advantagious uſe of that ſtrength which God hath given us: The being ſtrongeſt at Sea, was ever an unſpeakable advantage; which is apparent to the whole World that we are, notwithſtanding thoſe Loſſes we have had.</p>
            <p>And we may plainly ſee that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God generally works and brings things to paſs by Natural Cauſes and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as may evidently be ſeen by the late Revolution in this Kingdom; for it was by the Evil Adminiſtration of Government, under various Circumſtances of Affairs, that contributed to it, and which gave juſt ground and occaſion for it; and was that which turn'd the Hearts of the People, and thereby begat a Union of Parties, and was the great outward Cauſe of our preſent Settlement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65022:6"/>
Therefore in vain will it be for us to cry unto God for Help, and to give a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to our Endeavours, when we take not apt and proper Meaſures.</p>
            <p>And it ſeems highly unreaſonable his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould be ſo much expos'd to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the Enemy, to the great hazard of his Royal Perſon; upon whoſe Safety depends not only the happineſs of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but all <hi>Europe;</hi> and he hath hitherto been obliged to attend the Motions of the Enemy, and to take his Meaſures according as they move; which brought his Perſon into Imminent danger.</p>
            <p>Therefore with all due Submiſſion I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, that notwithſtanding all the utmoſt Efforts that can be made, its moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible of making any Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> they being ſo ſtrong on that ſide, but by making a Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent upon their Maritime Coaſt, if not to Conquer, yet to commit the ſame Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb facs="tcp:65022:6"/>
they have done upon our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations; that they may Drink, and have their ſhare of the Cup of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and feel the diſmal Effects of War: Nothing can poſſibly wound the Enemy like it, if it be carried on by a Conjunction of ſome of the Forces of the Confederates, and back'd by a ſtrong Fleet.</p>
            <p>Then would it ſoon alter the Scene, and diſtract the Councils, and break the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Enemy; as not knowing where the Storm will fall; which will conſequently oblige them to make a Defenſive War in all Parts; and would <hi>England</hi> but Exert its Strength, I doubt not but it would ſoon pull down the Pride and Haughty Look of that Aſpiring Monarch, whoſe Inſatiable Ambition is ſuch, that he hath made <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> a <hi>Golgotha, a Field of Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there's nothing like puſhing on the War with Vigour; a Lingering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption being worſe than Death.
<pb facs="tcp:65022:7"/>
leaſt, render'd all Attempts of this Nature more difficult.</p>
            <p>And it was ever the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (as do witneſs their Wars both Foreign and Domeſtick) to puſh on a War, and come to Action, leaving the Event to <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas the Number of Looſe and Vagrant <hi>Perſons</hi> are exceedingly increas'd in the Kingdom through the Laws not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly put in Execution, and the <hi>King</hi> having ever had a Power of taking theſe up by Warrants from the Juſtices of the Peace to be ſent on Board the Royal Navy.</p>
            <p>Therefore I humbly conceive, it would much Contribute to the Publick Service, that his Majeſty may have the ſame Liberty (by Act of Parliament) of taking them up by the ſame Methods, and Employ them as he ſhall think fit, either in mixing them with the Regular Troops, or otherwiſe;
<pb facs="tcp:65022:7"/>
which would be the Raiſing of ſeveral Thouſands of ſtout and able Men, fit for Service, who are now but Drones, and as it were the Vermin of the Land; but by theſe means may be made Serviceable to the Publick; and a great Kindneſs it will be to all Parts of the Kingdom. I am</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Here preſent to your View ſome Propoſitions, which I hope may be of uſe to the Publick and Poſterity, for which they were intended: But as I have handled the matter but weakly (though to the beſt of my Skill) ſo it is evident through the whole Book, that it may be much improv'd.</p>
            <p>But having obſerv'd with much Regret, under what unhappy Circumſtances things lay in reference to Sea-Affairs, and matters growing daily worſe and worſe, by our Merchants being ſo long detained in Port, to the great damage of their Majeſties, and the whole Kingdom; I conceived there muſt be ſome Natural Obſtruction that occaſioned it, or that there muſt be ſome great defect in thoſe Meaſures that were taken; and by long ruminating upon the matter, my thoughts ſuggeſted to me, that I had diſcover'd from whence thoſe Evils did proceed, which after having drawn into ſome Form, I then preſumed to Addreſs my ſelf to the Government; and now have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to expoſe my ſelf to the Cenſure of the World: And its not any vain deſire of Applauſe that hath induc'd me
<pb facs="tcp:65022:8"/>
thus to appear in Print, but a due Senſe of that Duty which I owe to their Majeſties and my Native Country; for I was under much and great Reluctancy, before I could bring my ſelf to a Reſolution of doing it; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt Cauſe: For I was not bred a Schollar, nor ever was concerned either in Shipping or Cuſtom-houſe Affairs. So that if theſe things prove ſucceſsful (as I have no great reaſon to doubt) then muſt I wholly attribute it to the Hand of Providence.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Opinion of a great many, and thoſe Good Men too, that we have been betrayed, and a general Out-cry there is of it through the Town and Kingdom, and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with much Heat; and I believe it as much as they: But 'tis the ſins of the Nation which have betrayed us, (this is no impoſing at all, or any deſire I have of being Advocate for any) But ſetting them aſide, and calmly waying and conſidering things, it will be found, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Original of all our Misfortunes ariſe from thoſe Methods that are taken for the ſupplying the Royal Navy with Saylers; and this being but the Effects of Natural Cauſes, I hope no Man will be Offended, if I do in a great meaſure make it ſo appear, if he will ſeriouſly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially peruſe the enſuing Diſcourſe before he gives Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for ſo long as theſe Methods continue in uſe, we can humanely expect no better ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>War was always an Enemy to Trade, and Loſſes will come whenever its on foot, notwithſtanding all the Induſtry
<pb facs="tcp:65022:9"/>
that can be us'd; but its ſeldom a Nation doth obſtruct and annoy its own Trade; but that hath been our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. For, for near half the year all Ports have in them thoſe that are Enemies both to King and Kingdom, though not in Perſon or Affection, yet being arm'd with Power do obſtruct Trade, and prevent the Merchants from making their ſeveral Voyages, who would carry off the Product of the Country: By which means the King loſes vaſt Sums of Mony, and the Trade of the Nation's greatly impair'd. Its the Preſs Ketches which are guilty of all this; and its by reaſon of their ſlowneſs and difficulty they meet with in getting Men for their Majeſties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which is the grand Cauſe why our Merchants have been ſo long detain'd in Port; and they and the Coaſters have been ſo much expos'd to the Violence of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Therefore thoſe Methods we have hitherto taken, (being the ſame that were in uſe an Hundred Years ago) will not do in this Age.</p>
            <p>So its from our being wanting to our ſelves in our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Affairs, and not making due Proviſion for the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which hath been the Fountain from whence our Evils have ſprung, and not from any great Force of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, the Sailers are as Zealous for the Publick Service as any Men in the Kingdom; but Intereſt and Self-preſervation is that which governs the Actions of Men; and there is now a great Incongruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sailers Intereſt (as ſhall be made appear) and
<pb facs="tcp:65022:9"/>
that of the Publick; and ſo long as that remains, it muſt always be expected they will decline the Publick Service. But if the Government will be pleas'd to put the firſt of theſe Propoſitions in execution, and paſs the ſecond into an Act, then will they be Conſentaneous.</p>
            <p>For by them the Sailers Wages will be reduced, and as there will be little odds between the King's Pay, and that of Merchant-men; ſo they will have no cauſe to ſhun the Service, neither indeed can they; and their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it will be great, for they will have the benefit of enjoying two Charities, whereas thoſe on Board Ships of Trade can enjoy but one.</p>
            <p>I cannot without Amazement, call to mind his moſt Gracious Majeſties great Courage, Bravery and Conduct in the late Battle at <hi>Landen,</hi> which was to the Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Enemies: But at the ſame time tremble, to think to what Dangers he expos'd his Royal Perſon for our Safeties; for ſhould he have fallen, our Candleſtick would have been removed, and our Church and Nation have become a Prey to our Enemies; but God of his wonderful Providence hath protected him, and reſerved him for greater Actions, and no doubt will make him the Bleſſed Inſtrument of reſtoring Peace to <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd things lie heavy (but no ways to be compar'd to that Deplorable Condition unto which <hi>France</hi> is reduc'd) yet we have the leaſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> that is engag'd in this
<pb facs="tcp:65022:10"/>
War; for we have ſat down in the midſt of Peace, while our Neighbouring Nations (and Country-men) have been ſhedding their Blood abroad; and they have had their Countries expos'd to the Ravage of the Enemy, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Armies, and have willingly undergone all this, that they may obtain a durable and laſting Peace.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us not repine, but chearfully aſſiſt his Majeſty in proſecuting ſo Juſt and Honourable a War; and doubt not but the ſame Hand of Providence which ſo wonderfully deliver'd us, will ſtill protect us, and Bleſs our Arms, that we may bring it to a happy Period, and every Man ſit down in Peace under his own Vine.</p>
            <p>At the firſt blooming of the Goſpel, in the very Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, we may ſee that there were Diſputes in the Church, and Men had different Conceptions of things; but yet we find, they were ſtill guided by a Spirit of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charity to each other, according to the dictates of that holy Religion they profeſt; but this Age in which we live is much deviated, and fallen from that Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was ſo Conſpicuous in the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> and which the Word of God ſo poſitively Commands and Directs: But the Exceſs and Vitiouſneſs of Mens Lives are now ſuch, that more are deſtroy'd by it, than devour'd by the Sword.</p>
            <p>And ſo long as we continue theſe uncharitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Feuds, and practice theſe Immoralities, we can have little reaſon to expect the Divine Goodneſs ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:65022:10"/>
ſhower down Bleſſings upon us, but rather have a fearful Expectation of Iudgment for our Impieties, Sin being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the forerunner thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before it be too late, then may we with Comfort look up: For God doth not willingly afflict the Children of Men, or any <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> but for the Sins of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> thereof; <hi>For like as a Father pitieth his Children, ſo is the Lord merciful unto them that fear him: For he knoweth the Frame of Man that he is but Duſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the generality of People among us ſeem much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd as to publick Affairs, otherwiſe than in hearing and telling of News: But let every individual perſon be well aſſured, that a great Duty and Obligation lies upon him in reference to the obtaining National Mercies and Bleſſings; and it cannot be conceived that a bare Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a Monthly Faſt (during the time of Action) can obtain them; for we can never expect them, unleſs we daily and fervently beg them of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us with all Humility wraſtle and contend with him for a Bleſſing upon this Land; but firſt let us do all Acts of Mercy and Compaſſion, then may we with the greater Aſſurance approach the Throne of Grace.</p>

                        <p>But yet notwithſtanding, there's an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of preſerving our Coaſting Trade, for the ſupplying <hi>London</hi> and other Parts with Coles, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There's no Arguments I can offer will bear any thing like unto matter of Fact; and if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will be pleas'd to look back to the preceding years, you will find, That after their Majeſties Fleet hath been fully Mann'd, and at Sea, there hath bin notwithſtanding no want of Sailers to carry on the Coaſting Trade, as it hath evidently appear'd; and when it hath met with Obſtructions, it hath been occaſion'd by having ſo many Privateers on the Coaſt, and the want of neceſſary Convoys: So that its apparent that there is a ſufficient Body of Sailers whereby to anſwer the Ends of the Government, and the Neceſſities of Trade, as will be farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in this enſuing Diſcourſe, with the Cauſe why the Publick is not more timely ſerv'd; and the Reaſons of it ſeem to be plain: For there are a very great number of Sailers that abſcond and hide, till ſuch time the Fleet is out; and if they can afterwards uſe the Coaſting Trade, or make ſome Voyage for five or ſix Months time, they will get more Mony than the Kings Pay will amount to in the whole year,
<pb facs="tcp:65022:11"/>
and have their Pay ſo ſoon as their Voyage is over; whereas the Publick is always in Arrears, and its but Natural for every Man to purſue his own Intereſt: And withall, theſe Men are not unſenſible that if they loſe their Limbs, or are Maim'd, that the Fate of them generally is, that they become Vagabonds, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they receive the Kings Pay during Life; it not being a ſufficient Maintenance. The Sailers thus uſing all the Induſtry they can to avoid the publick Service, and the ways taken to bring them in being ſo Dilatory. Indeed, the want of due Convoys is the Grand Occaſion of the Exorbitant Wages now given in the Coaſting Trade.</p>
                        <p>As to the Outward-bound Shipping, who carry off the Product of the Country, it muſt muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd on all Hands, that they ought to have the Preference above all others, ſo far as is Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Government: For its the Foreign Trade that makes this Nation Potent and Happy, and not that within our ſelves: It's from thence all our Riches flow; 'tis that which brings the Bullion and Coin into the Kingdom. Beſides, our Plantations abroad cannot ſubſiſt without frequent Supplies from us; and of what great Conſequence they are I need not ſay. And 'tis our Outward Trade which is a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to a great part of the Body of the People of this Kingdom; and if that be long obſtructed, they muſt Languiſh. Therefore if any hardſhip muſt lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:65022:12"/>
Shipping, it may, with ſubmiſſion, I think be rather thrown upon the Coaſting Trade, as being the leaſt Evil, and the ſooneſt Remitted.</p>
                        <p>For ſuppoſe Coals are now at Thrity Shillings a Chaldron, and by reaſon that the Government Preſs ſo many of the Colliers Men, that few Ships paſs between <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> for which reaſon they run up to Fifty Shillings a Chaldron; it would not be long before this might be Remitted, (if there be but due Convoys, and ſome Frigats conſtantly to Cruiſe on the Northern Coaſt) for the People that live upon the Coaſt will be drawn into the Service by reaſon of the great. Wages given; And there is Shipping frequently coming in, which would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Colliers. In <hi>September</hi> the great Ships are uſually laid up, and thoſe Men may be diſmiſt; and then there could be no want: However, it was never yet known that we ſuffer'd in our Coaſting Trade through the want of Men. But the fear that Men have bin in of being Preſs'd, or having many Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers on the Coaſt, and not having neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys: Theſe have bin the only and true Cauſes of it when it hath happen'd. We ſee in this our Age al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Arts and Sciences greatly improved, and why not things of this Nature; and I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that if thoſe Propoſitions I have made were put in execution, it would not only much expedite our Publick Affairs, but alſo encourage and enliven Trade during this War.

Some Time after the Delivery of this, I did wait on their Lordſhips, deſtring to know the Reſult of the Matter; and they were pleaſed to give me a very obliging Anſwer; which was this: That the Fleet was out; and they could not now put my Propoſitions in Execution; when they did, I ſhould hear from them.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>IN my Propoſitions which lie before your Lordſhips, I ſay, That when the Great Ships are laid up, thoſe Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on Board may be diſcharged: and the Seaſon of the Year now coming on for ſo doing, I conceive my ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give my Reaſons for it, in regard it will greatly promote their Majeſties and the Publick Intereſt; and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, that when theſe Men are diſmiſs'd, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will have no Occaſion for them till Spring follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and if it be but calculated what the Charge will be in keeping them in Pay till that Time, it will be found to be an immenſe Sum. No Objection can be made whereby to hinder or retard the doing it, but the Exigents the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may afterwards be driven to for want of theſe Men. But Arguments have and ſhall be given, to prove that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly happen. Therefore whatever Hardſhip or Preſſures may other ways lie, ſome Expedient muſt be found for Raiſing Money to pay theſe Men, ſo as they go off ſatisfied. This will not only be ſaving the King and Kingdom great Sums of Money, but there will naturally ariſe from it, that which will be of Publick Advantage: for many of them will fall to the Coaſting Trade; by which means Coals and other Goods will be kept or brought down to moderate Rates. Some may take to Privateer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which, if duely encourag'd, will encreaſe the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and be of great Uſe to the Nation; for they willnot only annoy the Enemy, but be a Protection to our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Coaſting Trade: Others will make Voyages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
<pb facs="tcp:65022:13"/>
as, to <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. and return before the Government will have Occaſion for them: and a Nation depending ſo much upon Trade as we do, the uttermoſt Diligence and Induſtry muſt be uſed to preſerve it: and I humbly conceive, that it hath now more fully appear'd, that there is a ſufficient Number of Sailers to anſwer the Ends of Government and Trade; as hath been apparently evident this Summer, as well as the preceding Years; for when the Royal Navy was fully Mann'd and at Sea, there was a very great Fleet of Outward-bound Ships that then Sail'd; and at the ſame Time above 600 Sail of <hi>Colliers</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that uſe the <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Trade, (beſides other Coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) as appears by the <hi>Gazettes</hi> of the 8th and 12th of <hi>June</hi> laſt. Moreover, we had ſeveral Fleets came in from abroad the ſame Month; and at the ſame time had Shipping in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Parts of the World: and no ſooner was the Grand Fleet out, but the Wages in the <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Trade ſunk 30 <hi>s.</hi> a Voyage, and in all Probability had fallen much lower, had it not been for the many Privateers which all along in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the Coaſt. All which gives undeniable Evidence that there is no Want of Men; and that when the Seaſon of the Year comes, thoſe Propoſitions I have made may be put in Execution, without any poſſibility of Damage to Trade: It's ſo far from that, that a great deal of Good will flow from it. And I conceive I can no ways better make it appear, than in firſt laying open the Ill that attends the making Uſe of the Preſs-Ketches, which will we found to be of very ill Conſequence to the Government, and pernicious to Trade. Theſe may ſeem to be very harſh Terms; but doubt not but your Lordſhips will find I ſhall make good the Charge; for when they have received their Warrants for Impreſſing of Men, and ſail to ſome Port (they no ſooner appear but the Sailers abſcond for Reaſons before given) where they continue for ſome time; when they ſail away, in ſome ſmall time others come into Port; ſometimes two or three; ſo for the moſt part it continueth thus the Winter Seaſon.
<pb facs="tcp:65022:13"/>
The Spring coming on, and the Government finding a want of Sailers for Manning the Royal Navy, lay an <hi>Embargo</hi> to ſuch a Time, (in the <hi>Interim</hi> theſe Ketches are employ'd to get them); that being expir'd, yet ſtill they want; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Embargo</hi>'s renew'd to a longer time; and that being expir'd, yet they have not their Complement of Men: So that the <hi>Embargo</hi>'s renew'd from Time to Time; (or if it be one continued <hi>Embargo</hi> without Limitation it's the ſame). All this ariſes from the Dilatorineſs of the Preſs-Ketches; for the Government can do no leſs than lay an <hi>Embargo</hi> when there is a Want of Men (our Fleet, under God, being the greateſt Security we have). But by theſe Means the Merchants are exceedingly diſcourag'd, and prevented in making their ſeveral Voyages; which they might do, and return before the Government had Occaſion for the Men. Likewiſe their Majeſties Revenues are greatly impair'd, by not having thoſe Duties paid (both Inward and Outward) which otherwiſe would be: and the Nation ſuffers exceedingly, in not having that Vend for their native Commodities that otherwiſe they might. All which muſt conſequently impoveriſh the People.</p>
                        <p>We are happy in our Situation, in not being liable to the Incurſions of the Enemy; and expos'd to that Ravage our neighbouring Nations have felt and undergone, from the Hands of a barbarous and cruel Foe. But we ſhall have no Cauſe to fear them, if we take but ſuch Meaſures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to protect our Trade from their Privateers, which greatly afflict all the Coaſt (which they always pour out upon us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have laid up their great Ships; and by their late Attempt upon the <hi>Streights</hi> Fleet, it's viſible they more aim to ruin our Trade than to Fight us). Then would Mony cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate well at home, the Subject be made eaſie, and Trade flouriſh. And did we conſider the Large Sea-Coaſts of this Kingdom, with the many Ports and Harbours therein, with the numerous Body of Seafaring People thereof; we might rationally conclude, that there is no Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> able
<pb facs="tcp:65022:14"/>
to equip ſuch a Fleet to Sea as we are, if we take but proper Methods; and their Majeſties may be as abſolute Soveraigns of the <hi>Britiſh Seas</hi> as ever their Predeceſſors were when the Laws of <hi>Oleron</hi> were made.</p>
                        <p>In all that I have ſaid, I have no Deſign of Reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Perſons, by thus expoſing thoſe Methods that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for they are the ſame that our Forefathers us'd, and from them we receiv'd 'em; ſo none to be blam'd: But if it appear better may be taken, that will prove more uſeful, it cannot but be thought reaſonable to lay them aſide.</p>
                        <p>But by ſo doing its not improbable, but that it may ruin the Intereſt of ſome well-deſerving perſons; however, theirs muſt not ſtand in Competition, being Incompatible with that of the Publick, and the Government may other ways make them Compenſation. I will humbly ſuppoſe now, that were the time and ſeaſon proper to put thoſe Propoſitions in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and it were accordingly done, it would be found, that there would be more Men taken than the King would have occaſion for; ſo that many of them might be diſcharged.</p>
                        <p>The Conſequence of this would be, that all Embargo's would Ceaſe that are occaſion'd by the King's want of Men; then all Shipping will be free, and Trade laid open; and the Merchant and Coaſter will ſoon be ſupply'd with Men, as hath appeared. And when theſe Men are in Cuſtody, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping may be taken up in each Port, to Convoy them to thoſe where their Majeſties Ships Ride; and be Convoy'd by ſome Frigats appointed for that purpoſe: Then thoſe Veſſels may be Diſcharged. By theſe means a vaſt Charge will be cut off which attended the Preſs-Ketches, (Calculated by Cap. <hi>St. Lo</hi> at 60000 l. <hi>per an.)</hi> and that heavy Burden that lay upon Trade, occaſioned by the uſe of them, will be thrown off, and the Merchants left to purſue their ſeveral Voyages.</p>
                        <p>I have no deſire to appear in Print, being only Ambitious to ſerve their Majeſties, whoſe Innate Goodneſs is ſuch, that I have no Reaſon to doubt, but that they will be pleaſed to extend their moſt gracious Favour towards me.</p>

               <p>That the Surveyor of each Port give Advice to the Lords of the Admiralty, what Men he hath in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, that timely care may be taken that they be ſent to thoſe Ports, where Their Majeſties Ships Ride, and that the Collector of each Port pay the charge of the Impreſs'd Men during their being in Cuſtody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objections</hi> may be Rais'd, more than I am capable to diſcover: One will be, <hi>That it will obſtruct the King's Buſineſs, and bring an Inconveniency upon the Merchant.</hi> I conceive it will do neither; for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>Cuſtom Houſe</hi> are oblig'd, by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to give their Attendance but at ſuch and ſuch Hours, and there is a great part of the Day wherein they may do the King's Buſineſs in this Affair; and it will be much eaſier for them to do it, than any other Perſons.</p>
               <p>And with all due Submiſſion, I cannot ſee any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of making uſe of the <hi>Preſs-Ketches</hi> for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for in effect, every Surveyor in each Port acts the ſame thing, ſo that it may be ſaid, That there is a <hi>Preſs-Ketch</hi> in every Port of the Kingdom, beſides the Officers on ſhoar. If theſe Methods are taken, then there will be no occaſion of taking up Looſe and Labouring People in <hi>London,</hi> as is practis'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year, who not being Inur'd to the Sea, in a little
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65022:16"/>
time, ſerve to no other end, than to fill the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and breed Diſtempers on Shipboard. And this may be executed with as much eaſe, as laying an <hi>Imbargo;</hi> for the Saylers cannot poſſibly avoid being taken; for they may very well be compar'd to Amph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Creatures, who, as they cannot long live out of the water; no more can they long ſubſiſt out of ſome Port: This will give the Government an opportunity of being at Sea, ſo ſoon as they ſhall think fit; from whence much good will enſue to the Publick, and to Trade, by having our Merchants Protected.</p>

            <head>PROPOSITIONS Humbly Offered For the Support and Maintenance Of all ſuch SAYLERS That ſhall be <hi>Wounded or Maim'd</hi> In the Publick Service, (Including all Privateers) Or in defence of our Ships of Trade.</head>

            <div type="introductory_commments">
               <p>BY all the obſervations I can make from that little reading which I have had, I apprehend the <hi>Roman</hi>'s to have been the Nobleſt and the moſt generous People that have been in any Age; and who took great care, and made proviſion for thoſe who were wounded in their ſervice, by plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65022:17"/>
them in Colonies, and giving them a competent Maintenance, which was no doubt a great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Soldiery, and one grand cauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of their Territories, which in the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was grown to a great extent.</p>
               <p>And that Governmenr that will expect to arrive to any Potency, muſt give all due incouragement and rewards, to ſuch as are inſtruments of promoting the ſame. And the Grandure and Power of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> and welfare of the People depending ſo much upon Trade, all imaginable incouragement ſhould be given to Shipping and Saylers who bring the Riches into the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And, I conceive, we have been much wanting to our ſelves, in not making due proviſion for the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; therefore judge it a thing highly neceſſary to be looked into, being that which will greatly promote Navigation, and increaſe their Numbers.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſedulous in taking care to provide for their Souldiery, ſo much the more ought we to ſtudy the intereſt of the Saylers upon whom the welfare of theſe Kingdoms doth very much depend. The matter that I have to propoſe on their hebalf is, that ſuch of them as ſhall loſe their Limbs or be maimed in the publick Service, or in defence of our Ships of Trade (and ſo made uncapable of getting their Livelihood) may have due Proviſion made for them during Life, and to be punctually paid quarterly; which will not only be an inducement to Men to be bold and brave on board the Royal Navy, but it will likewiſe make them reſolute in Defence of our Merchant-men; as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65022:17"/>
knowing if they have the misfortune to be Maimed or loſe their Limbs, they ſhall have a competent Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made for them; and I would humbly propoſe to extend this ſo far, that if any Man be ſlain, and leave a Wife and two or three Children behind him (as it may be the Caſe of many) they ſhall receive the ſame Penſion for ſeven years as if he were living; and all this may be done without any Charge to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And thoſe who are concern'd will have no juſt cauſe of complaint: So that this would plainly be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to many thouſands of People to take to the Sea, who are now afraid of it, for fear of loſing their Limbs, and becoming Vagabonds, whereas, on Shore, they live free from any ſuch danger; but if ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion were made, that Obſtacle would be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>And I not only conceive it to be the Intereſt of the Nation, but an Action humane and Chriſtian; to make Proviſion for ſuch, as are not capable of doing it themſelves.</p>
               <p>And I do apprehend there will much good and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantages ariſe from this Charity, much more than is to be diſcern'd at firſt ſight, and will have a great influence many ways.</p>
               <p>By it many Merchant men will be prevented falling into the Enemies Hands.</p>
               <p>For as things now ſtand the Saylers can have little Courage to fight and oppoſe the Enemy, knowing if
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65022:18"/>
they are Maim'd they are utterly ruin'd, notwithſtanding they do beat off the Enemy; for if the Owners do but pay them their Wages, its as much as they are oblig'd to.</p>
               <p>And certainly there can be no greater hardſhip in the World than theſe poor Mens caſe is, who by their courage and bravery often preſerve the Merchants effects, and bring great Riches into the Kingdom, and at the ſame time it's there unhappy fate to loſe their Limbs, and by it are ever after made Miſerable: This is too much Matter of Fact and Truth.</p>
               <p>And no doubt it's the apprehenſion of theſe things that makes many Ships reſign to the Enemy, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt loſs is their Wages, and they will not venture their Limbs for other Men.</p>
               <p>There's juſt reaſon to believe this, for we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances of ſome of our ſhipping who have defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves from the <hi>Algerines,</hi> and other Pirates to admiration, and bravely acquitted themſelves from them to their great Honour, and advantage of their Merchants and Owners; but it was not ſo much love to them as kindneſs to themſelves, that made them ſo reſolute, being ſenſible what miſery they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, if they ſhould be taken. So we ſee the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of miſery will make Men ſtout, and Rewards will have the ſame effect; but if they are in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by our Enemies Privateers, they have now no ſuch fear upon them, and their loſs not great, ſo that they will not venture their lives to that degree, they might and ought for the good of the publick only, for want of that due incouragement that Men ſhould have; and if there were ſuch proviſion made for them, no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65022:18"/>
Men under the Copes of Heaven would be more bold and brave; and it's but for Bread that theſe poor Men Plow the Seas, and if they have a reaſonable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of injoying that, they will fear nothing.</p>
               <p>And we cannot grutch them that which Principally proceeds from their own labours.</p>
               <p>And things being thus eſtabliſhed upon theſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations will be an extraordinary incouragement for Men to take to the Seas, as ſeeing a fairer proſpect of raiſing themſelves that way, than by any labour or ſervice by Land.</p>
               <p>Having this aſſurance, that if they ſhould be Maim'd yet they ſhould not want.</p>
               <p>Which is that which Men generally fear more than Death.</p>
               <p>And one great advantage may be made to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by this being paſt into an Act, <hi>viz.</hi> that by theſe means, that all Saylers whatever that have Pay due to them from the Government, ſhall relinquiſh one moiety; and this can no ways appear any hardſhip up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: For what Man is there under their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that would not willingly withgo a greater debt, that by ſo doing ſhall be aſſured of a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for Life, in caſe he grow into years and paſt labour, or happen to be maim'd, and ſo made uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of getting his Livelihood; they can lay no claim to it, ſo can pretend no Title to it; therefore it's but reaſonable they ſhould make an acknowledgment to the Government, for paſſing ſuch an Act in their favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65022:19"/>
This would ſoon reduce the extravagant ways that Saylers now have, and in little time they would fall to the old rate, notwithſtanding it be time of War, which would be a great benefit to all Coaſters, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Owners, as likewiſe an eaſe to the People in General. We may in great meaſure judg the benefit that may be reap'd by this being paſt into an Act, by taking notice of the ſeveral Offices erected in this Town for the Inſurance of Houſes from Fire, particularly that which is called the Friendly Society, where ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have mutually ſubſcribed to each other upon ſuch conditions, as its look'd upon to be a very good Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for many perſons may help one or two with little detriment to themſelves, which otherwiſe would be ruin'd: But this is a matter more extenſive, as being National, and of much greater conſequence than they are; but differs not much in nature, being an Inſurance as well as they, and ſo properly enough may be called Inſurance Mony.</p>
               <p>And it's paſt all diſpute or controverſy, that all due incouragement ſhould be given to Saylers ſo far as is conſiſtent with their Circumſtances and the rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>If an Abſtract be but taken of all Entries made in all Ports of the Kingdom for one year, then a true eſtimate may be made, and all errors remov'd; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what this following Act of Tunnage may amount to.</p>

               <p>That the Collector in each Port receive and keep this Mony from Quarter to Quarter, and give ſecurity for the ſame; but be liable to give an accompt, and pay it to the Truſtees in each Port, who ſhall be ordered to diſpoſe of the ſame; and ſome one of thoſe Truſtees ſhall give ſecurity to the Overſeers, becauſe there may be growing Mony in his Hands which otherwiſe may be imbeziled; and that theſe Truſtees ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be liable to give an accompt to the ſaid Over-ſeers, when and ſo often as they ſhall think fit. By theſe means all abuſes and corruptions may be prevented.</p>
               <p>That the Collector of each Port give to the Maſter of every reſpective Veſſel, a Receipt for this Mony without Fee; and that he carry this to the Jerker for him to enter upon it the ſaid Maſter and Saylers Names, with the Name of the Ship on which they are on Board,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65022:20"/>
this to be done without Fee, and to be filed and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred. Now this will be a great help to the Sayler, in his proving on what Veſſel he was on Boar'd, and likewiſe be a means to prevent their impoſing upon the Truſtees: But it ſhall be lawful for each Collector to deduct three pence in the Pound out of all Monies paſſing through his Hands, to be diſpos'd of, as ſhall be thought fit for his and the Jerkers trouble in this affair.</p>
               <p>It being a matter deſigned for the good of the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and not to the advantage of any Port where the Mony is paid (further than for the uſe of the Saylers allotted to them by Act of Parliament) ſo that if there be any overplus of Mony in <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> or any other Port without exception; it ſhall be lawful for the Over-ſeers to take it, to ſupply the Wants of others: The intention of the thing being to relieve the want of the Saylers in general; but if there be any overplus of Mony beyond this, it ſhall farther be in the ſaid Over-ſeers power to build Hoſpitals in the ſeveral Ports, for the uſe of the wounded Saylers, or the Widows and Children of ſuch as are ſlain, or ſuch of them as are antient and paſt their labour; but then they ſhall be built in thoſe Ports where the Mony was raiſed.</p>
               <p>That twenty Over-ſeers or more be nominated, and they to be Perſons of Honour, to overlook and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect into the actions of the Truſtees; and if it appear to them that they have abus'd their truſt, then it ſhall be in their power, or any ten of them (without any ſute at Law) to nominate others, however they ſhall live in or near the Port; that a Clark be aſſigned to the Over ſeers, who ſhall keep in a Book fairly written, an accompt of all the Ports in the Kingdom,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65022:21"/>
and the ſeveral Collectors thereof ſhall tranſmit to him every Quarter, an accompt of what Monies they have paid to the Truſtees, and they likewiſe quarterly to give him an accompt of the Names of the ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that they have paid the Charity to; and this ſhall be laid before the Over ſeers twice in a year at leaſt; and that three pence in the Pound be allowed in each Port out of all Monies received, to be for a Sallary to the ſaid Clark.</p>
               <p>Whereas Saylers often ſhift Ships, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon one Voyage, ſometimes another, great care muſt be taken, that by this means they do not receive the Charity in more Ports than one: The like care that they be not put to too great trouble of proving their being wounded on boar'd ſuch a Ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be admitted; it may be a great hardſhip, to a Man that's maim'd, Poor and Friendleſs: The ſame care muſt be taken in reference to thoſe that ſhall be ſlain; that the Truſtees have not Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren impos'd upon them.</p>
               <p>If a Sayler have loſt a Limb, or is otherways Maim'd, (ſo as to be render'd uncapable of Service) then the Truſtees to pay him, or them, according to the Fund they have; but yet not to exceed Twelve Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> that being a competent Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for a poor Man.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that are Maim'd in the Publick Service ſhall reap the advantage of this, he, or they, being to be reckon'd to that Port out of which he was taken, when he enter'd into Their Majeſties Service, a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter being kept in each Port for that purpoſe; this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65022:21"/>
will ſoon take off the Saylers Averſion to the Publick Service, and greatly promote Their Majeſties Intereſt, theſe Men enjoying Two Charities, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will never withdraw their uſual Bounty they have all along given to Saylers, and it will be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible means of keeping them from taking Foreign Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; he that is firſt Wounded to take place before all others; this Method to be obſerv'd in all Ports.</p>
               <p>And in little time there might be very good Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals built in all the conſiderable Ports of the Kingdom, to the great Relief of the Poor, and to the Intereſt and Honour of the Nation.</p>
               <p>The Saylers on Board all outward-bound Ships, and Coaſters, ſhall be adjudg'd to that Port where they took their laſt Clearing, and paid their Charity-Mony: All inward bound Ships ſhall be charg'd to thoſe Ports to which they are bound; and if by misfortune ſome of them fall into the Enemies Hands, and their Men Maim'd, yet notwithſtanding thoſe Men ſhall have a Right to the Charity, and receive it in that Port to which that Veſſel was bound.</p>

               <p>I have now done with my Propoſitions, and ſhall only bring an Example, or Two, that it may appear how eaſie the thing will be; we may ſuppoſe, that all Veſſels from <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> that are above One Hundred Tun, will have one with another Eight Saylers; ſo here is Twelve Pence to be paid by each Perſon, which is but One Penny Half Penny a Man each Voyage; and it's poſſible, they may make Eight in a Year, which is but Twelve Pence a Man for the whole Year.</p>

Likewiſe all outward and inward bound Ships, that are upwards of One Hundred Tun, one with another, will have Twelve Saylers on board, and Four Shillings to be paid by them, which is Four Pence a Man each Voyage, which they would chearfully and readily pay.</p>
               <p>And all Owners of Shipping would willingly pay what is charg'd upon the Bottom; for by this Act their Men will be made Reſolute in defence of their Veſſels, and it will be a very great Inducement and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them, to ſet them out to Sea better Arm'd and Man'd then now they do.</p>
               <p>This would make a great Revenue, and which would be a vaſt help to all the Ports in the Kingdom, and the whole Nation would ſoon feel the happy effects of it.</p>

            <head>A Supplement To the Foregoing PROPOSITIONS.</head>
            <p>IT may be expected I ſhould make an Eſtimate what Fund may Annually ariſe towards Building of Hoſpitals: It is a hard Task to perform, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome helps from the Government, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that neither I, or any one elſe, can make a true Eſtimate; but according to my Apprehenſion, it cannot amount to leſs than Thirty Thouſand Pounds a Year.</p>
            <p>And great things may be done by reaſon of this Fund, which will continue as well in Peace as War, and great Improvements may be made beyond what I have done, which in ſome meaſure you may diſcern, but I want time to Explain.</p>
            <p>As that there may and ought Proviſion to be made for Commanders of the King's Ships, or Maſters of Veſſels, (that are fallen to decay, that have behav'd themſelves Honourably, and deſerv'd well of the State,) ſuitable to their Merits; and ſuch Perſons to be Governors of the ſeveral Hoſpitals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65022:23"/>
And others that have behav'd themſelves well, and in defence of their Ships, and done ſomething that's Great, and deſerves Praiſe and Imitation, and wants not this Charity, theſe to be Preſented with a Gold Chain and Medal, with ſome Motto ſuitable to the Action; and this ſhall be put on in the preſence of the Overſeers; and after this he ſhall ever have the power to Act as a Truſtee in all the Ports of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and for One Year ſhall have the Honour to be admitted to act as an Over ſeer, and have an equal Vote.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe it will be neceſſary to put out the Children of ſuch Commanders or Maſters of Ships that are either ſlain or Maim'd; but this Power muſt be lodg'd in the Over-ſeers, otherways there will be great Corruption and abuſes in this Affair.</p>
            <p>And when its fix'd and ſettled by Act of Parliament, then will it by conſequence greatly improve the Trade of the Nation and the Revenue of the Crown; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of Shipping and Saylers.</p>
            <p>Then will not the Gentry and middle ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be ſo greatly averſe to the bringing up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Saylers, as now they are; but it's through a wrong notion they have of things, that makes them have ſuch mean thoughts of Sea-Imployments; neither are they ſo terrible and frightful as ſome apprehend.</p>
            <p>We ſee the generality of People that give their Children Competent Fortunes, put them out to Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping, Trades or Handicrafts; by which means they are made ſo numerous, that Trade cannot ſupport all;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65022:23"/>
and Men thereby fall to decay; and Seeing Ruin hanging over their Heads, run into exceſs, and ſo haſten their downfall; and it may be in a few years return to their Friends to be kept, and bring a Wife and two or three Children to boot (there are multitudes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Truth of this) which muſt certainly be a great affliction to the Parent, and a continual Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore and Vexation to him: and the Poor ruin'd Man receives the Scorn and Frowns of his Friends, which he's forced to diſgeſt pierce although it his very Reins; ſo he lingers out a miſerable ignominous Life.</p>

            <p>Therefore if Gentlemen would but bring up their younger Sons to learn Navigation, and afterwards put them for two or three years to a Captain of one of the King's Men of War, or to ſome Eminent Maſter of a Ship, that he may underſtand the Duty of a Sayler; then would his Coat ſit never the worſe upon his Back, but the better, when he's grown Man; and then will he be qualified for his Princes ſervice, or at leaſt, need not fear having a good Ship, and of raiſing his Fortune.</p>

               <p>WHen the Kingdom is ingag'd in War, its not only requiſite but equitable that all Perſons, according to their ſeveral Degrees and Qualities ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Immergencies of the State; all due Regard being firſt had to Husbandry and Trade; and wherein things do not obſtruct or Impeed either, its but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
               <p>And, indeed there are many whoſe Eſtates and Effects lie in Shipping, who have no ways yet contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted any thing to the Publick, during the whole Courſe of this War; and who are under good circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and capable of paying Taxes proportionable to the Reſt of the King's Subjects, and no Injury thereby done.</p>

They may, its true, plead they are at great Charge to the Light-houſes, and by Convoy mony, which is no hardſhip upon them, it being brought in upon the Merchant as Averidg.</p>
               <p>Unleſs it fall upon Colliers, and it's well known they get a great deal of Mony, notwithſtanding all the Charge they are at, and the great Wages they give.</p>
               <p>And it may further be object'd by them, That they are liable to great Dangers, and many of them taken by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>All which is no more than what the Merchants are expos'd to; whoſe Effects are generally of much greater Conſequence than their Shipping, yet are no ways exempt'd from paying greater Duties both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward; notwithſtanding any great Loſſes they have had, or may hereafter meet withal.</p>
               <p>Therefore, it ſeems altogether unreaſonable, that theſe Perſons ſhould be exempted from being Tax'd, when there may thereby be ſo much Mony Rais'd as will be of great Importance to the Government.</p>
               <p>But that things may be done with all due Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no good Subject ſhall have any juſt Cauſe of Complaint, and not one Tax'd more than another; it would be requiſite, I humbly conceive, to have an Act of Parliament made to lay it as a Tunnage, with due regard being had to the Burthen and Voyage of each Ship, and to make a Diſtinction between Coaſters and Veſſels outward bound, according to theſe inſuing Propoſitions.</p>

               <p>That all Coaſters whatever <hi>(except Collyers)</hi> pay ſix pence per Tun to the Collector of each Port where he takes his lading, according as the Ship ſhall meaſure; but if he ſhall not have his full lading, then a Deduction to be made according to what he wants; or if he ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards have the Misfortune to fall into the Hands of the Enemies, then he ſhall have the liberty to draw back what Tunnage he paid that Voyage, and be paid upon demand, or be allow'd it by Debenter, and have twelve Months time ſo to do, after the loſs of the ſaid Ship: But all Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers ſhall pay this Tunnage in that Port they break Bulk and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nload: unleſs it be ſuch of them as are outward bound.

               <p>This will Create them no great Trouble, and will be an Eaſe to the Government; neither can it be any Hardſhip to them to pay this Mony; the leaſt of them having been at far greater Charge the Preceeding Years, then they will be the Enſuing; and then their Trade and Buſineſs was greatly obſtructed, but now they will be no way moleſted.</p>
               <p>That the Collector of each Port ſhall keep this Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage-Accompt a part (as likewiſe the Charity-Mony) and it ſhall be wholly a ppropriated to the uſe of the Navy: This Mony being thus receiv'd, by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, will prevent the great and uſual Charge that attends the Gathering in of Taxes, and will be the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Government many Thouſands of Pounds.</p>
               <p>According to my weak Capacity, This ſeems, to me, to be a very facile and eaſy way of raiſing very great Sums of Mony, and be no manner of Oppreſſion of any Man; and ſhall bring an Inſtance or two which, in ſome meaſure will prove it.</p>
               <p>A Veſſel from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> (whoſe Tunnage is great) of two hundred Tun; will bring one hundred Tun of Goods, or Upwards, the Freight of which will amount to about two thouſand Pounds. And conſidering all their Ware and Tare, and the great Wages they give, it's evident they may very well pay the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forty Pounds when the Merchant at the ſame time hath run the ſame Riſque, and pays far greater Sums, and probably gets not ſo much by the Voyage as the Owners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65022:27"/>
And for the <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> and other Coaſting Trade, it can be no hardſhip for a Ship of two hundred Tun to pay five Pound, two Shillings (including the Charity Mony) in a Voyage; for in little time the Saylers Wages will ſink much lower than now they are, and they will be nothing at the Charge they now are at; neither will Coals, or other Goods, be any way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by it, but reduced to a lower Rate, ſo the Charity Act be but paſt, and the Government be not wanting in granting them conſtant due and neceſſary Convoys; and if that be but Effectually done, there are no Owners of Shipping will be concern'd at all for this Charge put upon them, but will willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Neceſſities of the Government, that the Trade of the Nation may be protected and preſerved.</p>
