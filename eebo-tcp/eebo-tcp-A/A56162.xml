            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Hiſtoria Jeſuitica,</hi> l. 4. f. 244, 245. reckons up theſe
three prime cauſes of the Jeſuites <hi>Regicides,</hi> &amp; other <hi>Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Treaſons. The firſt is, that blinde Obedience, which
they vow to their Superiours, to execute with great celerity,
ſpiritual joy, and perſeverance, whatever their Superiours
ſhall enjoyne them, by being perſwaded, <hi>That all their Cem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are Iuſt</hi> to them; by renouncing their own Opinion and
Iudgement with a certain <hi>Blinde Obedience:</hi> and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that thoſe who live under Obedience, are carried and
governed</hi> by Divine Providence, (a word now moſt in uſe
with our Army-Saints, and Souldiers, wholly infected
with this Jeſuitical Doctrine of<note n="*" place="margin">To their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral &amp; Officers, even in unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acts againſt the Parliament, King, Kingdom.</note> Obedience) <hi>by their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
whitherſoever they ſhall ſuffer themſelves to be carried, or
in what ſort ſoever they ſhall be dealt with by them, (like a ſtaffe

whereſoever and in what thing ſoever he will pleaſe to uſe it,</hi>)
eſpecially when backed with a pretext of <hi>Neceſsity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
Safety, Publick</hi> Good, Exemplary Juſtice, and
promoting the common Cauſe for which their Society
was firſt inſtituted. 2. <hi>That they hold themſelves obliged to no
Kings, Princes, or Civil Magiſtrates by any Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but onely to the Pope and their Generals; and therefore
think themſelves free and unable to commit any Treaſon at all
againſt them, although at the Popes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtroy them. 3. That
they deem thoſe Kings, Princes, which the Pope and Jeſuites, or
<pb facs="tcp:61231:13"/>
other learned men of their Religion, or the common people ſhall
deem Hereticks, to be thereby wholly made uncapable of any
Empires, Kingdoms, or Principalities, or any other civil Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity;
yea, to be accurſed Tyrants, unworthy of the name of
Kings; that thereby their Subjects are totally abſolved from the
bond of Allegiance to them; and that thereupon it is lawful
to kill and deſtroy them, and the murders of ſuch are meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</hi>
Now that theſe three Jeſuitical Grounds and
Principles, (infuſed into our <hi>Army-Officers</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi>
by the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and their <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of late yeers, againſt
their Primitive Orthodox Poſitions, Proteſtations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,

for it with an affected devotion and ſolemne invocation (or

uttered theſe words to their Captain</hi> (as their parts directed

Pereat, Quiſquis eſt hoſtis Eccleſiae: <hi>Let him periſh, let

a great part of the Stage on which they acted, together with
the whole Popiſh Army (not one Souldier or Captain excepted)
at the repeating of theſe words and wiſhes, fell to the ground
immediately, with ſo great celerity, that many of them felt they
were fallen down, before they diſcerned themſelves to fall; their
feigned enemies of the Church (repreſenting the Proteſtants)
ſtanding all faſt, at leaſt in place, if not in mind, on the other part

with,</hi> and promote both their old and new deſigns againſt our
<hi>Church, State, Religion, Laws, Liberties,</hi> till they have brought
them and us to utter ruine. I ſhall for brevity ſake acquaint
you with one memorable general inſtance, diſcovering what
ſwarms of Jeſuites are now amongſt us, under other viſors.
An Engliſh Proteſtant Nobleman (a perſon of honor) whoſe
Anceſtors were Papiſts, being courteouſly entertained within
theſe two years at <hi>Rome</hi> by ſome eminent <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> in their chief
Colledge there, was brought by them into a Gallery having
Chambers round about it, with Titles over every door for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Kingdoms, and amongſt the reſt, one for <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
Upon which, he enquiring of the Ieſuits, <hi>what theſe titles ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified;</hi>
was anſwered by them, <hi>That they were the Chambers of
the Provincial Ieſuits, of each Kingdom and Province (written
ever the respective doors) wherein they had any members of their
<pb facs="tcp:61231:23"/>
ſociety now reſiding, who received all Letters of intelligence from
their Agents in thoſe places every week, and gave account of the
to the General of their Order. That the Provincial for</hi> England,
<hi>lodged in the Chamber over which the title</hi> ENGLAND <hi>was
written, who could ſhew him the laſt news from</hi> England: <hi>which
he deſiring to ſee,</hi> they thereupon <hi>knocked at the door, which was
preſently opened:</hi> the Provincial <hi>being informed who &amp; what
the Lord was,</hi> read <hi>the laſt news from</hi> England <hi>to them.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Nobleman demanded of them. <hi>Whether any of their
ſociety were now in</hi> England? <hi>&amp; how they could ſtay with ſafety,
or ſupport themſelves there,</hi> ſeeing <hi>moſt of the Engliſh Nobility,
Gentry, and Families that were Papiſts, were ruined in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
or ſequeſtred by the late wars &amp; troubles, ſo as they could
neither harbour, conceal nor maintain them, as they had done
heretofore?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>It was true; but the greater the
dangers and difficulties of thoſe of their ſociety now in</hi> England
<hi>were, the greater was their merit. And that</hi> they had then
above fiftéen hundred of their Society in England,<note place="margin">Nota,</note> able to
work in ſeveral Profeſsions &amp; Trades, which they had there
taken upon them, the better to ſupport &amp; ſecure themſelves
from being diſcovered; (who, together with ſome <hi>Popiſh
Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> no doubt, upon diligent inquiry will appear
to be the<note n="*" place="margin">See the Quakers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked.</note> chiefeſt <hi>Speakers, Quakers, Disputers, Seducers,

of all <hi>New Opinions,</hi> Blaſphemies, now abounding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

Reverend Divine more than once; to whom this Noble Lord,
upo his return into <hi>England</hi> not many Months ſince, ſeriouſly
related the Premiſes, <hi>averring the truth of them upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
Yet for all this, ſince the ſtupendious pretended repeals
and annihilations of the <hi>Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance,
&amp; that of Abjuration of Popery</hi> (conſented to by the late King
in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi>) purpoſely made for the better detection
and prevention of Ieſuites, and their treaſonable forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Populi:</hi> the element of all Laws, out of which they are
derived: the end of all Laws, to which they are deſigned,
and in which they are perfected.</p>
               <p>1. <q>It is an offence comprehending all other Offences.
Here you ſhall finde ſeveral Treaſons, Murthers, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
Oppreſſions, Perjuries. There is in this Crime, a
Seminary of all evils, hurtfull to a State; and if you
conſider the Reaſons of it, it muſt needs be ſo. The
Law, is that which puts a difference betwixt good and
evill; betwixt juſt and unjuſt. If you take away the
law, all things will fall into confuſion; every man will
become a law to himſelf,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> which in the depraved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of humane nature, muſt needs produce many
great enormities;<note n="*" place="margin">And are they not ſo now?</note> Luſt will become a Law; and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
will become a law; Covetouſneſſe and Ambition
will become laws; and what Dictates, what deciſions
ſuch laws will produce, may eaſily be diſcerned in the
late Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> (and <hi>England</hi> too ſince this.)
The law hath a power to prevent, to reſtrain, to repair
evils: without this all kindes of miſchiefs and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
will break in upon a State. It is the Law that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles
the King to the Allegiance and Service of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
it intitles the People to the Protection and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the King, &amp;c. <hi>The Law is the Boundary, the meaſure
betwixt the Kings Prerogative, and the Peoples Liberties;
whiles theſe move in their Orbe, they are a ſupport and ſecurity
to one another; but if theſe Bounds be ſo removed, that they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61231:69"/>
enter into conteſtation and conflict, one of theſe great
miſchiefs muſt needs enſue: if the Prerogative of the King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm
the Liberty of the people, it will be turned into Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
If Liberty undermine the Prerogative, it will turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Anarchy. The Law is the ſafegard, the cuſtody of all
private intereſts: your Honours, your Lives, your Liberties,
and your eſtates, are all in the keeping of the Law: without
this, every man hath a like Right to any thing: and this is
the condition into which the Iriſh were brought by the Earl of</hi>
Strafford; (and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by others who condemned
him) And the reaſon which he gave for it, hath more
miſchief than the thing it ſelf: THEY ARE A CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUERED
NATION, (let thoſe who now ſay the
ſame of <hi>England,</hi> as well as <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and obſerve what followes)</q> 
                  <hi>There cannot be a word
more pregnant and fruitfull IN TREASON, than that word is.
There are few Nations in the world, that have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and no doubt but the conquerour may give</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">And did not ſome at <hi>White-Hall</hi> do ſo of late, and now too witneſſe their volumes of new Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Edicts, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances there made.</note> 
                  <hi>what Laws he
pleaſe to thoſe that are conquered. But if the ſucceeding Parts
and Agreements do not limit and reſtrain that right, what people
can be ſecure?</hi> 
                  <q>England <hi>hath been conquered, and</hi> Wales <hi>hath
been conquered, and by this reaſon will be in little better caſe
than</hi> Ireland. <hi>If the King by the Right of a Conquerour give
Lawes to his people, ſhall not the people by the ſame reaſon be
reſtored to the Right of the conquered,</hi>
                  </q> to recover their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
if they can? What can be more hurtful, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
than ſuch Propoſitions as theſe?</p>
               <p>2. <q>It is dangerous to the Kings Perſon: and dangerous
to his Crown: it is apt to cheriſh ambition, uſurpation,
and oppreſſion in great men: and to beget ſedition, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
in the people, and both theſe have been, and in
reaſon muſt ever be great cauſes of trouble and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

1. <q>That of <hi>Thorp,</hi> was onely a ſelling of the Law by

Bribes, of theſe five perſons; the Paſſage of the Law

the Judges ought <hi>Judicium reddere,</hi> that is, the Lawes

               </p>
               <p>3. To excite all Lawyers (eſpecially ſuch, who of late

to examine their Conſciences, Actions, how far, all

of theſe <hi>Crimes</hi> and <hi>Treaſons,</hi> ſo highly aggravated, ſo

prolixity (the double <hi>Jury</hi> of irrefragable and punctuall
authorities already produced being ſufficient to ſatisfie
the moſt obſtinate oppoſites formerly contradicting it) I
ſhall onely adde three ſwaying authorities more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I ſhall conclude this point.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is a very late one, in a Treatiſe, intituled, <q>

in Reference to the late eſtabliſhed Government by a

Army Officers onely, not the people) uſe theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of them, page 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22. <q>But on
the contrary, it ſo fell out in a ſhort time, that there
appeared many in this Aſſembly of very contrary
principles to the intereſt aforeſaid, which led them
violently on to attempt and promote many things, the
conſequence whereof would have been,</q> A ſubverting of
the Fundamentall Laws of the Land, the Deſtruction of
Property, and an utter extinguiſhment of the Goſpel.
<hi>In truth their Principles led them</hi> TO A PULLING
DOWN ALL AND ESTABLISING NOTHING.
<q>So that inſtead of the expected ſettlement, they were
running into FURTHER ANARCHY AND CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUSION.
As to the Laws and Civil Rights of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nothing would ſerve them, but a TOTALL
ERADICATION OF THE OLD,
AND INTRODUCTION OF A NEW:</q>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:61231:78"/>
and ſo the <hi>good Old Laws of</hi> England (<hi>the Guardians of our

what could we have expected afterwards, but an
inthroning of Arbitrary power in the Seat of Judicature,
and an expoſing of our Lives, our Eſtates, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and all that is dear unto us, as a Sacrifice to the
boundleſſe appetite of meer Will and Power, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>2. The 6. <hi>Article</hi> of it is fatall and deſtructive to the
objected Articles; viz: <hi>That the Laws ſhall not be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſuspended, abrogated, or repealed, nor any New Law

the People, but by common conſent in Parliament.</hi>

and being not within the <hi>ſaving of this, or the</hi> 30th <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
muſt needs be void and repealed by this very ſixt
<hi>Article,</hi> and the <hi>Oath</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>3. The 30th <hi>Article</hi> following them, diametrically
contradicts, repeals them in theſe words. <hi>That <hi>the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Money</hi> for defraying the charges of preſent <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Forces both by Land and Sea,</hi> in respect of
<hi>the preſent warrs, ſhall be by conſent of Parliament:
Save only,</hi> that the Lord Protector, with the conſent of
the Major part of the Councel, for preventing the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and dangers which may otherwiſe fall out both at Sea
and Land, ſhall have <hi>power until the Meeting of the
firſt Parliament</hi>
                  </hi> (on the 3. <hi>September</hi> 1654.) <hi>to raiſe
Monies for the purpoſes aforeſaid.</hi> The former part
of this Article is conſonant to, and expounded by the 6.
forecited, which is more generall: and the plain ſenſe
thereof is this. <hi>That all monies raiſed for defraying the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61231:96"/>
Extraordinary Forces both by Land and Sea</hi> (exceeding
the antient ſtanding Garriſons, Guards maintained by
the old conſtant Revenues of the Crown, without any
Tax upon the People) <hi>ſhall be by conſent of parliament.</hi>
Therefore <hi>a fortiori;</hi> all perpetual ſtanding Taxes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
Contributions to maintain the ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Forces by Land or Sea, and ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
