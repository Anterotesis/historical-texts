            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And therefore as to a writ of right mordanceſtor Ayle, Aſsiſe, &amp;c. it ſhall be intended of an actuall ſeiſin, and not of a ſeiſin in Law, ſo that the three<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40663:90"/>firſt branches are to be intended of an actuall ſeiſin.</p>
            <p>And the fourth branch concerning Avowries extends to ſeiſins in law as well as to ſeiſins in fayt or actual ſeiſins.</p>
            <p>But the words upon which farther doubt may ariſe are contained in the 6. branch of the ſaid Statute in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> If any perſon or perſons do at any time ſue any of the ſaid acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. or make any avowry, &amp;c. and cannot prove that ſome of his anceſtors or predeceſſors were in actuall poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſeiſon of the ſaid lands, tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. within the time limited, &amp;c. if that be traverſed or denied by the plantiffe demandant, &amp;c. that after ſuch triall, the party and his heirs ſhall be barred to all ſuch Writs, actions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Upon which ſaid words it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;<note place="margin">Object.</note> that whereas at the Common Law before this Statute, a ſeiſin in Law was ſufficient for avowries, yet now by the expreſs words there muſt be an actual ſeiſin, for that the words (actual poſſeſsion or ſeiſin) excludes a ſeiſin in law; and the rather for that<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40663:90"/>an actuall ſeiſin is the ſure badge of right.</p>
            <p>But it was reſolved that a ſeiſin in law was ſufficient for an avowry within the intention of this Act: For the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Act was only to limit a time within which, ſeiſin ought to be had, and not to exclude any ſeiſin which was a good ſeiſin at the Common Law, as appeareth by the preamble of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: neither did the former Statutes of limitations of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 1. cap. 38. or of <hi>W.</hi> 2. cap. 2 &amp; 46. exclude a ſeiſin in Law, or any ſeiſin which was a ſufficient ſeiſin at the common Law. Alſo whereas the three firſt branches extend to actuall ſeiſin only; and the 4. branch extends as well to a ſeiſin law as to an actuall ſeiſin: And the ſixth Article ſpeaks by words diſ-junctive of actuall poſſeſsion or ſeiſin) makes a diſtinction betwixt actuall poſſeſsion, which referres to the three firſt bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſeiſin which referreth to the fourth branch, for that the words ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent are (in manner, and forme aforeſaid.</p>

            <p>As a ſigniory conſiſting upon hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and fealty only; for that the tenant may live above 60 years after that they were made: and ſo of caſuall ſervices, as to go to war with the Lord, and the like of a Formedon in diſcender, for that the tenant in taile may live 60 years after diſcontinuance, and albeit that the tenant in taile do dye, ſo that the iſſue may bring his Formedon within the time <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet that altreth not the caſe, but that the iſſue may bring his Formedon in diſcender at any time, as it was adjudged in <hi>Fitz Williams</hi> caſe, <hi>Dy.</hi> 278, and the ſame law is of homage and fealty and all other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall ſervices; or where there was an impoſſibility to have ſeiſin within the limitation. And in this caſe of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> it was agreed f. 11. <hi>a.</hi> that a Writ Eſolvert, Ceſſavit or Reſcous are not within this ſtatute, for that in thoſe Writs the ſeiſin as not traverſable but the tenure; and by thoſe VVrits the<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40663:91"/>land is demanded, and the demandant cannot alleadge any ſeiſin <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he commeth to them in the poſt.

            <p>And note that the 1. &amp; 2. clauſes of the ſtatute extend only to ſeiſin, Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrall,<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40663:92"/>and not to a writ of right of his own ſeiſin.

            <p>And foraſmuch as the ſervices of hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age &amp; fealty are not within this ſtatute, and that the ſeiſin of rent, or other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſervice is a ſeiſin of homage, and that likewiſe a ſeiſin of homage or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty is a ſeiſin of all ſervices annuall, or not annuall: that therefoee when the tenant hath done homage or fealty that ſhall be a ſeiſin of all other ſervices: as to Avowrie which of right ought to be made, notwithſtanding that the Lord or any by whom he claimeth have had ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin within 60 years. <hi>Co. l.</hi> 4 <hi>Bevils</hi> caſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The ſeiſin of the donee was never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable, nor intended to be within the ancient ſtatutes of limitations: for the Formedon was given after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſtatute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the firſt 10 years, but <hi>Welſh</hi> doubted hereof, <hi>Dy. f.</hi> 278. <hi>S.</hi> 2.3.</p>

               <hi>Cook</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Littleton f.</hi> 114. <hi>b.</hi> ſaith that limitation as it is taken in law, is a certain time preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by ſtatute; within the which the demandant in the action muſt prove himſelf or ſome of his anceſtors ſeiſed. And that in ancient time, the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a writ of right was from the time of <hi>H.</hi> 1. and was therefore alleaged to<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40663:94"/>be <hi>tempore H. ſenioris.</hi> Afterwards by the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was from the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and by the ſtatute of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> 1. the limitation was from the time of <hi>R.</hi> 1. which is the limitation that <hi>Littleton</hi> ſpeaketh of in his Booke of Tenures.
