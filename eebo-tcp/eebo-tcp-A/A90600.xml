         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PETITION
OF THE
Mayor and Inhabitants of
GRAVESEND,
TO THE
HONORABLE CITY of LONDON:</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat now at laſt, the long expected Plate-Fleet is ſafely arrived at this Town,
and having undone the Spaniard, is in a fair probability to ruine this place:
The which <hi>Cargo</hi> and <hi>Lading</hi> is <hi>Chalk,</hi> which is Landed and Ware-houſed
in every houſe throughout this Port, to our exceeding rejoycing and
utmoſt content.</p>
            <p>That we are of opinion, this place ſhould be called the <hi>Worlds-End;</hi>
for this muſt needs be the <hi>Day of Judgement</hi> upon us, for all our former
Unconſcionable Reckonings and Extortion. This is a ſecond <hi>Ninive</hi> to
which the <hi>Jonas</hi>'s cry Repentance; and ſo we would, but that their hearts
are ſo hardned, they will run on the Score Everlaſtingly.</p>
            <p>A Seaman without Money, is as great a Paradox, and a more perplexing Riddle to us, then all
the late Intricacies of State are pregnant: Would to God we had ſome of the Qualifications
here with us, we would make uſe of them; for now every pitiful Saylor thinks himſelf fit, and
ought to be truſted in the grand Concernments of Life, Eating and Drinking.</p>
            <p>Was there ever ſuch a thing known, as a Navy of the Kingdom to lie ſucking our Block-Houſes?
That Devilliſh <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> made this the <hi>New Mode;</hi> their Sins and Exorbitant
Practices muſt be landed at our Doors, and we muſt expiate their Extravagancies, with Want
and Indigencie: Every one here pretends to be the Commonwealth <hi>Searcher,</hi> and will pry into
our Cupboards; we have forgot the word <hi>Cocquet,</hi> and are for the backſide of the Book, we are
all cleared, and are Kentiſh Gentlemen: Adieu <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> we are to be redeemed by the
<hi>Navy-Office;</hi> for here is nothing but Ballaſt and Guns, that makes us appear like the Siege of
<hi>Cales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God Bleſs the Collier-Trade, for there's no hope of any other Merchandizing; when that
Fleet arrives, we intend to ſtay it, and make an <hi>Embargo,</hi> till we have Reparation and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be adviſed therefore, upon conſideration of the Premiſes, to forthwith expidite the payment of the
Aſſeſſment, for the preſent maintenance of the Fleet, as you will anſwer the contrary at your
pleaſure; or elſe ſend for the Ships up, and receive them for Pageants at your next great Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Show, or Bulge them and break them up, and let the broken Timber repair your Gates;
let that and the Walls of the Kingdom make up your Breeches.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And your Petitioners ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
