         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>YOV are to know, that the Author
(being no Scholar) had no design
to teach others, nor other Aims
by writing these his <hi>Mid-night Thoughts,</hi>
then by reviewing them, to keep up his own
heart to Heaven: But by this practice, he
grew to such a habit of Nightly Meditations,
(at his first waking) as prov'd more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
then sleep, and in a short time became
more delightful, then any other Thoughts
could entertain his mind with: So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intent to publish them, they swell'd
into this bulk you see; and brought him such
consolation, that he thought it Gods Mercy
to bring him this way to Heaven. And if
any Reader do find the like advantage, by
doing the like, he will have as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cause
to thank God as the Author has, who set his
fancy on work this way, to defend his heart
from indulging such vain Thoughts, as day
and night did formerly invade and seduce
him unto evil purposes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36884:3"/>
And on this account, the Author was
perswaded by some Friends, to transcribe
these loose Papers as they were first writ, and
tacked together, without any method of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
observed, (as appears by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
repetitions of the same expressions in
many of them;) yet they wish'd him to keep
them as they were, to shew how such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
men as himself, might better imploy
their busie fancies at all times, on the serious
thoughts of their Eternity, then to drop
into their Graves, without any consideration
whither they are going. And the Author
on the same account, was some time after
by the same Friends, (against his own Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
over-ruled and perswaded to permit
them to be Printed, (without his Name)
who gave him such Arguments for it, as he
could not resist, hoping that amongst so
much sincere natural Devotion, something
of great use may be found to enrich the
Souls of those, who are of no more capacity
then himself, who knew no true felicity, until
he learnt to meditate on his Eternity, which
every man has some Talents to practice on.</p>

they seek on Earth, because
the Wealth and Honours that
we gain, and all our joys in
them, are with our selves still perishing in
the height of our Fruitions; and in a
little time must all return unto the dust we
came from: Yet nothing does disturb the
heart of man so often, and so much, as
pampering of it with hopes of what we
seldom reach, and always over-valuing
what we aim at, which our Fancies like
Magnifying Glasses represent unto us,
with such multiplied Felicities, as dazle
our understanding, and captivate our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with an expectation of what we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

when his repeated sorrows for past sins do
create new joys for those sorrows; and
every new victory over a new temptation

conquests over Satan and himself.
So that if we can set our whole hearts sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
to delight in God, and his service,
<hi>We may have so many tasts of his Heavenly
joys here, and such frequent glimpses of that
glory,</hi> that we cannot hide our comforts in
the Holy Ghost from our own hearts while
we live, and when we die, our Souls will
rejoyce to fly into Christs arms, for the
consummation of all our hopes, all our
joys unto Eternity. And whoever doth
observe, will find that the deepest sorrows
for sin, does raise the highest joys for our
reconciliation, and will prove our fullest

We are also to consider, that the Gospel
does not invite us to forsake the pleasures
of this World, to go into a Dungeon,
(which were a hard lesson) but to remove
from hence to inhabit Heaven, with all
its glory to Eternity; yet this natural
cowardly disease of fearing to die, being
born with us, is without cure, <hi>until the

like of! or can so tire him with our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate

him. But when we find our hearts full of
such sincere raptures in Devotion, we

he can mock God, or flatter Him; while

to serve God, and the Devil at once; to
satisfie vitious natural appetites, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

to an assurance of his Sonship, by his
Spiritual comforts from the Holy Ghost
within him, and such transports as do
afford Heavenly joys, with some glimps
of that Glory, which he shall participate
of at the Resurrection; He will perceive
it is the same gift of God, beyond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

is to lead a pious Life, which will
fully satisfie all his ambitions, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the highest affections his heart can
fancy, by having God so, by whom he
has all that is in Heaven, and in Earth.
And whoever God does thus give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

to incourage and inable him to live
Righteously all his days in more honour,

do still set our hearts on these moments,

Thus to fear petty troubles here, and not
be at all concerned for endless Torments!

that we carry Immortal Souls within us,

we may with humble hearts say as <hi>Iacob</hi>

in our hearts too, when we are led by his

consider, that though all our senses are
naturally inclined to like, and covet va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
of all sorts, and that our busie
fancies are as readily subservient to work
the same way, and as eagerly do pursue
the various desires of every appetite,
though we every day find that all objects
do by fruition soon decay, and cloy our
highest desires that are not Rooted in
Eternity. How fit is it then to consider
this? and how much better it will be to
perswade our Immortal Souls to rob our
perishing senses of their depending fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and imploy them on things above,
as far as they can reach towards the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

so full, but still to admit of more and
more felicity as our desires rise, until
we reach the Fountain of Eternal Bliss,
where our Souls will be replenished with
Celestial joys, but never so to overflow
as to be weary of them. And thus we
may be as happy, as <hi>Iacob was, if we can
perswade our hearts to throw out Satan,
with all his disguised flattering Troops, and
entertain the Holy Ghost as chearfully as
we have indulged our blind affections,</hi> that
led us on towards our Eternal ruine:

               <p>THough <hi>David</hi> did commit some
great faults, he was a man after
God's own heart after that, and one of
the best patterns in Holy Writ, fit for us
to imitate; for his love, and gratitude to
God, who by custom grew to such a
pious friendship with his great Maker,
<hi>that much of his life was spent with God
alone in his retirements, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
all his affairs, made all his complaints
to, and humbly begged whatever his needs
were, with such a familiar trust in God, as
his only support, and only delight:</hi> So that
if we now consider <hi>David</hi>'s great affairs,
as a King, full of troubles, ever in Wars,
though glorious by his Atchievements,
yet in frequent dangers, vexed by a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
People hard to govern, besides the
disorders of his own Family; <hi>so that we
may think he omitted no opportunity to be
with God;</hi> that hath left so many Psalms
full of such high Divine Raptures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
to manifest his great piety; that it
is a wonder he could get so much time
for so many prayers, praises, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations.
By which we may learn, that in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36884:56"/>
what calling so ever God has set us, and
what troubles so ever He appoints for us,
<hi>we may find time to converse with God by
day, and night.</hi> So that if we repent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
and forsake our sins, with hearts as
servent towards God, as <hi>David</hi> did, no
doubt we shall be as well received,
though neither Kings, nor Prophets. We
may also call to mind, that <hi>David,</hi> as the
least considerable person of his Family,
had the lowest imployment, to keep his
Fathers Sheep; <hi>yet his heart was then set
high on God, or he might have been devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by that Lion, or that Bear he slew, if
God had not been with him. And we may
also think, that he was better acquainted
with God at his Flock, then</hi> Saul <hi>was on
his Throne;</hi> else he had not escaped <hi>Saul</hi>'s
surious malice, and so soon ascended that
Throne. <hi>By which we may see, that the
greatest King, and meanest man, may learn
of</hi> David, <hi>to love, serve, honour, worship,
and trust in God, with such a delight, as
will grow to a friendship with his Creator,
and raise his Soul up unto Heaven, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
his imployment on Earth is;</hi> and
those hours, and years of our life, which
we trifle away, as a burthen to be rid of,
not knowing how to spend idly enough,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36884:56"/>
we may imploy as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>and never
be alone, when most alone.</hi> Thus we may
enjoy a happy, and blessed security on
Earth; and have a true courage above
all such accidents as make ill men trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>And thus a pio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

his Soul of Eternal Bliss in Heaven; and
when Satan finds us always in such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
he will have small hopes to get an
Audience for his Addresses to destroy us.</hi>
So that if we can live thus like <hi>David,</hi>
we may hope to die in God's favour like
him; and as chearfully resign our Souls
into God's hands, who loves us more
then we can love him; and though we
cannot reach <hi>David</hi>'s highest perfections,
as an inspired Prophet, we may like him,
give continual thanks to God for all we
have, and sing praise, honour, and glory

Divine Existence from whence all things
are, and by which all things subsist, and
we among the rest are what we are:
From these natural reasonings, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we enquire into Traditions, and by
searching the Holy Scriptures, we are
powerfully taught concerning God,
Christ, and Holy Ghost, and there also
learn to improve our Faith; to believe

we die, participate of that glorious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

must believe, and expect that our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls will have much greater
transporting Joys in Heaven, then our
flesh is capable of, until refined for the

living, we can raise our Faith to trust in

our Salvation when we die; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

look more kindly on Death, who only
can conduct us to this everlasting Joy we

               <p>A Divine Author says, That every
man ought to be of some calling,
that he may be of some use unto the
State where God has made his station;
for he that will be good for nothing in
this World, is as nothing, and shall be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:36884:103"/>
nothing in the next; he is but as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
on Earth, none of Gods useful
Creatures; so that to be of a lawful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and diligent in it, may expect a
blessing from Heaven on his honest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
And Princes whose calling is
of a general concern, are set on Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids,
that all the World may see and
imitate their Virtues; Judges must be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
in doing Justice; great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at Sea and Land, must be prudently,
not rashly valiant; the Workman must
work; the Courtier must wait; the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
must travel; the Preacher must
teach; and the greatest Reprobate (if
he becomes Regenerate!) has a great
calling also; for he ought to declare his
conversion, by his future life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
that his Devotion may be more
eminent then his Crimes were; so to
manifest Gods mercy to himself, and by
his example to shew others the way to
Heaven: <hi>So that no man should hide his
Talent,</hi> that can by any honest means
improve it for the good of others. The
Hypocrite is the only unhappy man this
way, who will himself perish, though he
do good by encouraging others to Piety
by his example, who cannot discern the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36884:103"/>
Hypocrites counterfeit zeal, that travels
through the Church of God, as his nearest
way to Hell.</p>

He soon became a man after Gods

strength, company, power, joy, wealth,

whom he spent the most of his time after,
in Prayers and in Praises. So that as He

               <p>NO man can guess at the felicity of
holyMeditations but those who
constantly converse with God that way;
and who have obtained grace to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
at all times to such near apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches,
that their souls seem to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
amongst the Angels in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
while those Divine Addresses last;
by which God also seems to manifest his
Mercy unto the souls of men, in shewing
them some glimps of that Eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they shall share in at the Resurrection;
to fill our hearts with blessed Ideas of his
Celestial Joyes.</p>

               <p>HE that would know true joy on
Earth must secure his Eternal
Bliss unto his own heart; not only by
confessing, bewailing, and forsaking his
known sins in hope of pardon; but must
express his Love to God, and his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for that pardon; with a true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of it, by improving his peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
thereon with a Continual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in Heaven for the future; and
thereby raising his soul to such a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:36884:112"/>
Love of God, as to find that the prime
entertainment of his heart, is to be so
retired with his Creator, and Redeemer,
that he may observe how the Holy-Ghost
is ever present with them to improve
his delight in them, unto as high joy as
man is capable off on this side of Heaven:
And whoever can obtain grace, thus to
make his Devotion his prime pleasure
on Earth, will perceive a new kind of
felicity, by such an exaltation in his soul
as will raise his affection to God above
all other Divisions. And then, if such
Meditations do shew him such a prospect
of his Eternal Bliss, as doth create a
Faithful expectation of Heaven so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
here; He may presume that
he shall not want Divine Valour to die
cheerfully, when he is called to take
possession of that glorious purchase
which Christ had made for him there.</p>

               <p>IT is worthy of observation, and our
most serious Meditations, to see how
much all men of all humors, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
Young and Old, are generally
of one mind in our great Journey through
this world; Where we are humbled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:36884:112"/>
and tossed, and tumbled in
rough rugged ways up and down steep
Hills, full of hopes and fears, still enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with more storms than shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine,
and never free from such dangers,
as do fill most mens hearts with unquiet
thoughts through their own Journey;
though some good men well Armed,
can smile, and sleep it out with patience,
while others sighing, groan and weep
the whole way through: And too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there be in this great <hi>Caravan,</hi> who
Laugh and sing, and merrily pass their
whole time without a thought of whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are going, until their turn
comes to be tumbled out into the Pit,
with as little regard as they went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But almost all, are all the way
of the same mind, to Linger on in their
uneasie passage, rather than once hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to wish to see their Journeys end;
and very few there are, that do enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any joyful thoughts of their arrival
there at Last; So that till Time by Day
and Night, of course transports them
thither; though tied and Cripled by
various hardships in their long travels,
very many do wish they might return
the rugged way they came; to endure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:36884:113"/>
age of sorrows, pains, and
troubles, rather than to alight from
their Woren-out Waggons, to rest a
while in their own Homes, though they
know there is no other way to pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Eternal Bliss. But when they find
the wheels, and Axel-trees that bore
them up, do crack under their heavy
burdens, past all hope to carry them any
Longer on; then to late, they flatter
themselves with vain hopes to flatter
God, as if they did desire to be with Him;
When they do know that God doth
see, that nothing could by them be
done, to keep them longer from Him.
For which great frailty in Mankind,
the only sure cure is, to think of, and
prepare for our journeys End, all the
way we travel thither; And then the
expectation of that joy, and that Glory
we march towards, will sweeten all we
suffer on our way to God. And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are those men, that can obtain grace
to travel so to Heaven, as to get such a
tast of those Celestial joys in their way
thither, as will make their hearts glad
to think they shall Arrive, where they
are to Rest for ever in peace, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

How great an offence is it! for
Christians to oppress their Neighbors, by

evil actions, or to defame, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the most Innocent on any design,
or for envy; and in general to be more

               <p>HE who truly loves, desires to be
much with his beloved; and if
God be that object of his hearts delight;
he will desire to be ever with him, and
may assuredly have what he so desires,

God will sometimes admit of his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
