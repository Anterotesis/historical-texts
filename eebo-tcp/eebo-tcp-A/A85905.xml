            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>WHereas we the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholikes of this Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> have been continuall loving and faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to His ſacred Majeſty; And notwithſtanding the generall and hard oppreſſions ſuffered by ſubordinate
Governours, to the ruine of our lives, honours, and eſtates. Yet having ſome liberty of Religion from His
Majeſty out of the Effluence of His Princely love unto us; We weighing no corporall loſſe in reſpect of
that great Immunity of the ſoul, are inviolably reſolved to infix our ſelves in an immutable and pure allegeance, for ever to
His ſaid Royall Majeſtie and Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>Now ſo it is, That the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> maligning, and envying any Graces received from His Majeſty by our
Nation, and knowing none ſo deſired by us, as that of Religion; And likewiſe perceiving His Majeſty to be inclining,
to give us the liberty of the ſame, drew His Majeſties Prerogative out of His hands; Thereby largely pretending the generall
good of His Majeſties Kingdoms. But we the ſaid Catholikes and loyall Subjects to His Majeſty, do probably finde as well
by ſome Acts to paſſe, by them the ſaid Parliament, touching our Religion, in which the Catholikes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did ſuffer; As alſo by threat, to ſend over the Scottiſh Army with the Sword, and Bible in hand againſt us, That this
whole and ſtudied plot was, and is, not only to extinguiſh Religion (by which we altogether live happy;) But likewiſe
to ſupplant us, and raze the name of Catholike and Iriſh, out of the whole Kingdom. And ſeeing this ſurpriſe ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
tending abſolutely to the overthrow of the liberty of our Conſciences and Country, And alſo our Gracious Kings
Power forced from him, in which, and in whoſe prudent care over us, our ſole quiet and comfort conſiſted; and without
the which, the fear of our preſent ruines did preſcrible opinion, and premoniſh us to ſave our ſelves. We therefore as well
to regain His Excellent Majeſties ſaid Prerogative, being only due to him and His Succeſſors; and being the Eſſence and life
of Monarchy, hoping thereby to confirm a ſtrong and invincible Unity between His Royall and ever happy love unto us,
and our faithfull duty, and loyalty to His incomparable Majeſty; Have taken Arms and poſſeſſed our ſelves of the beſt and
ſtrongeſt Forts of this Kingdom, to enable us to ſerve His Majeſty, and defend us from the Tyrannous reſolution of our
enemies; Thus our Conſciences, as we wiſh the peace of the ſame to our ſelves, and our poſterity, is the pretence and true
cauſe of our preſent riſing in Arms, By which we are reſolved to perfect the Advancement of the Truth, and the ſafety
of our King and Country. Thus much we thought fitting in generall, to publiſh unto the world, to ſet forth our innocent
and juſt cauſe, the particular whereof ſhall be ſpeedily declared.</p>
