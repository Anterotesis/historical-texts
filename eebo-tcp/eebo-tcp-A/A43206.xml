            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </q>
those many animosities and irreconciled Feuds, besides the depravity of the late age, leave such a dreadful prejudice upon this attempt, that like the atcheivement of the <hi>Augaean labour,</hi> nothing but Rivers of Oyl can asswage or mitigate and purge the distemper.</p>
                  <p>And that course I may presume to have steered, saving in that <hi>parricidial</hi> Fact, the abhorrence of the world, an impiety of such a magnitude, that it cannot be heightned by any aggravation, no more than lessened by any excuse, as Sir <hi>Heneage Finch</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently observed; indeed, such an unmeasurable wickedness, save that it filled up the measure of its iniquity, as <hi>infinity</hi> of time can never parallel, unless such unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled and unfortunate Vertue and Innocence dare appear again: and therefore to clear and free the Nation, and expiate the infamy of that treason, the individual persons of that Conspiracy are marked and branded with their Character.</p>
                  <p>As to other persons, I have used the severest cautions I could, that I trespassed not upon their name, by any wrong, sinister, single, or injurious report; nor willingly at all, but where such account was of great evidence, light, and satisfaction to the subject discoursed of. I must confess, as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> said, <hi>Truth may be followed too neer,</hi> both to persons, time, and place; like <hi>Diana,</hi> she must not be seen naked, and prophaned by a full view; and many are yet living, who are very unwilling to hear their story: I have therefore piously abstained (without most just and notorious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) from thrusting my Pen wilfully into such matter, to the wounding of any mans Reputation, considering what the same Satyrist wisely adventured,

                  <p>As to Actions, I have not indiligently traced and examined all relations of them; but such is the variety thereof, that I flatter not my self with the hopes of giving ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb facs="tcp:53069:320"/>
satisfaction: nor would my designe allow me to be copious or particular in every mans merit; if I should have discharged that <hi>Debt</hi> of Glory, I should have undone the <hi>Credit</hi> of this modest and plain-meaning History. I have used for my better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection herein, whatsoever Authentick accounts I could procure; and particularly I am obliged to the Honourable Sir <hi>Lewis Dyve,</hi> for his exact and elegant Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Irish War in <hi>1649,</hi> under the conduct of the most noble the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>; as also to several other Noble hands for divers small Pieces relating to this Work, on whose difficult and perplexed Contexture I could otherwise neither safely nor fairly have adventured.</p>
                  <p>That is part of my defence for this undertaking: for I suppose the honour of such Personages placed beyond the reach of Calumny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as to the rest, which shews its Birth and Production by a distinct and discernible stile, I can justly alledge the most known and approved Authorities; and for the publication of it in this manner, and at this time, the fortune of a former Impression, and importunity for this, as the first Essay of this kinde in English, that can lay claim to the prosperous veracity of the times.</p>
                  <p>The great wonder of our Revolutions is not yet over, and the Vnderlings of the last Age, who were born during the Rebellion, as yet in a Maze, and astonisht at the Event and Issue of our Troubles; nor can be settled in that Allegiance which was a stranger to their Nativity. That therefore such, and future Posterity, might be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the state and nature of the Quarrel, and be more satisfied with their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary obedience (to be improved now by this seasonable account of the dispute thereof through the last twenty years) I have endeavoured a perfect Relation in this <hi>Series</hi> of the War, and succeeding Affairs.</p>
                  <p>And I will here onely mention, for the advice of future times, and as a necessary <hi>Memento</hi> to the present, what evils and mischiefs (even to the brink of destruction) the popular Cheats of Religion and Liberty have most terribly effected. I will not instance the successful Artifices of the Vsurpers, which wanted not any the smallest plausible ingredients, till their Conspiracy came to a powerful consistency, and was able to vindicate and intitle its Treason to the authority of the Law. If this could have been foreseen or prevented, there had scarce been twenty guilty persons in the Nation, whereas a considerable number are now obnoxious to the Government, upon the score of those prevailing and thriving Grandees, who offered the World to their Adherers, and gave them the unjust possession of their impious Conquest.</p>
                  <p>The whole Work is divided into four parts, as well for the more distinct and clear perceivance of each form and shape of the Anarchy, its interests and peculiar relative Affairs, as for a rest and pause to the Reader, who would otherwise be wearied with a hudled continuance of such Confusions. I will adde no more: for I think it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to engage further in the matter, or anticipate the Contents of this Chronicle (which name it onely pretends to, as a Iournal or Day-book of Time) but having once more requested the most favourable acceptance and censure thereof, and that the Reader will please to measure the Failures and Errours of it by its abstruse, obscure, and intricate Conveyances, which admitted of no certain, full, and infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (as agreed on by all hands) the particulars claiming to the grand success and sum of every Action for their belief, to bid him happily</p>

                  <p>HAving promised a short Abstract of those vast sums of Money the Long Parliament and their continued Usurpation drained out of the Purses and Blood, I may say, of the <hi>English</hi> people; I found in the Progress of the Account, that it would exceed all Arithmetick, and belief to the Reputation and Credit of History: yet because I would not totally disappoint Posterity, I will give them the <hi>Items,</hi> and let their leisure and compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation reckon the Sums, if they can find numbers for it; but I fear I shall not count half of them.</p>

                  <p>The Fees of the two Speakers (and their Clerks) of the Lords and Commons House of Parliament, for Pardons of Delinquents, is 35 <hi>l.</hi> for every man whose Estate is 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and upward.</p>
                  <p>Ten thousand men so compounding and paying, amounts to 2000000; and is Twenty hundred thousand pounds; being 200 Waggons loading of silver, every Waggon loading being 10000 <hi>l.</hi> of silver.</p>
                  <p>Divide 10000 men in ten parts; as thus:</p>
                  <p>One thousand men, Delinquents, whose Estates are betwixt one and 200 <hi>l.</hi> a year, every man paying but 200 <hi>l.</hi> two years Revenue, amounted to 200000 <hi>l.</hi> a year.</p>
                  <p>The second thousand men, whose Estates are betwixt two and 300 <hi>l.</hi> a year, paying two years Revenue, comes to 400000 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <p>The third thousand of Compounders, whose Estates are betwixt three and 400 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and so paying, amounts to 600000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth thousand Compounders, whose Estates are betwixt four and 500 <hi>l.</hi> a year, pays 800000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth thousand Compounders, whose Estates are betwixt five and 600 <hi>l.</hi> a year, pays 1000000 <hi>l.</hi> which is 300 Waggons loading of silver, every Waggon loading being 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in silver.</p>
                  <p>The other five thousand Delinquents paying as the beforementioned five thousand Compounders, amounts to 8000000 <hi>l.</hi> that is, 800 Waggons of silver, 10000 <hi>l.</hi> being a Waggons loading.</p>
                  <p>All which is a Mass of Money, yet but a small sum to the moneys brought in as followeth.</p>

                  <head>A CHRONICLE OF THE CIVIL WARS OF ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND. THE FIRST PART: BEING The Commons War.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O higher or greater cause can be assigned for this War (setting aside the sins of all Times and Nations, to which the Justice of Heaven is seldome long a Debtor) but the fate and catastrophe of Kingdoms and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, which do at certain periods of time taste of that vicissitude and mutability, to which all other sublunary things are more frequently subjected.</p>
                  <p>The secondary causes of it, are so many and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, so variously reported and believed, that it would spend much of the paper allotted to this History in ascertaining them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to contain and keep within the limits of this designment; something onely shall be said of them, that was obvious to every eye, not savouring of partiality or affection.</p>
                  <p>Many disorders and Irregularities no doubt there were in the State, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through a long and lazy peace, bolstred up with an Universal trade, which procured a general wealth, the Parents of Wantonnesses; the excess of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal riches being but as the burden which the Ass carries, and mistakes for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender; people being onely the better able to sustain their future misery, with their present plenty.</p>
                  <p>These conceived abuses in the manage of the State (like ill humours, where they finde an equal resistance, or over-power of nature,) sunk and descended upon the Ecclesiastical Regiment, too impotent to sustain those general assaults which were given it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53069:5"/>No storms or tempests can be raised or maintained below, without the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial influences, or disturbances in the upper Region; nor often are there any Commotions or Wars among or in Nations, where Religion, which ought to be the peaceablest and most innocent perswasion, is not the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> the great mover of the Machine of Destruction.</p>

                  <p>Nothing from abroad could any way break off that continued series of peace we had so long enjoyed; we had made the Nations round about us to wonder at, and to dread the putting forth of that strength which had been matured and ripened by the sunshine of so great a prosperity, so many years together, while the world about us was hurled into the confusions of Ruine and War, ready to become a prey to the next potent Invasion.</p>

                     </note>Strange moreover it is, That the miserable Distractions and Confusions which ensued, should be derived from no greater beginnings then a few Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Church; that War, which stands upon none, should be founded and fixt upon them: and yet nothing more certain can be charged with the guilt of so much misery as these Kingdoms so long suffered under; but the Cavils, Discontents and disputes about them.</p>
                  <p>A grudging there was for many years before, in the Raigns of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and King <hi>Iames,</hi> in whose days, and at his first assumption to this Crown, a Conference was before him managed by the Reformists about them,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Nor was there much noise about them in the beginning of the Raign of King <hi>Charles</hi>; but towards the middle it began to threaten a storm, in the year 1635. towards the conclusion whereof, some Uproars and Commotions were raised,<note place="margin">

                  <p>These men, though questionless from different grounds and respects (as this age hath lived to see by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who proved a great and happy instrument in the Kings Restitution, and consequently, the resettlement of the Church) printed several Books against the aforesaid Ceremonies; for these Books they were apprehended (which were charged also to be full of Invectives against the Bishops and Episcopal Government) and were severely censured in the Star-Chamber, to the exasperation of a great part of the Kingdom.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>This year also Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> formerly Lord Keeper, relapsed again into the Kings disfavour, for some disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

                        </note>The true Original of these Tumults, was a <hi>Revocation</hi> made by King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, of such things as had passed away in prejudice of the Crown, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by some of the late Princes in their minorites; by this course some of the principal Contrivers of this Covenant, found their Estates within the danger of the Laws: And though the King, to rectifie that proceeding of his, had made appear his clemency, in waving all the advantages which the Laws afforded him, not one of his Subjects being damnified by the said Revocation; yet for all this, the principal persons laboured a disaffection to the Government, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the envy of procuring that Revocation upon the Prelates,<note place="margin">

Other things there were relating to the Ministers themselves, the Gentry, and their Farmers, who paid the Tythes to the Nobility; being the burthen of Impropriations: This the King thought to remedy by granting out a Commission to a great number of the prime of all estates and degrees, to relieve, if they should see cause, both the Ministers and others who suffered by that grievance: This Commission was called,<note place="margin">

The Bishop of <hi>Edinburg,</hi> who was to Preach, stept into the Pulpit, which is immediately above the place where the Dean was to read; intending to appease the Tumult, by putting them in minde of the sacredness of the place, and of the horrible prophanation thereof: But then the rabble grew so enraged and mad, that if a stool aimed to be thrown at him, had not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially diverted by the hand of one present, the life of that Prelate had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, if not lost. The Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Lord Chancellor, with divers others, offering to appease the multitude, were entertained with such bitter curses and imprecations, that not being able to prevail with the people, the Provost, Bailiffs, and divers others of the Council of the City, were forced to come down from the Gallery on which they usually sit, and with much ado, in a very great Tumult and confusion thrust out these disorderly people, making fast the Church-doors. After all which, the Dean proceeded to read Service, which was devoutly performed, being assisted by the Lords and the Bishops then present: Yet the clamor, rapping at Church-doors, and throwing of stones in at the Church-windows by the rabble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out was so great, that the Magistrates were constrained to go out and use their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for to appease the multitude. After a little pause and cessation, the Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Preached; and after Sermon done, in his going from Church, was so invironed with a multitude of the meaner sort of people cursing and crowding him, that he was near being trod to death, if he had not recovered the stayrs of his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where he was again assaulted, and was like to have been pulled backwards, if the Earl of <hi>Weems</hi> from his next Lodging, seeing the Bishops life in danger, had not sent his servants to rescue him; who got the Bishop almost breathless into his Chamber. In other Churches the Minister was forced to give over reading: And so that Morning passed.</p>

                     <p>Thus the Reformation began there with such terrible profanations of the Lords day, and of the Lords House; an ill omen, what in future would be the conclusion; and this done by the same many-headed Monster, that in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner began the troubles in <hi>England</hi>; nor ever was the Union more perfect and streight, then in such mischiefs.</p>

                        </note> where I may not omit one fatal passage. On the 19th day of <hi>November,</hi> being the Anniversary of his Majesties Birth, part of the Walls of the strong Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> fell down; which was likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted for an ill Omen: such another, though more unhappily, and nearly significant,<note place="margin">

                        </note> was that of the fall of the head of his staff at his Tryal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pretended High Court of Justice. For the repairing of these ruines, the King sent the Lord <hi>Estrich,</hi> Col. <hi>Ruthen</hi> and others, who were resisted by the Covenanters, as men not qualified for the service.</p>
                     <p>No hopes for these and other reasons being conceivable of treating, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the <hi>Scots</hi> to obedience, a Resolution was taken vigorously to prosecute the War commenced the year before; to which purpose it was debated at a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet-Council, where none were present but the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and <hi>Hamilton</hi>; and there agreed that a Parliament must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and that in the mean time, for the speedy raising of money, the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy should subscribe what sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they would advance to this service for the present occasion, till the King could be otherwise helped by Subsidies.<note place="margin">

                        </note> To this purpose the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> first subscribed twenty thousand pounds, the like did the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and the Nobility according to the several values of their Estates. The Clergy granted four shillings in the pound in their Convocation, which presently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, to be paid for six years together; only the City of <hi>London</hi> were refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and could not be induced to lend one farthing to the carrying on of that War.</p>
                     <p>By these Loans (however) of the Kings Loyally affected Subjects, he was again in a formidable posture; and the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> besides his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal disbursments,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The Scots now interposed themselves betwixt the King and Parliament, though siding clearly with the Parliament, having by Treaty agreed with them to send over 2500 men into the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the English pay. Through their thus taking of their parts, the Parliament flew high now in their demands, requiring the disposal of the Command of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the management of the Militia; which being refused, they desisted not, but on the 26 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> Petitioned the King for them both; to which the King by several reasons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in the nagative.

They protested all along, that if his Majesty should persist in the denyal of the Militia, the Dangers were such as would indure no longer delay, but that they should be forced to dispose of it by Authority of Parliament, and must resolve so to do, as it was by them propounded: Desiring, that for the safety of his person and people, in much jealousie and Fear, he will be pleased to reside in or neer <hi>London,</hi> and to continue the Prince at St. <hi>Iames's,</hi> or any other Houses neer <hi>London,</hi> to prevent the Jealousies and Fears of the people.

In the whole Army, were very many expert and valiant Commanders: all the distrust was in the Welch Infantry, who at first beginning were somwhat skittish.

                           </p>
                        </note> the Royalists knew that <hi>Essex</hi> had received an addition as aforesaid under <hi>Hambden,</hi> and so were stronger in Foot; the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sexians</hi> likewise knew that Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Horse, which were the best, were as good as fresh and untouched, and they had tasted of their Gallantry. In this consultation they stood till night, when the King retreated to the place from whence he descended, the side of <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> where with the Prince in his Coach he passed that night, his Army keeping great Fires; and in the morning march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Foot away, while the Horse stood in Battalia towards <hi>Ayno.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> lodged that night on the place where the fight was, and then (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear and discouragement) marched to <hi>Warwick,</hi> leaving the King to pursue his way for <hi>London,</hi> which was the thing by this fight he attempted to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>The Victory is questioned by either part: the King was denyed it, because he left the field, and the dead to the disposal of the enemy, and marched away. That was answered, that it was agreeable to the Kings designe, which was no more than to make his way free for <hi>London</hi> aforesaid; and expedition was requisite. It is denyed also to the Parliament, for that they lost somewhat more men, and more Standards, and received a confess'd defeat in one part of the Army: But the main was, that they durst not offer to set upon or impede the King in his March the next morning, but go away far enough from him to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and thereby lost <hi>Banbury</hi> (wherein was a well-appointed Garrison) to the King; which was a remarkable Trophee of his Conquest.</p>
                     <p>However, both parties gave God solemn thanks (on days set apart) for their success and victory; the Parliament adding other to their General for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and good conduct in that business, and presented him with 5000 <hi>l.</hi> for a reward of his service.</p>
                     <p>On both sides were slayn here neer 6000 men, as by the Country it was judged, who had the burial of the dead. On the Kings party were slayn of note, the right Noble and valiant the Lord <hi>Aubigney,</hi> who died of his wounds at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> and was buried in Christ-Church <hi>Oxford,</hi> (Father to the most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi>); the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmond Varney,</hi> as before, and Colonel <hi>Monro</hi> a Scotch-man. On the Parliaments side, the Lord <hi>St. Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bletso,</hi> who dyed also of his wounds; Colonel <hi>Essex,</hi> and Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Ramsey</hi>; all men of singular courage and resolution.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> next day marched towards <hi>Coventry,</hi> and the King by <hi>Ayno,</hi> (where his Army refreshed themselves) to <hi>Banbury,</hi> which was presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him; and so to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King marching from <hi>Oxford,</hi> was by the way to <hi>London</hi> met by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners from the Parliament, tendring Propositions, and desiring that during the Treaty the Kings Army should march no neerer this way; to spin time, while <hi>Essex</hi> could recruit his Army: Wherefore the King advancing from <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> came to <hi>Brainford,</hi> where part of the Parliaments Army, (being the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Colonel <hi>Hollis, Hambden,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brooks</hi>) for a while main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their ground stoutly; but being over-powred, some were driven into the River, and there drowned, and three hundred slayn, among whom was Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonel <hi>Quarles,</hi> and as many taken prisoners. This brought a general consternation upon the City of <hi>London</hi>; all shops were shut up, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, both Trained Bands and Auxiliaries, were drawn out: So that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had a most compleat and numerous Army of a sudden. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King presently marched away, fearing to be encompassed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians, over <hi>Kingston</hi>-bridge (which he broke down, to stop the pursuit

                     </p>
                     <p>It seems it was first resolved by the Council of State, that <hi>Essex</hi> his Forces should not quit <hi>Newbery,</hi> or draw out into the Field, lest the King should take it for Winter-quarters; but when the King should retreat from the relief of <hi>Dennington,</hi> to fall upon his Rear: But no such matter was prosecuted; for the King possest himself of that Town, as a good covert and quarter for his Army, while the Parliaments Forces lay in the open Fields, who being by the Kings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to them at <hi>Hungerford,</hi> and one thousand Horse sent under the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Gage</hi> from thence, hastily dislodged also from the Siege of <hi>Basing,</hi> (where <hi>Manchester</hi> and his whole Army had shewed themselves onely) departed to their Winter-quarters in <hi>Reading, Henly, Abington,</hi> and <hi>Farnham</hi>; and the King's to <hi>Basing, Odiam, Newbery, Blewbury</hi> and <hi>Marlborough.</hi>

                     <p>To this end they began with a subtle Order,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>They Order that no Member shall bear command in either Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or Civil affairs.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Forty days were limited from this Order, by which all such Commissions and Commands were in the Army declared void; with a resolution nevertheless expressed, to pay off their Arrears; which was meanly performed, and at the same rate that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had the Ten thousand pounds a year assigned him (for the good service he had done the State) out of the Lands of the Lord <hi>Capel</hi> (whose Heirs now have his Honour) and other Delinquents, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually paid him.</p>

                     <p>While this Army was a modelling, many disorders happened, which retarded their settlement: it was to consist of fourteen thousand Foot, and seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse and Dragoons effective; so that the Spring was well advanced, before they were in any readiness.<note place="margin">

For the Militia, he would consent some Forts and Garrisons should remain in the Parliaments hands <hi>pro tempore,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The King refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to alter Religion by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but would admit of some amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Liturgie.</hi>
                        </note> for security of the agreement; the King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nomination of half the Commissioners. For <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King would not abrogate the Cessation, until he were sure the Rebellion here were at an end; having, to avoid that popular demand, and to prevent any insisting upon that point, given Order to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> to conclude a Peace, but however to continue the Cessation for a year; for which he should promise the Irish,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>He is willing some Garrisons should be in the Parliaments hands</hi> pro tempore, <hi>but will not abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> if he could have it no cheaper, to joyn with them against the Scots and <hi>Inchiqueen:</hi> for by that time, the King said he hoped his condition would be such, <hi>as the Irish should be glad to accept of less, or he enabled to grant more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Parliament on the contrary side, insisted, as to Religion, upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the Kings Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, his Donations and Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Bishopricks, his First-fruits and Tenths of Bishops, Deans, Deans and Chapters; not offering to constitute the least dependance of the Clergy upon the King, to the Presbyterian mode; compensating him with Bishops Lands, in lieu of all those; which of themselves, if dissov'd, belong unto the Crown. For <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King should annul the Cessation, and leave the management of that Kingdome to the Scots. And for the Militia, that it should be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged altogether by such Commissioners as they should appoint; so that the King should not have the least power of his own to assist his Neighbours and Allies, or defend himself at home.</p>
                     <p>They had also so obstructed any hopes of a conclusion, by limiting the time of the Treaty to twenty days, and trying up the Commissioners with such limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that the good effect thereof was despaired at the entrance into it. Much perswasion was used by the Kings side, to the Parliaments Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that they would gain longer time, and that the Treaty might be revived; but all to no purpose. And to this matter, notable is that of one Mr. <hi>Love,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Love <hi>a strange Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary.</hi>
                        </note> who by some private means or other was admitted to Preach before the said Commissioners there; where he said, <hi>It was as possible for Heaven and Hell, as the King and Parliament to agree</hi>; strange words to be uttered in such a juncture, and in such a place, and before such an Assembly! but the end of that man shewed him the folly and wickedness of that expression. So after two and twenty dayes Conference, the Treaty ended in vain.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Treaty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in vain.</hi>
                        </note> The Kings Commissioners complained of this <hi>Love</hi>; but answer was made, he was none of their train, but the Parliament should be informed of him, who would do justice upon him; but the business was husht.</p>

                        </note> and one Colonel <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> who were, as was said before, seized in <hi>Dublin</hi> the night of the breaking forth of the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had been Prisoners in the <hi>Tower</hi> ever since, and some while before broke out from thence, and wading over the Moat escaped away, being found in <hi>Drury-Lane London,</hi> at a private house, were brought to the Kings-Bench-Bar, (though <hi>Macguire</hi> pleaded his Priviledge of Peerage, and insisted peremptorily on it, while over-ruled by the Court and Parliament together) and there after a Tryal, both sentenced for their Treason, to be hang'd, drawn and quartered; which they underwent with a great deal of stoutness, and their way of Piety; clearing the King from any privity to that Rebellion.</p>

                     <p>Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> an eminent man for the King in the North, was sent from <hi>Oxford</hi> to relieve <hi>Ponfract</hi>-Castle in <hi>York-shire,</hi> Besieged by the Forces of the Lord <hi>Fairfax:</hi> This Expedition he so prudently and valiantly underwent, that in his way thither he routed Colonel <hi>Rossiter,</hi> who opposed him at <hi>Melton-Mowbray,</hi> and passed forward; and with resolution, though twice inferiour in number, so charged the Besiegers, that after a sharp conflict he beat them from the Siege, and having relieved the Castle, departed back again to the assistance of the King, then threatned with a fresh and potent Army from <hi>London.</hi>

Their General himself having lost the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Blessing the Kingdom with a Peace when it lay in his power, to which he was courted by the King a while before at <hi>Lestithiel,</hi> seeing how the Pulse of the times beat, and what Counsels were likely to prevail, withdrew himself in a Discontent to <hi>Eltham</hi>-House in <hi>Kent,</hi> where not long after he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, as in due time shall be declared.</p>
                     <p>At that same time that <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was thus surprised, the Kings Forces had a Success,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>A notable suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess at the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises, <hi>under Sir</hi> Jacob Ashley.</note> for the handsomness, though not for the consequence of it, very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. The Kings Forces had Garrisoned a repayred Castle at the <hi>Devises,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Devereux</hi> had a Garrison at <hi>Roudon</hi>-House between <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and that; which therefore for its inconvenience was Besieged. Colonel <hi>Stephens</hi> of <hi>Glocester-shire</hi> came to its Relief with 200 Horse, and as many Foot from <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and forced his passage with provision into the House. While he stayed to take further order for the security of the place, the Royalists surround the House again, cast up a Work where he entred, and keep him in; and Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley</hi> comes to second the Siege with 3000 men. <hi>Massey</hi> understanding this, did what he could to draw off Sir <hi>Iacob,</hi> by facing <hi>Cyrencester,</hi> and sending a Party of Horse from <hi>Glocester,</hi> which were to joyn with a like number from <hi>Malmsbury</hi> again; but all in vain: the besieged were compelled at last to render themselves upon very hard terms and conditions.</p>
                     <p>About this time there was a kind of Faction in the Kings Court at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and some altercations betwixt the parties concerning the Kings Council;<note place="margin">

                     <p>After Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had summoned it, wherein he offered quarter to the Town, the Committee of that County then resident there, assembled all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and read the Summons unto them; by whom it was resolved to give answer next morning. The Trumphet was no sooner returned, but a Drum was presently dispatcht for a full answer within an hour; which while they debated beyond their stint, the Kings Guns played from the Battery, and all Souldiers were commanded to their respective Posts; the great and small Shot never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting that day and night; when next morning they Stormed at six or seven places.

                              </note>FOr the service of the Parliament, I have brought their Army before the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and do Summon you in their Names to render it, with all the Forts belonging to the same, into my hands for their use.</p>
                           <p>Having used this plain language, as the business requires, I wish it may be as effectual unto you, as it is satisfactory to my self, that I do a little expostulate with you about the Surrender of the same; which I confess is a way not common, and which I should not have used, but in respect to such a person, and such a place. I take into consideration your Royal Birth, and Relation to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
                              <pb n="85" facs="tcp:53069:47"/>
your Honour, Courage, the vertues of your person, and the strength of that place, which you may think your self bound and able to maintain.</p>
                           <p>Sir, the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is and will be where it ought to be; we fight to maintain it there; but the King misled by evil Counsellours, or through a seduced heart, hath left his Parliament, under God the best assurance of his Crown and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: the maintaining of this <hi>Schism,</hi> is the ground of this unha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>pie War on your part; and what sad effects it hath produced in the three Kingdoms, is visible to all men. To maintain the rights of the Crown and Kingdom joyntly, a principal part thereof is, that the King in <hi>Supream Acts</hi> is not to be advised by men of whom the Law takes no notice, but by his Parliament, the great Council of the Kingdom, in whom (<hi>as much as man is capable of</hi>) he hears all his people as it were at once advising him, and in which multitude of Counsellours lies his <hi>safety,</hi> and his peoples <hi>Interest:</hi> And to <hi>see him right</hi> in this, hath been the constant and faithful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Parliament; and to bring those wicked instruments to justice that have misled him, is the principal ground of our fighting.</p>
                           <p>Sir,<note place="margin">Observe the strange guise of these words.</note> 
                              <hi>if God makes this clear to you, as he hath to us,</hi> I doubt not but he will give you a heart to deliver this place, notwithstanding all the other considerations of Honour, Courage, Fidelity, <hi>&amp;c. Because of their constancy and use in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business, depends upon the right or wrongfulness of this that hath been said.</hi> And if upon <hi>such conviction</hi> you shall surrender it, and save the loss of blood, or hazard the spoiling of such a City, it would be an occasion glorious in it self, and joyful to us, for the restoring of you to the endeared affections of <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and People of</hi> England, <hi>the truest friend to your Family it hath in the World.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>But if this be hid from your eyes,</hi> and through your wilfulness, this so great, famous and ancient a City be by your putting us to force the same exposed to the ruine and extremities of War (<hi>which yet we shall in that case as much as possible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent</hi>) then I <hi>appeal</hi> to the <hi>righteous God,</hi> to be judge between you and us, and to require the wrong. And let all <hi>England</hi> judge whether the burning of its Towns, ruining its Cities, and destroying its people, be a good requital from a person of your Family, <hi>which hath the Prayers, Tears, Purses, and blood of its Parliament and People.</hi> And if you look on either as now divided, hath ever had that same party both in Parliaments and People, most zealous for their assistance and restitution, which you now oppose and seek to destroy, and whose constant grief hath been, that their desires to serve that your Family, have been ever hindred or made fruitless by that same party about his Majesty, whose Counsel you act, and whose Interest you pursue in this unnatural War.</p>

                     <p>In the mean while, additions of Country-forces, by means of Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> and others, promoting the Generals Warrant to that purpose, being come to the Leaguer, a Storm was concluded on, for that intelligence came to the Army, and was seconded with advice from the Committee of both Kingdoms, that the King, who was then newly come out of the Associated Counties, of which by and by, was intended for the relief of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and to that purpose was to joyn with General <hi>Goring,</hi> who was newly inforced, as was said before, and was now about <hi>Collumpton</hi> in <hi>Devonshire</hi>; whose Letters intercepted, being sent to Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> said, that within three Weeks time he should be in a condition to relieve the Town: So that the Prince did prudently tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize with <hi>Fairfax,</hi> by sending out a Draught of very high Articles, while suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour might be sent him, and his Lines finished; though others, and those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant expert Commanders, of whom for honours sake Colonel <hi>Pretty</hi> ought not to be forgotten, declared, that the Town was tenable by force, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the courtesie or charms or words to preserve it: but it since appears, that the Prince had Orders from the King, if it came to extremity, to surrender it upon honourable Articles.</p>
                     <p>On the 10 of <hi>September,</hi> the City having been alarmed two nights together, about two of the Clock in the morning the Storm began,<note place="margin">Bristol <hi>Storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Sept. 10.</note> which was round the City; (for the Sea-men also having (by the loss of <hi>Portshed,</hi> which was rendred to Colonel <hi>Weldens</hi> Regiment) free riding in the River, attempted it of their side; but the Tide failed them) the disposal of the several posts of the several Regiments was after this manner. The signal being given, which was by setting on fire a great heap of straw and faggots on the top of a hill, and the shooting of four great Pieces of Ordnance against <hi>Pryors</hi> Fort, from the place where the General was to reside all the time of the Storm, the General Assault began: Colonel <hi>Montague</hi> and Colonel <hi>Pickerings</hi> Brigade, with their Regiments, at <hi>Lawfords</hi> gate entred speedily, and recovered two and twenty great Guns, and took many Prisoners in the Works; them Major <hi>Desborough</hi> seconded with his Horse of the Generals Regiment, and part of Colonel <hi>Graves.</hi> Sir <hi>Hardress Waller's</hi> Regiment, and the Generals, between <hi>Lawfords</hi> gate and the River <hi>Froom.</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Pride</hi>'s Regiment part against <hi>Pryors</hi> Fort, and part to alarm the great Fort, who in the mean while took a Fort wherein were some Welch-men.

The Horse that entred here, were led on by Captain <hi>Ireton,</hi> seconded by Major <hi>Bethel,</hi> who received a shot in the thigh, whereof he after dyed: whose Troops likewise mortally wounded Colonel <hi>Taylor</hi> of the Kings party. The Line being thus thrown down by the Pioneers, and mastered both by the Foot and Horse, the Royalists Horse retreated, and stood in a Body under the favour of the great Fort, and <hi>Coulstons</hi> Fort. <hi>Priors</hi>-hill-Fort held out the most obstinately, but at length was resolutely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered, where <hi>Prides</hi> Souldiers gave no quarter except to a very few, in regard of the great slaughter they within made by their gallant defence.</p>

of the estate of the Royalists in the Town. This being accordingly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Dragoons were answered with a round Volley of Shot; thereupon their Forlorn Hope of Foot went and engaged themselves to bring off the Dragoons; and the Reserve fell on to bring off their Forlorn.

                     <p>That out of a desire to keep a right understanding between the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, <hi>he acquainted them with a strange providence with which his Army was surprized, together with their carriage and desires thereupon: That the King came the</hi> 4 <hi>of</hi> May, <hi>in so private a manner, that after they had made some search for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the surmises of persons who pretended to know his face, yet they could not find him out in sundry houses. Trusting to our integrity, we are so far perswaded that none will so far misconster us, as to make use of this seeming advantage, for promoting any other ends than are expressed in the Covenant — We do ingenuously declare, that there hath been no Treaty nor Capitulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Majesty and us, nor in our names; leaving the ways and means of Peace unto the Parliament of both Kingdomes.</hi> And with such twilight of language concluded.</p>
                     <p>This was the happiest oportunity that ever offered it self, to do honour to the Scotch Nation, who had the Peace of three Kingdomes, but their own particular glory, at their sole Arbitrement; and how miserably they abused this advantage, and how they debauched their duty to their Prince, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the World, we will not descant upon, since the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the year 1661, have so passionately protested against the conduct of this business, and have exempted from pardon whomsoever shall afterwards be found guilty of this most base and disloyal usage of the King; of which in its time.</p>
                     <p>Before this adventure, which the King would have avoided, if the insolence of the prevailing Houses at <hi>Westminster</hi> could have been by any means rebated, his Majesty had courted the Parliament to a Peace by several Letters and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages from <hi>Oxford</hi>;<note place="margin">

For conceiving that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treaties hitherto proved ineffectual, chiefly for want of power in those persons that treated, as likewise because those from whom their power was derived (not possibly having the particular information of every several debate) could not give so clear a judgment as was requisite in so important a business; his Majesty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desires that he may have the engagement of the two Houses at</hi> Westminster, <hi>the Commissioners of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland, <hi>the Mayor, Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council and Militia of</hi> London, <hi>of the chief Commanders in Sir</hi> Thomas Fairfax <hi>his Army, for his Majesties free and safe coming to, and abode in</hi> London <hi>or</hi> Westminster, <hi>with such of his Servants and Train, not exceeding the number of three hundred, for the space of forty days; and after the same time, for his free and safe repair to any of his Garrisons,</hi> Oxford, Newark, Worcester, &amp;c. <hi>which he shall appoint, there to have a Personal Treaty with his two Houses, to begin with the three heads which were Treated on at</hi> Oxford. <hi>And for the better ingredience and expedition thereto, will commit the great trust of the Militia for seven years into the hands of a mixt number of his own and their party; and calls God to witness of his sincere intentions to Peace, and adjures them likewise to the same.</hi>

And do note likewise, that his Majesty desires not onely the engagement of the Parliament, but of the Lord Mayor, and the Officers of the Army, and the Scotch Commissioners; which is against the honour and priviledges of Parliament, those being joyned with them, who are subject and subordinate to their Authority.</p>
                     <p>They insist upon their Propositions as the safest and surest way to settle Peace, as well in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which Kingdom in his Letters he makes no mention.</p>
                     <p>In proceeding according to these just and necessary grounds for the putting an end to the bleeding calamities of these Nations, his Majesty shall have the glory to be the principal instrument in so happy a work, and they (however misinterpreted) shall approve themselves to God and man. <hi>But what?</hi>

observation ariseth, <hi>viz.</hi> that in some sort it may be said (what was spoke of the Roman Civil Wars, That all Nations and people were engaged in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Fate of <hi>Caesar</hi> or the Senate) that the whole World was concerned in our English Confusions: for by this black list of Auxiliaries from the other side of the Line, and such remote Regions (it being also unquestionable how dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously and designedly all our potent Neighbours thrust themselves in at our Breaches) our troubles and intestine feuds may be allowed to pretend to a like obnoxious greatness and reputation; since the fame of our conflagration and incendiaries flew to such distant and scorched Climates.

                     <p>So that while we shall now in its order and time repeat the subsequent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrations of the Party and Faction, the War being wholly finished, and they by the wise providence and permission of God possessed of all they quarrelled for; (though it is not fair to prepossess posterity) the Reader and after-times will suspect or think there is some <hi>Hiatus</hi> or deficiency in the Register of these troubles, if after such a promising conclusion (wherein the necessity and blessing of Peace seemed to be well accommodated in that juncture, besides the opportunity and obligation of the Parliament to make appear their many Declarations and Protestations, both in behalf of his Majesty and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) he shall be on a sudden, without any pause or expostulation, or account of the designes and practises of the Parliament and Army, plunged imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and involved again in new,<note place="margin">

To proceed then,</p>
                     <p>The state of the matter was briefly this: It was thought now high time by the principals of the conquering side, to share the Soveraignty; but the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing it, in regard of those mutual distrusts that waxed every day stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger betwixt the two factions of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi>

                        </note> delayed a while the actual fruition of their desires. The Bucket of interest went up and down a long while, one side secretly closing with the King in a seeming tenderness for his Rights and Person, to ballance the other, who by an obstinacy against him and his Government, engaged most of the first leaven of that tumultuous rabble to an adherence and strengthning of their party, from an expectation of spoil and preferment upon their Models, after their subversion of Monarchy. In these their distractions, the onely expedient for both, was to protract time, and await a more advantagious and favourable juncture for either of them, wherein to compass and accomplish their several aims and divided projections upon the Kingdom. Therefore the same publike ends and common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were the pretended causes of the War, were now declared to be insisted on, as to constant and perpetual security, <hi>viz.</hi> the Laws, Religion and Liberty.

                     <p>To this purpose the King was held out to his people as an obstinate person,<note place="margin">

might be grounded and expected. That in the mean time they would take care that the Common Enemy should take no advantage of raising a new War, (indeed their tyrannical method of Composition for their Loyalty in the first, might well make them as good as their words.)

As the Army marched, so did the King, making the limits of their Quarters to be his Court, until by leasurable journeys (and which were interrupted by several Expostulations, Expresses from <hi>Westminster</hi>) he came at last and took up his residence at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi> where appeared such a deal of Scotch bravery, especially among the Commanders of their Army, that the place appeared like the revived Court of King <hi>Iames</hi> after his assumption to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Every rag worn by them, being bought and purchased (if so fairly come by) with <hi>English</hi> gelt.</p>

                     <p>In this point,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Scots urge the Parliaments promise of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and their ordering the Covenant to be printed in most Forrain Languages.</hi>
                        </note> the Scots urged how many promises of UNIFORMITY the Parliament had made at their instances to them throughout the War; and that this Uniformity might be extensive, and become the Discipline of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches every where, and so be the Catholick Rule, had ordered the Covenant as a Model or Pattern to be printed in most of the Forrain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; that it should be a sin and shame to <hi>England,</hi> that all sorts of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, Sects and Schisms should be so multiplied; Liberty of Conscience not onely pleaded for, but in place already, and all the kindnesses done them, so unhandsomly slighted. And as to the Presbyterial Government to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished here, Exceptions were taken at the subordination of Church-Assemblies to Parliament, in the words prescribed, lest it should be interpreted as if the Civil Power were not onely conversant about matters of the Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but were formally Ecclesiastical, and to be exercised Ecclesiastically, and be counted such a Supremacy in the Church, as in the Pope and the late High-Commission of <hi>England.</hi> Next, they scrupled their Provincial Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners for judging of Scandal, there being no such Warrant for such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Lay with Spiritual Officers; which they suppose may be the laying of a New Foundation of the said High-Commission or Episcopacy. Thirdly, That admitting the Power of calling and convening a National Assembly be in the Civil Magistrates as positive, yet they cannot allow it privative or destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and that therefore such Assemblies may not be restrained to times of Session, the safety of the Church being the supreme Law; That therefore it should not be left <hi>ad libitum</hi> to the pleasure of the Civil Power, but that fixed times for their meeting might be appointed.</p>
                     <p>From this the English perceived that the Scotch Yoak would not fit their necks; and though they could be content with their Spirituals, there was no enduring of their Temporals: which consideration, with those Cavils printed and published, produced a Declaration of the House of Commons,<note place="margin">

                     <p>First, <hi>That his Majesty would pass an Act for nulling all Declarations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations against both or either Parliaments of</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Scotland. Secondly, <hi>The King to sign and swear the Covenant, and an Act for all persons in the three Kingdoms to do the like.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>An Act to take away Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. Fourthly, <hi>To confirm by Act the Assembly of Divines at</hi> Westminster. Fifthly, <hi>To settle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as the Parliament shall agree.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>In Vnity and Vniformity with</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>as shall be agreed by both Parliaments,</hi> [<hi>Kill Episcopacy point-blank, and shoot at Scotch wild-fowl at randome</hi>] Seventhly, <hi>An Act to be confirmed against Papists.</hi> Eighthly, <hi>Their Children to be educated in the Protestant Religion.</hi> Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>For taking away part of their Estates.</hi> Tenthly, <hi>Against saying of Mass in</hi> England. Eleventhly, <hi>And the same in</hi> Scotland <hi>if they please.</hi> Twelfthly, <hi>For observation of the Lords day, against Pluralities and Non-residents, and for Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and regulating the Vniversities.</hi> Thirteenth, <hi>That the Militia of the three Kingdoms be in the hands of the Parliament for twenty years, with power to raise money and suppress all Forces,</hi> &amp;c. Fourteenth, <hi>That all Honours, and Titles, and Dignities, conferred on any since the great Seal was conveyed from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> May 21 1642. <hi>be nulled; and that those</hi> who hereafter shall be made Peers by the King, shall not sit in Parliament, without consent of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Fifteenth, <hi>That an Act be passed to confirm all the Treaties between</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>and a Committee of both Houses to be nominated Conservators of the Peace between both Kingdoms.</hi> Sixteenth, <hi>An Act for the establishing the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of both Kingdoms of the THIRTIETH</hi> of JANUARY, 1643. <hi>touching Delinquents,</hi> with other qualifications added now, which were so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive, that they seemed accommodated for the fatal prognostick of that days Revolution in 1648. when <hi>accumulative treason</hi> (a word invented by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>) was extended to other the Kings Friends as to number, and in the amassed guilt of all impiety, afterwards practised upon the life of his Martyred Majesty; exempting from pardon all such as had proved themselves zealous and stout asserters of the King and his Cause; Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Bonds, Fines, and Securities abiding the rest: as to the King himself, they had left him nothing but the name and Title of Regality, the honour and support thereof being quite taken away. The rest of them were private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves and advantages for themselves and their partisans, and some relating to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi>; such an unreasonable miscellany, that the Scots for pretence of honour could not digest them, but scrupled at most of them, as they were framed at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for some of the reasons afore mentioned, but swallowed then, and were satisfied at their delivery at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> by the Solution of Two hundred thousand pounds, when in a peremptory manner, as will presently be related, they told him he must assent.</p>
                     <p>At the delivery of those Propositions on the 23 <hi>Iuly,</hi> the King asked the Commissioners if they had power to Treat; who replyed, No: then said the

                     <p>This Answer had a various reception in the House of Commons; it start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as who found it difficult to effect their purposes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by and with the King; it tickled the <hi>Independents,</hi> who did all they could, by thrusting in harsh words and terms, to make the King indisposed and averse to all. Both became very sensible the King was not the man they took him for, but a Prince of prudence and resolution; no evil Counsellors being to be taxed with the penning of this, as their custom was, except Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi>

                     <p>Most highly incensed therefore was the Parliament at this refusal of those means which they said their most elaborate prudence, and diligent ponderation of every circumstance (after so long a time) conducing to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms happiness, had prepared and digested to such an equal temperament of the rights of the King and the people.<note place="margin">

                     <p>His Majesty guessing at this their desperate and perfidious desertion of him, had sounded their Commissioners then attending him, in what condition or estate he was among them; whether at Liberty, or a Prisoner: and put the <hi>Dilemma</hi> upon them, If at liberty, why he might not dispose of himself any-whither? if in restraint, what did they mean by his assenting and signing the Propositions, which in no case could be valid or binding, if agreed by him while a Prisoner? To this the Scots had nothing to say, but their Covenant with the English, which they might not contravene; and that according to the above mentioned Resolves, which they now declared, he was to be rendred to such hands as the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> should appoint, who were expected every day upon that errand. They further excused themselves from their reception

and admission of his Majesty into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the danger and hazard they might incur, his party being not yet so disbanded, but that by his neer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and advantage of his person, they would resume their Arms and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and put that Nation in a worse broyl than before: and for conclusion, they told him, they were in no condition to entertain him in that state and dignity due to his person; the Treasure exhausted, and his Revenews eaten up: so that there was but one way for his Majesty to turn, which he might make hereafter large and convenient enough, by a present speedy complyance with his two Houses at <hi>Westminster.</hi>

The Effigie was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards placed in the uppermost Chancel in very great state, till a rude vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive fellow laid his prophane hands upon it, and so defaced it privately in the night, that it was by order removed. Very few condolements were made after, he being like to be soon forgotten, who had neither interest, nor relation to his Honour, remaining; dying childless, and leaving his Estate to be divided betwixt the Marquess of <hi>Hertford</hi> who married his Sister, and his Cozen <hi>Leicester De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereux,</hi> after his decease Lord Viscount <hi>Hereford,</hi> which onely title of all the rest he now enjoys; his Title and Dignity of the Earldom of <hi>Essex</hi> being transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long after to the Noble and most Loyal Family of the <hi>Capels,</hi> in the 13th year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the second.</p>
                     <p>The very soul of Presbytery now departed, that which actuated its mass and matter, the inform Schism in the Church, to a most unnatural division in the State, and armed its hands with Force and violence to propagate its dominion, and Magisterial Usurpation; when from pretentions of Ecclesiastical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it invaded the Civil Supremacy and Government: it was now culminant, and with this great Patron and Champion of it was come to its <gap reason="foreign">

But when this first great Pillar of it fell, (as it is observable, such Great Ones seldome go unaccompanied) it submitted to its period; its great blaze and flames it had raised waning into a glimmering and suspicious light, lookt upon rather as a Meteor or Exhalation, that any fixed Luminary, the ill influence thereof confirming our belief.

                           <hi>The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent parties divided.</hi>
                        </note>It will be therefore requisite to give an account here of the manner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of that rupture between them, it proving the rise of all those calamities that after befel the King. The Presbyterians were more numerous, the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents more active, vigilant and restless, watching all opportunities, and present both in publike and private Counsels: oft have they wearied out the House with long unnecessary debates, to unseasonable times of night; and when the Members of the other faction, being tyred and diseased, had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themselves, slipt in a Vote of great concernment, and carried it by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If in a full House any thing contrary or destructive to their designs was ready to pass, by putting in Proviso's, and perplexing the matter, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of further consideration of affairs of such importance, they so hinder'd it, that it dyed an <hi>Embryo</hi> abortive. Some of the Grandees of the other party they likewise so wrought upon, that they became false friends to their own side; the weaker sort of them they amused with fair offers. They scrued themselves by one means or other,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents subtile practices.</hi>
                        </note> by promises, preferments, largesses, into all manner of persons who could either hinder or advance their designs; and when they had proceeded so forward by this smooth way, they attained the rest by Menace and Threats, and the formidable insolence of their Army, which they had solely at their Devotion: yet notwithstanding they were shreudly put to it, and countermined by some eminent Patriots, whose indefatigable diligence and saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city was yet deluded by these following Artifices. Their prodigal liberality of bestowing 5000 l. and 10000 l. on some of the chief of the Presbyterian Members for their losses and sufferings, far beyond the value of them, was the first. This clearly begot in them a supine negligence of their main drift. Next, they surrogated and substituted in the place of those Members whom they had expelled for their Loyalty, men of mean fortunes, and wholly addicted to, and of the Army, who awed (by drawing their Troops thither,) the several Boroughs at their Elections, by which means they became at last a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent party in the House to carry any thing. But the main Engine was the Self-denying Ordinance, whereby all Members of either House were dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from bearing any Office Military or Civil,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The self-denying Ordinance, by which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians.</hi>
                        </note> and obliged to quit all their places of profit and preferment, that the publike business might be better atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. By this shift they heaved out many eminent Presbyterians, who were possessed of Places and Offices in the Treasury, Garrisons and Commands of like consequence, and put in their friends, or those whom the profit would soon render such, in their stead. So that by this device the Presbyterians were absolutely stript of all Power, and were wip'd and cheated out of the <hi>Militia,</hi> for which they began the War, and which they had violently wrested from their Soveraign. Who cannot here but admire the wonderful steps and traces of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice?</p>
                     <p>The Presbyterians were not wholly insensible whitherto this tended; but they could not with any pretence of honesty resist the plausibility of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, lest they should seem all along to have sought themselves, and not the Kingdoms good. A cry very rife and loud, put into the heads of some Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical and Levelling Scriblers of the Fanatick Rabble, by <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Privy Council. They cast about therefore to check and counterplot this grand Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem by another as subtile,<note place="margin">

                        </note> and altogether more feisible and necessary, that was, to disband the Army, since they perceived they had lost their Command and disposal of it.

He upon conference with his Privado <hi>Ireton,</hi> agrees to spread it among the Souldiers, and withal to add their own comment, That the Parliament by the prevailing Vote of some unsound Members, were resolved to disband the Army, and cheat them of their Arrears, and send them in a wanting condition into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be Butchered by the Rebels, for having thus faithfully served them in <hi>England.</hi> And we may soon imagine what a quarrel and hatred this begot in the lump of the Souldiery against the Parliament; but it was best judged by the irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able malice against them, which they made appear not long after, in those most insolent and daring affronts, in assaulting, seising, impeaching, and secluding them several times in the two years ensuing. From this Military rage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation they were presently put upon an unpractised, and as licentious as dangerous a design, even to the Authors themselves (as it afterwards proved, though their confident ambition made them venture it) of chusing out two out of each Company and Troop to be their Adjutators,<note place="margin">

                     <p>By these ADJUTATORS, or AGITATORS, a Protestation of the Army was drawn and published, where they declared not to disband nor go for <hi>Ireland,</hi>

                                 <p>This surprize of me tells the World, That a KING cannot be so low, but he is considerable; adding weight to that Party where he appears.</p>
                                 <p>This motion, like others of the times, seems excentrick and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, yet not well to be resisted or quieted: Better swim down such a stream, than in vain to strive against it.</p>
                                 <p>These are but the struglings of those Twins, which lately one womb enclosed, the younger striving to prevail against the elder: what the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have hunted after, the <hi>Independents</hi> now seek to catch for themselves.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="134" facs="tcp:53069:72"/>So impossible is it for Lines to be drawn from the Center, and not to divide from each other, so much the wider, by how much they go farther from the point of union.</p>
                                 <p>That the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> should from division fall to confusion, is no wonder; but for those that pretend to build <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to divide their tongues and hands, is but an ill <hi>omen,</hi> and sounds too like the fury of those Zealots, whose intestine bitterness and divisions were the greatest occasion of the last fatal destruction of that City.</p>
                                 <p>Well may I change my Keepers and Prison, but not my captive condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; onely with this hope of bettering, that those who are so much professed Patrons for the Peoples Liberties, cannot be utterly against the Liberty of their King: what they demand for their own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they cannot in reason deny to mine.</p>
                                 <p>In this they seem more ingenuous than the Presbyterian Rigour, who, sometimes complaining of exacting their Conformity to Laws, are become the greatest Exactors of other mens submission to their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Injunctions, before they are stamped with the Authority of Laws, which they cannot well have without my consent.</p>
                                 <p>'Tis a great Argument that the <hi>Independents</hi> think themselves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numitted from their Rivals service, in that they carry on a business of such consequence, as the assuming my person into the Armies custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without any Commission, but that of their own will and power. Such as will thus adventure on a King, must not be thought over-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest or timorous to carry on any designe they have a mind to.</p>
                                 <p>Their next motion menaces and scares both the two Houses and the City; which soon after acting over again that former part of tumultuary motions, (never questioned, punished, or repented) must now suffer for both; and see their former sin, in the glass of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent terrours and distractions.</p>
                                 <p>No man is so blinde, as not to see herein the hand of Divine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; they that by Tumults first occasioned the raising of Armies, must now be chastened by their own Army for new Tumults.</p>
                                 <p>So hardly can men be content with one sin, but add sin to sin, till the latter punish the former. Such as were content to see me and many Members of both Houses driven away by the first unsuppressed Tumults, are now forced to flie to an Army, to defend themselves against them.</p>
                                 <p>But who can unfold the Riddle of some mens justice? the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houses who at first withdrew, (as my self was forced to do) from the rudeness of the Tumults, were counted desertours, and outed of their places in Parliament.</p>
                                 <p>Such as stayed then, and enjoyed the benefit of the Tumults, were all asserted for the onely Parliament-men: now the flyers from, and forsakers of their places, carry the Parliamentary Power along with them, complain highly against the Tumults, and vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by an Army; such as remained and kept their stations, are looked upon as Abettours of Tumultuary insolencies, and Betrayers of the freedom and Honour of Parliament.</p>
                                 <p>They will find that Brethren in iniquity are not far from becoming

And yet I call God and the World to Witness, with what patience I have endured a tedious Restraint, which so long as I had any hopes that this sort of my suffering might conduce to the Peace of my Kingdoms, or the hindring of more effusion of Blood, I did willingly undergo: But now finding by too certain proofs, that my continued patience would not only turn to my Personal ruine, but likewise be of much more prejudice than furtherance to the Publike good; I thought I was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53069:80"/>
bound as well by Natural as Political Obligations to seek my safety, by retiring my self for some time from the publike view both of my Friends and Enemies. And I appeal to all indifferent men to judge, if I have not just cause to free My self from the hands of those <hi>who change their Principles with their Condition, and who are not ashamed openly to intend the destruction of the Nobility by taking away their Negative Voice,</hi> and with whom the Levellers Doctrine is rather countenanced than punished. And as for their intentions to My Person, their changing and putting more strict Guards upon Me, with the discharging most of all those Servants of Mine, who formerly they willingly admitted to wait upon Me, does sufficiently declare. Nor would I have this My Retirement misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted: for I shall earnestly and uncessantly endeavour the settling of a safe and well-grounded Peace wherever I am, or shall be, and that (as much as may be) without the effusion of Christian Blood. For which, how many times have I desired, prest to be heard, and no ear given me? And can any reasonable man think, that (according to the ordinary course of affairs) there can be a settled Peace without it, or that God will bless those who refuse to hear their King? Surely no! nay, I must further add, that (besides what concerns My self) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less all other chief Interests have not onely a hearing, but likewise just satisfaction given unto them, (to wit, the <hi>Presbyterians, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Army,</hi> those who have adhered to Me, and even the <hi>Scots</hi>) I say there cannot (I speak not of miracles, it being in My opinion a sinful presumption in such cases to expect or trust to them) be a safe or lasting Peace. Now as I cannot deny, but My Personal secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the urgent cause of this My Retirement, so I take God to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that the Publike Peace is no less before My eyes: and I can finde no better way to express this My Profession, (I know not what a wiser man may do) than by desiring and urging that all chief Interests may be heard, to the end each may have just satisfaction. As for example, The Army (for the rest, though necessary, yet I suppose not difficult to content) ought (in My judgment) to enjoy the Liberty of their Consciences, have an Act of Oblivion or Indempnity, (which should extend to all the rest of My loving Subjects) and that all their Arrears should be speedily and duely paid; which I will undertake to do, so I may be heard, and that I be not hindered from using such lawful and honest means as I shall chuse. To conclude, Let Me be heard with Freedom, Honour, and Safety, and I shall instantly break through this Cloud of Retirement, and shew My self to be <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi>

Yet now, though the Country was ten times more oppressed, no remedy could be had; the Army under pretence of Lodging, Fire, and Candle, taking all other necessaries: for which if at any time they pretended to offer money, yet durst none take it for fear of greater damage, the spoiler being only triable by a Council of War. This, the Souldiers were taught likewise by their Adjutators to load upon the Parliament,<note place="margin">Cromwel <hi>and his supernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, the cause thereof.</hi>
                        </note> through their neglect of paying them; when indeed the supernumeraries with which <hi>Cromwel</hi> daily recruited the Army, without any Authority, far beyond the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53069:83"/>
pay or number established, was the cause of the Arrears, and this oppression of Free-quarter; for upon complaints thereof made in the House, the Army being quartered in several Brigades, supernumeraries have been disbanded in one Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, their Arms taken by their Officers, and shortly after they have been listed again in another Brigade, and their Arms sold again to the State after a while, to new arm them. By which means <hi>Cromwel</hi> had amassed a Magazine of such, which being lodged in the City, and rumoured by some zealots to be for arming some Reformadoes, were now upon examination found to belong unto Him, and so the business was husht up; which if they could have fastned upon the other Party, should have been noised for horrid Treason.</p>
                     <p>By this grievance of Free-quarter they were doubly and trebly payed, taking it in one place, and Composition for it in another, perhaps in three or four places at once, by false Billets; yet nevertheless, though by these tricks they owed money to the State, they demanded and compelled an Ordinance from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to secure their Arrears of the 24 of <hi>December,</hi> whereby they had the two thirds of Delinquents Estates, mentioned or comprehended in the three first qualifications of them, in the Propositions sent to the King at the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi>; and all the money arising out of the remaining part of Bishops Lands, appointed to be sold by former Ordinances;<note place="margin">

                        </note> particularly at <hi>Smithfield-bars London,</hi> where the Butchers who then paid Excise for the Flesh sold, at two shillings in the pound, rose and fired the Excise-house neer adjoyning, with all the Papers of Books of Account; for which several of them were tryed, but acquitted: thereafter, that Duty upon Cattle, as likewise upon all Salt made in the Kingdom, was wholly laid aside. But a most severe injunction was now made for the continuance of the rest, and the refractory threatned with exemplary punishments.</p>
                     <p>So that while <hi>Cromwel</hi> could finde Men and Arms at such a rate, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament such heaps of Money by several Revenues, it was in vain to think of a Peace, when such visible powerful advantages subserved to those wicked designes of inthralling King, Parliament, City and Kingdom, now mainly prosecuted by the Adjutators; but so lendly and unseasonably, that <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to palliate his secret impiety, abandoned one of the Ringleaders, one <hi>White,</hi>

                              </note>THe necessity of complying with all engaged Interests in these great distempers for a perfect Settlement of Peace, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty finds to be none of the least difficulties he hath met with since the time of His afflictions; which is too visible, when at the same time that the two Houses of the English Parliament do present to His Majesty several Bills and Propositions for His Consent, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do openly protest against them: so that were nothing in the case but the consideration of that difference, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty cannot imagine how to give such an Answer to what is now proposed, as thereby to promise himself his great End, <hi>A Perfect Peace.</hi> And when his Majesty further considers, how impossible it is (in the condition he now stands) to fulfil the desires of his two Houses, since the onely ancient and known ways of passing Laws, are either by his Majesties personal Assent in the House of Peers, or by Commission under his Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; He cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at such failings in the manner of Address which is now made unto him; unless his two Houses intend that his Majesty shall allow of a Great Seal made without his Authority, before there be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration had thereupon in a Treaty; which as it may hereafter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the security it self, so for the present it seems very unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to his Majesty. And though his Majesty is willing to believe that the intention of very many in both Houses, in sending those Bills before a Treaty, was onely to obtain a Trust from him, and not to take any advantage by passing them to force other things from him, which are either against his Conscience or Honour; yet his Majesty believes it's clear to all understandings, that these Bills contain (as they are now Penned) not onely the devesting himself of all Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and that without possibility of recovering it, either to him or his Successors (except by repeal of these Bills) but also the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Concessions guilty of the greatest pressures that can be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject, as in other particulars, so by giving an Arbitrary and unlimited power to the two Houses for ever, to raise and levy, for Land and Sea-service, of what persons (without distinction and quality) and to what numbers they please; and likewise for the payment of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, to levy what monies, in such sort, and by such ways and means, (and consequently upon the Estates of whatsoever persons) as they shall think fit and appoint; which is utterly inconsistent with the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and his Majesties Trust in Protecting them: so that if the major part of both Houses shall think it necessary to put the rest of the Propositions into Bills, his Majesty leaves the world to judge how unsafe it would be for him to Consent thereunto; and if not, what a strange condition (after passing those four Bills) his Majesty and all his Subjects would be cast into. And here his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty thinks it not unfit, to wish his two Houses to consider well of the manner of their proceeding; That when his Majesty desires a personal Treaty with them for the setling of a Peace, they in answer propose
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53069:85"/>
the very subject matter of the most essential part thereof, to be first granted; a thing which will be hardly credible to posterity: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majesty Declares, That neither the desire of being freed from this tedious and irksome condition of life his Majesty hath so long suffered, nor the apprehension of what shall befal him in case his two Houses shall not afford him a personal Treaty, shall make him change his Resolution of not-consenting to any Act, till the whole be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Yet then he intends not onely to give just and reasonable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the particulars presented to him; but also to make good all other Concessions mentioned in his Message of the <hi>16</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi> last, which he thought would have produced better effects, than what he finds in the Bills and Propositions now presented unto him.</p>
                           <p>And yet his Majesty cannot give over,<note place="margin">His Majesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain presseth for a personal Treaty.</note> but now again earnestly presseth for a personal Treaty, (so passionately is he affected with the advantages which Peace will bring to his Majesty, and all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) of which he will not at all despair, (there being no other visible way to obtain a well-grounded Peace.) However his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is very much at ease within himself, for having fulfilled the Offices both of a Christian and a King, and will patiently wait the good pleasure of Almighty God, to incline the hearts of his two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to consider their King, and Compassionate their fellow-Subjects Miseries.</p>

No, I will speak, and that to all my people, (which I would rather have done by the way of my two Houses of Parliament, but that there is a publike Order neither to make Addresses to, nor receive Message from me.) And who but you, can be Iudge of the Difference betwixt me and my two Houses? I know none else: for I am sure it is you, who will enjoy the happiness, or feel the misery of good or ill Government; and we all pretend who shall run fastest to serve you, without having a regard (at least in the first place) to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interests. And therefore I desire you to consider the state I am and have been in this long time, and whether my Actions have more tended to the publike, or my own particular good. For whosoever will look upon me barely as I am a man, without the liberty (which the meanest of my Subjects enjoys) of going whither, and conversing with whom I will; as a Husband and a Father, without the comfort of my Wife and Children; or lastly, as a King, without the least shew of Authority or power to protect my distressed Subjects; must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude me, not only void of all natural Affection, but also to want Common Vnderstanding, if I should not most chearfully embrace the readiest way to the settlement of these distracted Kingdoms. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so on the other side, do but consider the Form and Draught of the Bills lately presented to me, and as they are the conditions of a Treaty, ye will conclude, that the same spirit which hath still been able to frustrate all my sincere and constant endeavours for Peace, hath had
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53069:88"/>
a powerfull influence on this Message: for though I am ready to grant the substance, and comply with what they seem to desire; yet, as they had framed it, I could not agree thereunto without deeply wounding my Conscience and Honour, and betraying the Trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in me, by abandoning my people to the Arbitrary and Vnlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Power of the two Houses for ever, for the levying and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Land and Sea-Forces, without distinction of quality, or limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Money and Taxes. And if I could have passed them in terms, how unheard-of a condition were it for a Treaty, to grant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand the most considerable part of the Subject Matter? How ineffectual were that debate like to prove, wherein the most potent Party had nothing left to ask, and the other nothing more to give? so consequently how hopeless of mutual compliance? without which, a settlement is impossible. Besides, if after my Concessions, the two Houses shall insist on those things from which I cannot depart, how desperate would the condition of these Kingdoms be, when the most proper and approved Remedy should become ineffectual? Being therefore fully resolved, that I could neither in Conscience, Honour, or Prudence pass those four Bills, I only endeavoured to make the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and justice of my denial to appear to all the world, as they do to me, intending to give as little dissatisfaction to the two Houses of Parliament (without betraying my own Cause) as the matter would bear. I was desirous to give my Answer of the <hi>28</hi> of <hi>December</hi> last to the Commissioners sealed (as I had done others heretofore, and sometimes at the desire of the Commissioners) chiefly because when my Messages and Answers were publikely known before they were read in the Houses, prejudicial interpretations were forced on them, much differing, and sometimes contrary to my meaning. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, my Answer from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> was accused of dividing the two Nations, because I promised to give satisfaction to the Scots in all things concerning that Kingdom; and this last suffers in a contrary sense, by making me intend to interest <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Laws of this Kingdom, (the which nothing is or was further from my Thoughts) because I took notice of the Scots Commissioners protesting against the Bills and Propositions, as contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and Engagements of the two Kingdoms. Indeed, if I had not mentioned their dissent, an Objection, not without some proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, might have been made against me, both in respect the Scots are much concerned in the Bill for the Militia, and several other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and my silence might seem to approve of it. But the Commissioners refusing to receive my Answer sealed, I (upon the Engagement of theirs and the Governours Honour, that no other use should be made or notice taken of it, than as if it had not been seen) read and delivered it open unto them; whereupon what hath since passed, either by the Governour in discharging most of my servants, redoubling the Guards, and restraining me of my former liberty, (and all this, as himself confest, meerly out of his own dislike of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, notwithstanding his beforesaid Engagement;) or afterwards by the two Houses, as the Governour affirms, in confining me within the circuit of this Castle; I appeal to God and the World, whether
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53069:89"/>
my said Answer deserved the Reply of such Proceedings; besides the the unlawfulness for Subjects to Imprison their King. That by the permission of Almighty God I am reduced to this sad condition, at which as I no way repine, so I am not without hope, but that the same God will in due time convert these afflictions unto my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In the mean time, I am content to bear those crosses with Patience, and a great equality of minde. But by what means or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion I am come to this relapse in my affairs, I am utterly to seek; especially, when I consider that I have sacrificed to my two Houses of Parliament (for the Peace of my Kingdoms) all, but what is much more dear to me than my Life, my Conscience and Honour; desiring nothing more, than to perform it in the most proper and natural way, A <hi>Personal Treaty.</hi> But that which makes me most at a loss, is, the remembring my signal comply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But it may be easily gathered hence, how these men intend to govern, who have used me thus. And if it be my hard sate to fall together with the Liberty of this Kingdom, I shall not blush for my self, but much lament the future miseries of my People, the which I shall still pray to God to avert, whatever becomes of me.</p>

Sir <hi>Matthew Boynton</hi> (the former Governour) returning to his Allegeance, and securing the Town on that score. <hi>Tinmouth</hi>-Castle was likewise seized on for the King by Major <hi>Lilburn,</hi> one of (that famous) <hi>Iohn Lilburn</hi>'s Brothers, who only seriously repented of his disloyalty, and would have made satisfaction, to the redemption of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and his own Honour, but was presently, and before he had time to fortifie and prepare for defence, set upon by Forces sent by Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi> from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> who stormed the Castle and carried it, putting the Souldiers and <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> himself to the Sword.</p>
                     <p>Return we now to the distressed and starved <hi>Colchester,</hi> where the Defendants had eaten up most of their Horses, in expectation of relief from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, being encouraged to hold out by Letters from the Lord <hi>Langdale</hi> of their Armies speedy advance to their succour. But understanding by information from the Enemy without, that that Army was totally defeated, these unfortunate Heroical Royalists were forced to bethink themselves of a Surrender; which <hi>Fairfax</hi> would now accept upon no other terms (after much debate by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) than the Common Souldiers to quarter for life, and the Officers to mercy. These hard Terms were disputed within, and were at the first generously scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and thereupon a resolution was taken, seconded with a Protestation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they engaged one to another, by the assistance of God, to break through the Enemy on <hi>Friday</hi> night the 23 of <hi>August:</hi> but through the dissatisfaction or personal consideration of some of the Grandees, this noble Designe was hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Souldiers by the delay and after-consultation of it (it being respited a day longer) being enjealoused as if the Officers would leave the Foot in the action, and shift for themselves (and it was impossible to attempt their Line without Foot and Pioneers) they were forced to accept of the former Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">Colchester <hi>surrendred</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust 28. <hi>on hard terms.</hi>

They all of them undauntedly received this sad Message; Sir <hi>Charles</hi> only desiring some little time longer to prepare himself, both in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his peace with God, and concerns of his Relations; which he said he asked not for fear of death, or in hope of life, which he would not value from their hands. But this was refused by <hi>Ireton,</hi> who, on purpose to make the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral odious, then the only impediment to his Father-in-Law's Greatness (which was afterwards removed by a more innocent wile) had urged him to this murder.

                     <p>Accordingly they were brought unto the place of Execution (Sir <hi>Bernard Gascoyn</hi> being upon more humane consideration as a Stranger reprieved) where after two or three ejaculations,<note place="margin">

                     <p>This odious Fact (for which the Sufferers Memories, and the due Renown of their Virtue and Valour shall flourish, and the Names of those blood-thirsty men that perpetrated and counselled it, shall stink and rot) was most highly resented: For it was very obvious, that it was done on purpose to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate and grieve the King, with whom at the same time the Parliament had Voted (and were proceeding in) a Treaty; of which we come next to speak: leaving these two Heroes to a resuscitation of their Glories, being without any partiality of affection declared by those that knew them, one of them the best for Horse-service, and the other for Infantry, that ever Commanded in their quality in the Kings Armies.</p>

                           <p>And to this end, you your selves have laid most excellent grounds: For what can I reasonably expect more, than to Treat with Honour, Freedom, and Safety, upon such Propositions as you have, or shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto me, and such as I shall make unto you? But withal remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is the definition, not names of things, which makes them righly known; and that without means to perform, no Propositions can take effect. And truly my present condition is such, that I can no more Treat,<note place="margin">Demands of the Parliament to recal those Votes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by which his Subjects are frighted from coming or sending to him.</note> than a blind man can judge of colours, or he run a race who hath both his Feet fast tied together; wherefore my first ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary demand is, That you will recall all such Votes and Orders, by which people are frighted from coming, writing, or speaking freely to me. Next, that such men of all Professions whom I shall send for, as of necessary use to me in this Treaty, may be admitted to wait upon me.

me by your Votes. For how can I Treat with Honour, so long as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are terrified with Votes and Orders against coming to speak or write to me? And am I honourably Treated, so long as there is none about me (except a Barber who came now with the Commissioners) that ever I named to wait upon me?

                              </note> And for Safety (I speak not of my Person, having no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension that way) how can I judge to make a safe and well-grounded Peace, until I may know (without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise) the true present state of all my Dominions, and particularly of all those, whose Interests are necessarily concerned in the Peace of the Kingdoms?

                                 <p>I must further Declare, that I conceive there is nothing can more obstruct the long-hoped-for Peace of this Nation, than the illegal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of them that presume from Servants to become Masters, and labour to bring in Democracie, and to abolish Monarchy. Needs must the total alteration of Fundamentals be not only destructive to others, but in conclusion to themselves; for they that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to rule by the Sword, shall at last fall by it: for Faction is the Mother of Ruine, and it is the humour of those that are of this Weather-cock-disposition, to love nothing but Mutabilities; neither will that please them but only <hi>pro tempore,</hi> for too much variety doth but confound the senses, and make them still hate one folly, and fall in love with another.</p>
                                 <p>Time is the best cure for Faction; for it will at length (like a spreading Leprosie) infect the whole Body of the Kingdon, and make it so odious, that at last they will hate themselves for love of that; and like the Fish, for love of the Bait be catched with the Hook.</p>
                                 <p>I once more declare to all my loving Subjects, and God knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no this may be my last, that I have earnestly laboured for Peace, and that my thoughts were sincere and absolute, without sinister ends; and that there was nothing left undone by me, that my Conscience would permit me to do. And I call God to witness, that I do firmly conceive, that the interposition of the Army (that Cloud of Malice) hath altogether eclipsed the glory of that Peace, which began again to shine in this Land. And let the world judge, whether it be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for an Army to contradict the Votes of a Kingdom, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by pretending for Laws and Liberties to subvert both. Such acts as these must produce strange consequences, and set open the flood-gates of ruine, to over-flow this Kingdom in a moment. Had this Treaty been only mine own seeking, then they might have had fairer pretences to have stopt the course of it; but I being importuned by my two Houses, and they by most part of the Kingdom, could not but with a great deal of alacrity concur with them in their desires, to the performance of so commodious a work. And I hope by this time, that the hearts and eyes of my people are opened so much, that they plainly discover who are the underminers of this Treaty.</p>
                                 <p>For my part, I here protest before the Face of Heaven, that my own

afflictions (though they need no addition) afflict me not so much as my peoples sufferings, for I know what to trust to already, and they know not: God comfort both them and me, and proportion our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to our sufferings.</p>
                                 <p>And when the malice of mine Enemies is spun out to the smallest thread, let them know that I will by the Grace of God, be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to suffer, as they are active to advance my Sufferings; and mine own Soul tells me, that the time will come when the very Clouds shall drop down vengeance upon the heads of those that barricado themselves against the proceedings of Peace; for if God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a blessing to the Peace-makers, needs must the Peace-breakers draw down curses upon their heads.</p>

If you saw how unmanly and unchristian this implacable disposition is in Our Ill-willers, you would avoid that spirit. Censure Vs not for having parted with too much of Our own Right; the Price was great, the Commodity was Security to us, Peace to Our People. And We are confident another Parliament would remember how useful a Kings Power is to a Peoples Liberty; and of how much We have devested Our Self, that We and they might meet again in a due Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way, to agree the Bounds for Prince and People. And in this give belief to Our Experience, never to affect more Greatness or Prerogative, than what is really and intrinsecally for the good of your Subjects (not satisfaction of Favourites.) And if you thus use it, you will never want means to be a Father to all, and a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince to any you would be extraordinarily gracious unto. You

may perceive all men trust their Treasure where it returns them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; and if Princes, like the Sea, receive and repay all the fresh Streams and Rivers trust them with, they will not grudge, but pride themselves to make up an Ocean. These considerations may make you a Great Prince, as your Father is now a low one; and your State may be so much the more established, as mine hath been shaken. For Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have learned (We dare say) that Victories over their Prince, are but Triumphs over themselves; and so will be the more unwilling to hearken to Changes hereafter. The English Nation are a sober peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, however at present under some infatuation. We know not, but this may be the last time We may speak to you or the world pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. We are sensible into what hands We are fallen; and yet we bless God we have those inward refreshments, that the malice of Our Enemies cannot disturb.</p>

Those men which have forced Laws which they were bound to observe, will find their Triumphs full of troubles. Do not think any thing in this world worth obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by force and unjust means. You are the Son of Our Love, and as We direct you to what We have recommended to you, so We assure you We do not more affectionately pray for you, to whom We are a Natural Parent, than We do that the antient Glory and Renown of this Nation be not buried in Irreligion and Fanatick Humour, and that all Our Subjects (to whom We are a Politick Parent) may have such sober thoughts, as to seek their Peace in the Orthodox Profession of the Christian Religion, as it was established since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Kingdom, and not in new Revelations; and that the antient Laws, with the Interpretation according to known Practices, may once again be a hedge about them; that You may in <hi>due time Govern,</hi> and they be Governed as in the fear of the Lord.</p>

And if the King did Levy War first against the Houses, there is no Law to make it Treason in him: And for them to declare Treason by an Ordinance, when the matter of Fact is not proved; nor any Law extant to judge it by, is very unreasonable.</hi> The Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Denbigh</hi> said,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Lords cast out the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed for</hi> 7 <hi>days.</hi>
                        </note> they would be torn in pieces before they would assent with the Commons; so the Lords cast off the Debate, and cast out the Ordinance, and adjourned for seven days.</p>
                     <p>This netled the Commons, who thereupon resolved to rid their hands of King,<note place="margin">

                              <hi>they do expect you should either confess or deny it; if you deny it, it is offered in the behalf of the Nation to be made good against you; their Authority they do avow to the whole world, that the whole Kingdom are to rest satisfied in; and you are to lose no more time, but to give a positive Answer thereunto.</hi>

                              </note> I would have satisfied my self with the Protestation I made the last time I was here against the Legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be tried by any Superiour Jurisdiction on Earth; but it is not my case alone, it is the Freedom and Liberty of the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and do you pretend what you will, I stand more for their Liberties. For of Power without Law, may make Laws, may alter the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what Subject he is in <hi>England,</hi> that can be sure of his Life, or any thing that he calls his own; therefore when I came here, I did expect particular Reasons,<note place="margin">

                        <p>HAving already made my Protestations, not onely against the illegality of this pretended Court, but also that no earthly Power can justly call Me (who am your King) in question as a Delinquent; I would not any more open my Mouth upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, more than to refer my self to what I have spoken, were I in this case alone concerned. But the duty I owe to God in the preservation of the true Liberty of my People, will not suffer me at this time to be silent: For, how can any free-born Subject of <hi>England</hi> call life, or any thing he possesseth, his own, if Power without Right may daily make new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and abrogate the old Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of the Land? which I now take to be the present case. VVherefore when I came hither, I expected that you would have endeavoured to have satisfied me concerning these grounds which hinder me to answer to your pretended Impeachment; but since I see that nothing I can say will move you to it (though Negatives are not so naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will shew you the Reasons why I am confident you cannot Judge me, nor indeed the meanest man in <hi>England:</hi> for I will not (like you) without shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reason, seek to impose a belief upon my Subjects.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">No proceeding just, but what is warranted by the Laws of God or man.</note>There is no proceeding just against any man, but what is warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by Gods Laws, or the Municipal Laws of the Country where he lives. Now I am most confident, this days proceeding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be warranted by Gods Law; for on the contrary, the Authority of obedience unto Kings is clealy warranted, and strictly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both in the Old and New Testaments; which if denied, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy instantly to Prove: and for the Question now in hand, there it is said, That <hi>where the word of a King is, there is Power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou? Eccles. 8.4.</hi> Then for the Law of this Land, I am no less confident that no learned Lawyer will affirm that an Impeachment can lie against the King,<note place="margin">No Impeachment can lie against the King.</note> they all going in His Name: and one of their Maximes is, <hi>That the King can do no wrong.</hi> Besides, the Law upon which you ground your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, must either be Old or New: if Old, shew it; if New, tell what Authority warranted by the Fundamental Laws of the Land hath made it, and when. But how the House of Commons can erect a Court of Iudicature,<note place="margin">The House of Commons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erect a Court of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature.</note> which was never one it self, (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the world to Iudge: And it were full as strange that they should pretend to make Laws without King or Lords House, to any that have heard speak of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And admitting, but not granting, that the People of <hi>Englands</hi> Commission could grant your pretended Power; I see nothing you can shew for that: for certainly you never asked the question of the tenth

Now Sir, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that an hasty Sentence once past, may be sooner repented than recalled; and truely the self-same desire that I have for <hi>the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, more than my own particular,</hi> does make me now at last desire, that having somethimg to say that concerns both, I desire before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be given, that I may be heard in the Painted Chamber before the Lords and Commons: this delay cannot be prejudicial to you, whatsoever I say; if no Reason, those that hear me must be Judges; if it be Reason, and real for the <hi>Welfare of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject,</hi> I am sure on it, it is very well worth the hearing; therefore I do conjure you, as you love that you pretend, I hope it is real, <hi>the Liberty of the Subject, the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that you will grant me the hearing, before any Sentence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(Sirs) I must shew you, both how you are out of the way, and put you in a way. First, You are out of the way; for certainly all the ways you ever had yet, as far as I could finde by any thing, is in the way of Conquest:<note place="margin">

                           </note> certainly this is an ill way; for Conquest, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is never just, except there be a just and good cause, either for matter of wrong, or a just Title; and then if ye go beyond the first quarrel that ye have, that makes it unjust at the end, that was just at first: for if there be onely matter of Conquest, then it is a great Robbery; as a Pirate said to <hi>Alexander, That he was a great Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, himself was but a petty Robber:</hi> And so Sirs, I think for the way that you are in, you are much out of the way.

                  <p>The new Estates of <hi>England</hi> liked not well of his so neer neighbourhood and entertainment, in a Commonwealth too, and thought their greatness so formidable, that it could perswade (without any more trouble) all places and people to his dereliction; and to this purpose, they insinuated the same inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Myn Heer Pauw</hi> (the then Dutch Resident here) who was sent over by the States, as also another Embassador from the French, besides the earnest intervention of the Scots Commissioners, to intercede for the King) with whom they had several discourses about the dangerous greatness of the Prince of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range:</hi> and 'tis reported the Man was made by them. He departed hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>March,</hi> very well pleased with the pronts of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie.</p>
                  <p>Though they could not reach the King, and though some of his best Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had outreached them, yet many others could not so escape them.

But this was but a puny vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime to the ensuing Sacrifices: for the old pretence of Justice challenged new does, by the evidence of its former administration, which would have been thought but a step purposely made to their ambitious Usurpation, if other blood, not so obnoxious to their grand designe, should not (in pursuance of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared impartial bringing to condigne punishment all sorts of Delinquents) be offered up to their Idol of Liberty. There was also another Reason of State in it; for that the House of Lords being so easily laid aside, it was requisite while the first violence was yet recent, utterly to disanimate the Nobility by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as lawless, more bloody infringement of their Priviledges.</p>

His resumed argument (when all would not do) was the Honour of the Sword, which seeing how little those (that should have justly asserted it) did value, he resolved to trouble himself no longer at their Bar; but being demanded what he could say more for himself, replied nothing; but with a chearful resignation of himself to providence, expected his Doom, then impending over him. The Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> came not to their Bar while they had finished with the other Lords, by reason of his indisposition which delayed him at <hi>Warwick</hi>-Castle; but such was their impatient pretensions to Justice, that they got him conveyed to their High Court, and as they had done by the rest, over-ruled his plea (which he argued in much weakness, taking a spoonful of some Cordial every foot between his words) of quarter given, and concluded him in the same Sentence.</p>

These were the Orders given, but not executed: for notwithstanding it did not much exceed a mile whither the Foot were to go, yet through the ignorance or negligence of the Officers that were to conduct them, many hours were spent ere they came at the place: whither when they were come, they found the Work so wretchlesly advanced by Master <hi>Welsh</hi> the Engineer, and (to help all) themselves kept such negligent Guards, that many judged it was done on purpose; and that these neglects proceeded from those lurking seeds of discord between the Kings and the <hi>Nuntio's</hi> Parties: For it is certain, that about that time, upon an apprehension that things went on too prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously with the Lord Lieutenant, there were Letters written to <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> about broaching a New War, in case <hi>Dublin</hi> had been taken. Whatever the grounds of these failings were, the Enemy never stood to examine, but being troubled to see a Fort designing there, (where, with so much ease they might not onely be kept from all Forrage and succour by Land, but intercourse with the Sea also) and perceiving the posture they were in, destitute of Horse to Guard them, resolved upon a desperate Sally to disturb this Work, which they happened to make about eight of the clock in the morning, when his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy who had been on horse-back most part of the night (as his constant custom was since his coming neer <hi>Dublin</hi>) was newly laid him down in his Tent to take his rest, however the <hi>Westminster</hi>-Scandals of those days did asperse him.</p>

                     <p>The Surrender of <hi>Dublin</hi> truly had been made unto the people of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the arts of those that were at that time in Government amongst them, a most odious thing; though those very persons knew well enough, it was themselves and not the Lord-Lieutenant, that was in the fault, by twice foully violating their Publike Faith with him: First, in breaking a Peace made, and solemnly published both at <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny</hi> (the Respective seats of the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and the Council of the Confederates) and in seconding that Act (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having imprisoned the Lord <hi>Muskery,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Talbott,</hi> Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> Master <hi>Brown,</hi> Master <hi>Belings,</hi> and the rest of their Supreme Council, that had made the Peace, and still stood honestly to what they had done) with bringing their Armies before <hi>Dublin,</hi> where having caused the burning and destruction of those quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Town it self must have been lost unto them, it upon overture of a Treaty with the Parliament they had not sent Men and Supplies to rescue it. And next, in the breach of that solemn Engagement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> as soon as (upon belief of their resolution to return unto their Duty) the Treaty was broke off, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Parliament sent home again. Could it be expected that after two such acts as these, any wise man would trust or treat with the Irish any more, whilst the Government was still in the same mens hands? who after all this, wrought the whole Assembly to declare they would never have any Protestant Governour more, and namely not the Lord-Lieutenant; and who were not ashamed at the same time, both to annul the Peace, and yet acknowledge that the forementioned Gentlemen that had been makers of it, and suffered in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it, had neither exceeded their instructions, nor done any thing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming honest men.</p>

                        </note> I am confident that no Threats nor Flatteries could have perswaded men out of <hi>England</hi> thither, in hopes of reaping the fruits of their fellows labours, in that destroyed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

                     <p>For they have <hi>Waterford, Galloway,</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> three of the strongest and most considerable Towns of the Kingdom still untaken; any of which, if they be well Garrisoned (as questionless now they are) will be neer a Summers work to reduce: The Forts of <hi>Duncannon</hi> and <hi>Sligo,</hi> the Castles of <hi>Caterlo, Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, Charlemont</hi> and <hi>Neanagh,</hi> are not easie purchases: the Province of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> is still preserved entire by the Lord <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> who will be able to bring 4000 men of his own into the field, now that <hi>Galloway</hi> and his Country is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cleared from the infection of the Plague; which begins to rage greatly in the Enemies quarters, as <hi>Corke, Youghall, Wexford,</hi> and <hi>Dublin</hi> it self; <hi>Kilkenny, Clonmel,</hi> with several places thereabouts being left desolate with it. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Clare</hi> in <hi>Munster</hi> brought unto the Lord-Lieutenant at a Rendezvouze at the same time above 2000 men, wherewith his Excellency (being invited by the Magistrates) was ready to march into <hi>Limerick</hi> to Garrison that place, and to make it his residence.</p>

Who after having mastered the greatest part of <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Leimster,</hi> their supplies from <hi>England</hi> coming in but slowly, have made bold at last with the people they flattered with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and altered their manner of proceedings, taking from them by force what they pleased, and violating their protections given; making not nice to tell them, they suffered them to possess their Estates but during pleasure, and till they could have Planters to put into their rooms: by which kind of clear deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have so lost and made desperate the Natives, that lamenting their former too ready compliance with the Enemy, they now called for the Lord-Lieutenant again, and taking Arms in their hand, began to rise in all quarters of the Kingdom, so that it is impossible for a greater power than <hi>Ireton</hi> hath there to attend to the suppression of them all.</p>

                           <hi>An Account of the last actions of the Marquess of</hi> Montross.</note> A Captain whose unexampled Atchievements have fam'd a History; and were its Volume ten times bigger, it would yet be disproportionate to the due praises of this matchless Heroe.

                     <p>After his departure out of <hi>Scotland,</hi>

                           <hi>He was offered to be Capt. of the</hi> Scots <hi>Guards to the King of</hi> France.</note> as you have read, he betook himself to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where he was proffered the Captainship of the <hi>Scots</hi> Guards to that King, a place of great Honour and Revenue; but being delayed by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who affected not that Nation, and his spirit aiming at his own Princes Service, he betook himself to the King then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured after the Murther of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, a like new Commission for <hi>Scotland</hi>; but being thwarted therein by Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> then residing there likewise (and his confident Friends the Earls of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi>) who was aemulous of his former glories in the Government, and late War of that Kingdom; he betook himself to the Emperor at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he was presently proffered the Command of an Army of 10000 men, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of any other General;<note place="margin">

                        </note> but the Peace being concluded betwixt the <hi>Swede</hi> and the Emperour, he departed, upon pursuit of his adventure into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having obtained a Commission from the King; and in order to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, was furnished with four ships from the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> some supplies from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and 1500 Arms from the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> (and some Horse promised under General <hi>King</hi> from thence) and a little neat Frigat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>With these the Marquess (as is supposed) fearing lest he should have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command to desist from his purpose, because the Treaty betwixt the Prince and the Scotish Commissioners was now very neer a conclusion, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate himself and those that were with him into a most inevitable ruine.

all those great Levies and Aids, those mighty preparations for the Invading of a Kingdom settled in a posture of War, and well forewarned of his intentions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted not above the number of six or seven hundred at the most, strangers and all. The Common Souldiers which adventured over with him, most of them <hi>Holsteyners</hi> or <hi>Hamburgers.</hi> He had sent him by the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the arming of such Gentlemen as should upon his arrival betake themselves to his Party (as before) 1500 Arms compleat for Horse, Back, Brest, Head-piece, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, Pistols, and Swords; all which (after his defeat in <hi>Cathnes</hi>) were taken untouch'd. With this small preparation, it was a desperate action to attempt so mighty a business. And although his touching first upon the Island did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his number, and gave him almost the beginning of an Army; yet were those barbarous people so raw and unacquainted with Discipline, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a manner useless and unserviceable. 'Tis true, the Inhabitants of those Isles were a people in former times very fierce and warlike,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Marquess of</hi> Montross <hi>Arms for the King in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> and have under their own Captains made many great Impressions into the very heart of the Kingdom. But whether it was the policie of the late Kings to leave them untrained of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to break their natural fierceness, or because their own Captains being quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or cut off, they cared not much to engage under any other; certain it is, that Kingdom for 200 years last past hath not made less use of any they had under their Jurisdiction, nor have they at this present less opinion of any Scots for Military courage and valour. And this may be alledged as a great cause of their remissness and unweildiness, whilst they were in the Marquesses Service. I told you a little before of <hi>Montross</hi>'s whole strength which did accompany him from <hi>Germany,</hi> whereof two ships (with near upon a third part) were sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but by storm of weather (which is both frequent and dangerous) amongst those Northern Islands,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>His ill success.</hi>
                        </note> they were lost with all the men and Arms, nothing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: This was another check, and as it were a warning and a forerunner of the sad event which followed. But the business being fatal, he must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute his own endeavours towards that destruction which his cruel fortune had provided for him. For he being nothing terrified with this success, sends out a second party, which making a more prosperous Voyage, landed at <hi>Orkney,</hi> and entred the Island without any resistance; there being at that time no Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison or defence placed in any of those Islands by the States of <hi>Scotland:</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with these he sent several Commissions for levying Horse and Foot. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately there were several dispatched to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Islands adjacent for that purpose: the people of the Country being in no condition to resist these Officers, endeavoured in hopes of favour as much as they could to further the designe: And those who were not so earnest, were by their own neighbours, favourers of the Cause, and these violent Commissioners, forced to take up Arms. Not long after, landed. the Marquess himself with the rest of his Company, together with those Gentlemen which were resolved to partake of his fortune; amongst whom were several persons of note: Colonel <hi>Hurry</hi> was there, a man who had engaged in all Quarrels, but never prospered in any; the Lord <hi>Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draught</hi> (for his Kinsman the Lord <hi>Napier</hi> was left in <hi>Holland</hi>) Colonel <hi>Iohnson</hi> a resolute man and an old Souldier, Colonel <hi>Gray</hi> a German Souldier, <hi>Harry Graham</hi> his own natural Brother, Colonel <hi>Iames Hay</hi> of <hi>Naughton,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgety, George Drummond</hi> of <hi>Ballach.</hi> For he had employed as was thought Colonel <hi>Sibbalds</hi> (his Companion heretofore) as his Agent in <hi>Scotland</hi>; but he was apprehended at <hi>Musselburgh,</hi> and did accompany his General in death upon the same Scaffold. The Marquess continued a considerable time in <hi>Orkney,</hi> raising of Forces, and strengthning himself with such Recruits as the place would afford: Neither was there any preparation at all made in <hi>Scotland</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess him of these Islands, either because it might be thought a difficult busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to assail him within those places naturally guarded with a rough and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sea, or because they knowing his strength, expected a better opportunity of him, as they found indeed, within the Country.</p>

                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:53069:135"/>After this poor rabble of silly creatures was amassed, he resolved at last to Embarque; and to that purpose gathers all the Boats he could finde, ships his men, and in a short space Lands them all upon the point of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> which is the farthest land to the North-west of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The people having some expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the carriage of his former souldiery, and now far more dreading the name of Forrainers, partly by the terrible reports which were constantly given out of him, fled away in heaps, many of them not stopping till they came to the chief City <hi>Edenborough,</hi>

                        </note> and there gave the terrible Alarm to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then sitting. The Commanders were immediately summoned, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with all possible hast to get the standing Forces in readiness; and a Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze (in order to the States Command) was hereupon presently enjoyned at <hi>Brechin</hi> Northward.<note place="margin">

                        </note> Colonel <hi>Straughan</hi> (who was then in high esteem with the great ones for his Valour lately expressed in the English service, and his Zeal to the Presbyterian Cause, much extol'd at that time) had an ample and particular Commission granted to him by the Parliament, to command a choice party of Horse, which should not be subject to <hi>David Lesly</hi>'s Orders, but might Engage and Fight with the Enemy at his best advantage. With these (being not above 300) he advanced before the Army;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>David Lesley</hi> with the rest of the Horse, and <hi>Holborne</hi> with the Foot marching after him. In the mean time the Marquess advanced, but very slowly; and that he might not be mistaken, (since all the world was much astonished at this Invasion now whilst the King was upon a Treaty) he published a second Declaration,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Marq Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</hi>
                        </note> wherein he laboured to clear himself of any aspersion of sinister ends. That his intention was onely against some particular persons, who had against the Laws of the Kingdom, raised and maintained a War against the Kings Father, and did now by their subtile practises endeavour to destroy the Son also. That he intended nothing against the Generality of the Kingdom.<note place="margin">

But the Country, for several Causes, did not come to second him as he expected. For the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi>

                           <hi>Earl of</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him.</hi>
                        </note> a potent man in those parts, his Lands being next to the place where the Marquess then was, raised a great power of his Tenants and Friends, and did his best to terrifie and hinder all that were willing to joyn with him. And though he found himself unable to deal with the Marquess's Forces, yet did he stop all intercourse betwixt him and his Friends. And those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had heretofore followed him, and yet inclined to assist him, knowing the danger of the enterprse, considering the fewness of his number, and that his Souldiers were much undisciplined, and unlike to the former with whom he had done so great things, began to be averse, and have a suspition of the event. Yet have I heard some say, which knew well enough the situation of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that if he had not been suppressed in the nick, he might have gained such strength amongst the Hills, as might have given him leisure enough to have strengthened his own Party, and tired out the Enemy. Howsoever, he was not altogether unmindful of a retreat: There is in that Country a Castle called <hi>Dumbath</hi>;<note place="margin">Dumbath-<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle surrendred to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                        </note> the Lord or Laird thereof is the head of a very Antient Family, but no friend of the Marquesses. This Gentleman (having left his House in the keeping of his Lady and some servants) fled to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> The Lady (though the place was naturally fortified) yet upon summons delivered it to Colonel <hi>Hurry,</hi> (who was sent thither by the Marquess with a party of Foot to reduce it) upon conditions her Goods and Estate might be secured, and she with her Servants suffered to march away. <hi>Hurrey</hi> having placed a Governour and a Garrison (as he thought) sufficient for the defence of the place, returned to the Marquess, who was advanced to the place, or neer it, where he was to lose at one Throw both his Life and Fortune. The Marquess hearing of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies approach, made his whole Forces March at a great Trot, to recover a Pass which they were not very far from, when he himself in the Van-guard discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the first party, which was <hi>Straughan</hi>'s Forlorn-hope,<note place="margin">

The second Party was Commanded by <hi>Straughan</hi> himself, and the Rear-guard by Colonel <hi>Ker,</hi> for he had divided them into three Bodies: But now the first party being very neer, there was a Forlorn-hope of 100 Foot drawn out to meet them, who giving fire upon them, put them to a disorderly retreat; but being immediately seconded by <hi>Straughan</hi>'s Party, they made good their Charge, and so terrified the Islanders with that breach, that most of them threw down their Arms, and called for Quarter. Onely the Dutch-companies (after they had bestowed a Volley or two amongst the Horse) retreated into some shrubs hard by, and there very valiantly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselves a while,<note place="margin">

There were killed in this business to the number of 200. taken 1200; very few escaped. For the whole Country being in Arms, especially <hi>Sunderland</hi>-men (who came not to the Fight, but to the Execution) they killed or took Prisoners all such as fled. In that skirmish was taken the Standard which he had caused to be made on purpose to move the affections of the people, with this Motto, <hi>Iudge and revenge my Cause, O Lord</hi>; and the Portraict of the late King beheaded, exactly well done.

                     <p>The Marquess (after he saw the day was absolutely lost) threw away his Cloak, which had the Star on it (having received the Order of the Garter a little while before:) his Sword was likewise found, and not very far off his Horse, which he had forsaken: For so soon as he had got clear off that ground where the Skirmish was, he betook himself to foot; and lighting upon one of that Country, or one of his own Souldiers (I know not whether) took his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Apparel from him, and so in that Habit conveyed himself away: But such narrow search being made for him, he could not long escape; yet he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the open fields three or four days, without any notice gotten of him. At last the Laird of <hi>Aston</hi> (being in Arms with some of his Tenants, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in that search) happened on him: He had been one of his followers before.<note place="margin">

The Marquess knowing him, and believing to finde friendship at his hands, willingly discovered himself; but <hi>Aston</hi> not daring to conceal him, and being greedy of the reward which was promised to the Apprehender by the Council of State, seized upon him and disarmed him. 'Tis said he profered great sums for his Liberty; which being in vain, he desired to dye by the hands of those that took him, rather than be made an object of misery and shame (as he knew very well he should) by his enraged Enemies. But neither of his desires was granted, but in place of them a strong Guard set on him, and so conveyed to <hi>David Lesley.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>and conveyed to</hi> David Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</note> 
                        <hi>Straughan</hi> having atchieved his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness with great expedition, and freed the State from this much-feared danger, returned to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> leaving the rest of the business to <hi>Lesley</hi> and <hi>Holborn,</hi> where he received great rewards and thanks for his Eminent Service; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the great heart-burning of <hi>David Lesley,</hi> who seeing a rival risen up to his honour, and one whom he lookt upon as an upstart Souldier, have so great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, fretted not a little. Howsoever, forwards he moves to accomplish the rest of the work, which was now of no great consequence; for there rested nothing within the Country, but onely the Castle of <hi>Dumbath,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dumbath-<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle yielded to the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
                        </note> which being out of all hopes of relief after the defeat, so soon as they were perfectly assured thereof by some Prisoners they knew, yielded the Garrison. The Governour was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at mercy; the Souldiers being Dutch, were upon terms to return home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. There was nothing else to be done, save the reducing of the Islands, and the Town of <hi>Kirkwall</hi> in <hi>Orkney,</hi> where Colonel <hi>Iohnson</hi> and Colonel <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Graham</hi> were left, when the Marquess passed over to <hi>Cathnes:</hi> but <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tross</hi> (either because he could not spare any Souldiers, or because he expected
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53069:136"/>
better success) had left them almost naked, though there were several places in those Isles which might have been made very Tenable. Colonel <hi>Iohnson</hi> having had notice of the defeat, with those that were with him, took shipping, and returned from whence he came; so did <hi>Harry Graham</hi> likewise, else both of them had tasted of the same sauce which their General did. Thus <hi>Lesley</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces entred without any resistance, seized upon the Arms which <hi>Montross</hi> had brought thither, together with two pieces of Ordnance, the Queen of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> present; the little Friggot of 16 Guns which lay in Harbour, the Master of her being gon ashore into one of the Islands, and the Company seeing the event of the business, revolted, and brought in that likewise.

                        </note> there was a solemn day of Thanksgiving appointed through the whole Kingdom, Bonfires, Shooting of Ordnance, and other testimonies or joy: but many of the Gentry who had been under his Command before, having now engaged with him again, were no partakers in this joy. For some of his Papers being taken, many of them were afterwards discovered, and suffered in their Estates. The Marquess being now in the Custody of his mortal Enemies, from whom he could not expect the least favour; yet exprest a singular constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and in a manner a carelessness of his own condition. Coming to his Father-in-laws house, the Earl of <hi>Southesk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Montross <hi>visits his Children at his Father-in-laws the Earl of</hi> Southesk.</note> where two of his Children were, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured liberty from his Guard to see them; but neither at meeting or parting could any change of his former countenance be discerned, or the least expression heard which was not suitable to the greatness of his spirit, and the same of his former actions. 'Tis Memorable of the Town of <hi>Dundee,</hi> where he lodged one night, though it had suffered more by his Army than any else within that Kingdom, yet were they amongst all the rest so far from insulting over him; that the whole Town testified a great deal of sorrow for his woful condition; and there was he likewise furnished with Cloaths suitable to his Birth and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

The people who were assembled in great multitudes, and were many of them heretofore very desirous to see this spectacle, could not now refrain from tears; and those who had heretofore wished him all misfortune, began to be shaken with the first Scene of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.

                     <p>These pestilent and alike dangerous Papers, (which in effect seemed rather an Agreement than cause of quarrel between the Antagonists) were warily considered by some, even of themselves, who loved the King, as of sudden and desperate consequence to His Majesties Person and Government, so highly vilified and disregarded; so that a Declaration (to the liking of the Kirk) was extorted from him, that there might no cause of pretence remain, either for their obstinate carriage towards Him, or ready Compliance with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

                     <p>On Sunday at night, the first of <hi>September,</hi> the English (making at most not above 12000 men) came to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> whither the <hi>Scots</hi> (keeping close at their Heels) came also and drew up their whole Army, consisting of between 20 and 24 thousand men, upon a high Hill within a mile of the Town, to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement at first of the English; but despair adding resolution to their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they presently drew out in Battalia, in the Corn-field neer adjoyning, and so stood all night, being Encamped upon a neck of Land, whose breadth was not a mile and a half from Sea to Sea; so that they were by Land quite cooped up. In confidence therefore of an assured Victory, <hi>David Lesley</hi> who Commanded this Kirk-Army in chief, began to advance as early as the Sun next morning, and drew down the Hill, fixing at the foot thereof, and about four a clock in the afternoon brought down his Train, there being a great Ditch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both the Armies. That night the English (by Command) placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves close to the Ditch, and placed their Field-pieces likewise in every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they might be in a readiness in case the Enemy should attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing upon them, who were vainly expecting terms of a Rendition; boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had them in a worle Pound than the King had the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> at <hi>Lestithiel</hi> in <hi>Cornwall.</hi>

                     <p>On Tuesday-morning at four of the Clock, a Brigade of the English Army drew down to possess themselves of a Pass upon the Road between <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Berwick</hi>; which being had, they might with the more ease and advantage make their way home, and in order thereto, pass over to the Enemy, to fall upon them.<note place="margin">Dunbar <hi>fight,</hi> Sep. 3.</note> This Brigade consisted of three Regiments of Horse, of Major-General <hi>Lambert</hi>'s, Commissary-General <hi>Whaley</hi>'s, and Colonel <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s, and two of Foot. This gave the <hi>Scots</hi> a great Alarm, and a sore dispute happened about the Pass, which lasted above an hour, the great Guns playing in the mean time against both the Bodies. At length that stout Brigade gained and possessed the Pass, much gallantry and bravery being shewed on both sides.

                     <p>Nor were their Lords and Superiours at home in much better condition of minde, being confounded and distracted at this strange and most unexpected dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster.

These were the rigid Kirk-men, whose peevish obstinacy this remarkable success of the English was so far from reclaiming, that in the conclusion they totally prevaricated from the interest of their Nation.</p>

The Royalists onely, and the King himself, by all manner of tenderness and condescentions, studying the common preservation, and suffering any thing from these, though uncertain friends, rather than expect it from so implacable an Enemy. And in some sort it may be said, that this overthrow did much serve to conciliate both interests: for the Kirk could not now defend it self with its own Arms, and was constrained to accept of help from those they had rejected; so that the Earl of <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> and other English Royalists (we shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Scotch by and by) who were upon their departure, (none but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Massey, Graves</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> being permitted to stay) now continued there; so that the common voice then was, that the King had lost nothing in the discomfiture of that Army of the Kirk.

About the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>December</hi> the Marquess took shipping in a little Frigat called the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> of 28 Tuns and 4 Guns, and set sail from <hi>Galloway,</hi> followed by the Lord <hi>Inchiqueen,</hi> Colonel <hi>Vaughan,</hi> the Noble Colonels <hi>Wogan</hi> and <hi>Warren,</hi> and some 20 more persons of Honour, intending for <hi>France, Scilly,</hi> or <hi>Iersey,</hi> but happily landed at St. <hi>Malos,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Ianuary</hi>; whence they went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and gave the Queen-Mother an account of that Kingdom.

                     <p>The noise of these lucky Atchievements, had made most of the Neighbouring Princes consider a little further and more regardfully of this Commonwealth, more especially such whose Trade by Sea might be incommodated by their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val-force, which now Lorded it in gallant Fleets upon the adjoyning Seas. The first whom this danger prevailed upon, was the King of <hi>Portugal Iohn</hi> the 4. whose Fleet (laden with Sugar from <hi>Brasile</hi>) General <hi>Blake</hi> had met with, and for his entertainment of Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with his Fleet (now newly taken and dispersed) brought away 9 of them into the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> where they were delivered to the Commissioners for Prize-goods, then newly established by Authority of Parliament (upon which score the State received in few years many hundred thousand pounds, and was cheated of almost as much) whose names were, <hi>Blackwel, Blake, Sparrow</hi>; and upon the Dutch-War others particularly named for that very Affair, because of its continual Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

He had answer, that the Committee would report his Message to the Parliament: and so after a mutual Salutation upon the Embassadors rising from his Chair, he withdrew with the same attendance. But the reason he had no solemner Reception, was the pride and opimonastry the States had of themselves, by the Courtships and flattering Insinuations of the Spanish Kings Embassador, who had likewise desired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of them, and came with a most welcome acknowledgement of their Commonwealth; and it was a reciprocal kindness to him, not to allow the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> (his pretended Rebel, and a much less potent Prince) the said Grandeurs and Legatory Honours, considering besides the uninterrupted amity that had yet been maintained by the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>

She hung there neer half an hour, being pulled by the Legs and struck on the Brest by divers Friends, and above all received several stroaks on her Stomack with the But-end of a Souldiers Musquet. Being cut down, she was put into a Coffin, and brought to a house to be Dissected (before a Company of Physicians, according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment) by Doctor <hi>Petty</hi> the Anatomy-Reader in that University. When they opened the Coffin to prepare the Body for Dissection, they perceived some small ratling in her Throat; and a lusty Fellow standing by, thinking to do an act of Charity, stamped upon her Breast and Belly. Doctor <hi>Petty,</hi> Mr. <hi>Willis</hi> of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clerk</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Colledge, presently used means, and opening a Vein, laid her in a warm Bed, and caused one to go into Bed to her; and continued the use of divers Remedies, respecting her senselessness, Head, Throat, and Brest; so that it pleased God within 14 hours she spoke, and the next day talked and prayed very heartily, and was in a hopeful way of perfect health: whereupon the Governour presently procured her a Reprieve; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of people coming to see her, and magnifying the just providence of God in asserting her Innocency of Murther.

The Fleet having plied up and down in the sight of the Islanders, who were now in Arms to the number of 4000 Horse and Foot, came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor at <hi>Spikes</hi>-bay: and the <hi>Virginia</hi>-Merchant-Fleet arriving in <hi>December,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> advised it very advantageous for the Service, by the countenance of those ships which seemed as his reserve of Men of War, to attempt a landing; which accordingly was done by a Regiment of 700 men, made up with 150 Scotch

This was effected on the 17 of <hi>December,</hi> and the Islanders beaten up to their Fort, which on a sudden was by them deserted, after the loss of some 60 men on both sides, and the same Fort, and four pieces of Ordnance gained by them; and then the Seamen retreated again to the ships, which lay crusing up and down continually to intercept any Trade or Traffick coming thither. That inconvenience made some of the Islanders weary of the War: which Sir <hi>George</hi> very well understanding, negotiated with one Colonel <hi>Muddyford,</hi> a chief man in one part of the Island, about a peace and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and the conclusion of that transaction was <hi>Muddyford</hi>'s publike declaring for Peace,<note place="margin">

                     <p>On the Dutch side the Quarrel arose chiefly from a vain presumption that they were able to Master the English at Sea, for that people naturally measure their interest by Power, not by Justice; and there wanted not those great ones (rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi>) who mainly promoted this Rupture among the States themselves; and indeed they proved the Major part, hoping then well of his Majesties affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But they proving bad, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> being maritime Provinces, who had at first stickled for an alliance, as was tendered, had prevailed that three Embassadors, to wit, <hi>Myn Heeren Cats, Schaep,</hi> and <hi>Vandeperre,</hi> should immediately pass into <hi>England,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the notice of the above-mentioned Act, and resume the Treaty offered at the <hi>Hague:</hi> these being at last come, found very cool &amp; difficult tendencies or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Peace; for the case (as <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> said) was now altered: whereupon another Embassador the Lord <hi>Newport</hi> was sent, with private Instructions, (but no power to conclude) to enquire and inform himself, in what readiness and preparation the Parliament were for a Naval War; what discontents from the Royalist, or Faction in the Army, or Ambition among the Grandees them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, might effect to their advantage: where though he mist of the main, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s intended overthrow of the Parliament; yet they had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement enough to proceed on the designe of the Ocean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This was the main original and Bottom of that War, though hastened and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by some peremptory unexpected demands made here to their Embassadors, concerning the old duty of the Herring-fishing, the opening of the <hi>Scheld</hi> Custom-free from <hi>Middleburgh</hi> to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the Right of the Flag, and the business of <hi>Amboyna</hi>; which shewed they must now enter into League upon unequal Terms, and that the Market was risen, and the Exchange higher here than it was at the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53069:162"/>
                        <hi>Hague</hi>; so that without further trifling away time in such stiff-neckt debates, it was resolved that the Dutch Lyon should no longer couch and fawn, but raise up himself, and try by one seizure how the English Pulse beat, whether to Fear or more Courage; and so accordingly govern themselves. They had besides, about the time of this resolution, several Advertisements of injuries done their ships and Traffique upon account of the said Act, purposely laid in their way to give them the occasion.</p>

                     <p>To the riddance of this anxious Expectation, the Dutch had prepared a Fleet of War under their old Admiral <hi>Van Trump,</hi> and given order for the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy equipping of another Fleet of 150 sail, while the Parliament was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of an answerable Force; for General <hi>Blake</hi> plied then about the <hi>Downs</hi> with about 25 sail, and no more: thither the Dutch Fleet came, in pretence of Convoy to some of their Merchant-men from the <hi>Straights</hi>; attempted by some Parliament-Frigats under Captain <hi>Young</hi>; and thereupon ensued an Encounter,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The open rupture was honested on both sides with a punctilio of Honour, the Right of the Flag, which the Dutch could not without prejudice to their more Antient State give to this puisny Commonwealth; who contrarily more confidently expected it: and therefore take these accounts from several of their Commanders.</p>

very neer on the Weather-quarter; but before I fired, I called to the Captain my self to take in his Flag, but he said he would not; so then I commanded a Broad side and a Volley of small-shot to be fired on him, and I received the like from him again: thus we past some four or five Broad sides each at other, though I was forced to be at some further distance from him than at first, I fearing the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral would have laid me on Board on the Weather-side, he having fitted his ship, and come up Main-sail, and all to gain the Wind of me, forced me to keep the Wind of him; then Captain <hi>Reynolds</hi> being come up fair within shot of his Weather-quarter, having fired six Guns before at the Rear-Admiral, as he came in amongst us; so he fired part of a Broad side at the Vice-Admiral, just at that instant as he was taking in his Flag, the <hi>Recovery</hi> being come up even within shot just as his Flag was in, and the Rear-Admiral struck likewise: So I sent aboard the Admiral, That I did demand the Vice-Admiral, either in his person or his ship to carry into Port, to make good what damage was done: he told my Master, he did not meddle in the least himself as yet, as long as it was onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout striking the Flag, the which he said was now taken in; but if I sought any further matter, as the Surprizal of him or his ship, he was bound and would assist, she being the States-ship as well as he, not then knowing, or could take any notice of any further intentions: So I desired Captain <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Captain <hi>Chapman</hi> to come on board to consult with me what further to do in it; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer night; and it was the Judgement of us all, not to proceed any further in it, the Flag being taken in, by reason the Treaty being between the Nations at present, the case of Breach of the Peace might not be any way imputed on our part.

                              </note>I have dispatcht away this Express to your Honours, to give you an account of what past yesterday between us and the Dutch Fleet. Being in <hi>Rye</hi>-bay, I received intelligence from Major <hi>Bourn,</hi> that <hi>Van Trump</hi> with 40 sail was off the <hi>South-sand-head,</hi> whereupon I made all possible speed to ply up towards them, and yesterday in the morning we saw them at Anchor in and neer <hi>Dover</hi>-Road; being come within three Leagues of them, they weighed and stood away by a Wind to the Eastward: we supposing their intention was to leave us, to avoid the dispute of the Flag; about two hours after they altered their course and bore directly with us, <hi>Van Trump</hi> the headmost; whereupon we lay by, and put ourselves into a fighting posture, judging they had a resolution to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. Being come within Musquet-shot, I gave order to fire at his Flag, which was done thrice: after the third shot he let flie a Broad side at us. Major <hi>Bourn,</hi> with those ships that came from the <hi>Downs,</hi> being eight, was then making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: we continued fighting till night; then our ship being unable to sail, by reason that all our Rigging and Sails were extreamly shattered, our Mizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast shot off, we came with advice of the Captains to an Anchor about three or four Leagues off the <hi>Ness,</hi> to refit our ship, at which we laboured all the night<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> this morning we espied the Dutch Fleet about four Leagues distance from ours
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53069:163"/>
towards the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> and by advice of a Council of War, it was resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ply to windward to keep the Weather-gage, and we are now ready to let fail our Anchor this Tide: what course the Dutch Fleet steers we do not well know, nor can we tell what harm we have done them; but we suppose one of them to be sunk, and another of thirty Guns we have taken, with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of both; the Main-mast of the first being shot by the Board, and much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Hold, made Captain <hi>Lawson</hi>'s men to forsake her. We have six men of ours slain, and nine or ten desperately wounded, and 25 more not without danger, amongst them our Master and one of his Mates, and other Officers. We have received about seventy great shot in our Hull and Masts, in our Sails and Rigging without number, being Engaged with the whole Body of the Fleet for the space of four hours; being the Mark at which they aimed. We must needs acknowledge it a great mercy that we had no more harm, and our hope is the Righteous God will continue the same unto us, if there do arise a War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; they being first in the Breach, and seeking an occasion to Quarrel, and watching, as it seems, an Advantage to brave us upon our own Coast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              </note> the Wind being at North-East, the weather some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hazy, about ten in the morning we saw a great Fleet on the back-side of the <hi>Goodwyn-sand,</hi> which lay with their Sails hayl'd up, and drove to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the latter Tide of Ebb in land; about twelve they were so nigh, that we plainly descried them to be all Men of War, consisting of 41 in number, one whereof had a Flag at the Main-top-mast-head, the rest Jacks and Ancients, <hi>Hollands</hi> Colours, at which time they were neer the <hi>South-sand-head.</hi> There was in the <hi>Downs,</hi> the <hi>Andrew, Triumph, Fairfax, Entrance, Centurion, Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Assurance, Grey-hound,</hi> and the <hi>Seven Brothers,</hi> all the rest of the Fleet being with the General to the Westward, by whose special Command I wore a Flag at the Main-top-mast-head; the appearance of which I humbly conceive was one cause amongst others which moved their General to send two Frigats towards me; which as soon as I perceived plying into the Road, I sent out the <hi>Grey-hound</hi> to Examine them, and know the ground of their Approach; who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Answer to the Captain, That they had a Message from their Admiral to the Commander in the <hi>Downs</hi>; at which he made sail towards me, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to come in: the two Frigats came neer and saluted the Flag, and then the Captains came on Board, whose Names were, one <hi>Tyson,</hi> and the other <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> who brought this Message from their Admiral <hi>Van Trump,</hi> That by reason of much Northerly Winds, he with his Fleet was put to the Southward further than he intended, and having Anchored the day before off <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> many of his ships had lost Anchors and Cables, and so were forced to Leewards; but withal declared, that they had special Command from their Admiral to signifie thus much, That it was the onely cause of their coming to prevent any thoughts or misapprehensions, for that he had not the least purpose to offer injury to any of the English Nation; but for fear lest any Noise or Alarm should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven either at Land or Sea, he thought good to send this Message. And further, the one of them in discourse said, that their Admiral <hi>Trump</hi> would have come himself into the Road, but that he was not willing to breed any difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Flag, forasmuch as he had not order to take it down. To whom I replied, That I presumed there would be no new thing required of them, and neither more nor less would be Expected from them, but what they knew to be the Antient Rights of this Nation; and withal I desired them
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53069:164"/>
to return this Answer from me to their General, That their Message was civil, that our General was to the Westward, whom I looked for hourly, and that received; and if what they delivered was so intended, I desired the Reality thereof might be manifested by their speedy drawing off from this place with their Fleet, for else this their appearance would be otherwise expounded: and so I dismiss'd them, who made sail to their Admiral, who lay off the <hi>South-sands-head.</hi> I expected them to come into the Road every moment, and therefore was in readiness with the small strength I had under my charge. So soon as the two Frigats (before mentioned) came back to their General, they all made Sail and stood towards <hi>Dover,</hi> and there they came to an Anchor that Tide. At the first appearance of them, after I had made them certainly to be the <hi>Holland</hi>-fleet, I did according to my Duty give such an Account thereof to the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Council of State, as the time and other business would permit; and withal I immediately dispatcht a Ketch to our General, who met with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereof that night about <hi>Ness.</hi> All the next night we lay in readiness, our Anchors apeak, and kept two Frigats one at a distance from the other betwixt us and them, giving them Instructions to make a Signal to me, either night or day, that I might understand their motion, whether towards the General or elsewhere, to the end I might the better be able to order my self and the party with me to the best advantage, for security of the General's Fleet and our selves. In the morning about ten a clock I received-advice from the General, being a little to the Westward off <hi>Foulstone</hi>; and according to Order received from him, Calculated the Time and Tide, so that we might most opportunely make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of our Forces. About twelve a clock I set sail out of the <hi>Downs,</hi> the Wind being Easterly: immediately after I p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We Steered alongst, and when we came as high as the <hi>South-foreland,</hi> the <hi>Holland</hi>-Fleet was got off the Shore, and were half <hi>Channel</hi> over, plying to Windward towards <hi>Calice</hi>; at which time I saw our General and those with him; and within an hour after or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet bore up and made sail towards him: We hastened towards him, and hope I may say, seasonably came in, for by that time the Guns were fired betwixt the Admirals, we were with the Body of their Fleet, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with them from half an hour past four in the afternoon till it was dark: What Execution we did upon them they best know, I shall not determine it; but surely they were sensible of us, for they did their utmost to decline us, and avoid our coming near, which we endeavoured by all means; but their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral leading the Van, they all made Sail after him, and so shot themselves to Leeward of us, and so left the Rear of the Fleet to us, which we endeavoured to sever from the rest, and accordingly did in part break the Body; and some of us who were the neerest, and had the advantage of the Wind, fell upon the Stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, who I suppose found it hot work: the one of them of 30 Guns we took, which fought stoutly; another of the same force so lamed, her Main-mast shot down, and having much Water in Hold yielded, and the Captain thereof came into our Boat to save himself; the night coming on and no hope left him: I presume she sunk in the night. We not knowing what might be the Issue of this beginning, endeavoured to finde out our General, to the end we might receive Instructions how to order our selves in the morning, expecting certainly to prosecute the business then, for which end we presently came to Anchor because we would be neer them in the morning; but they did not stop, so that, in the morning we could scarce discern them at Top-mast-head; by which we concluded that they were bound over to the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> and were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to try it further at this time, and therefore that evening emplyed it up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Foulstone,</hi> and between that and <hi>Dover</hi> Anchored again, and the next day came into the <hi>Downs.</hi>

                                 <hi>Admiral</hi> Trump<hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the States of</hi> Holland.</note> sent by the Messenger that brought my Instructions aboard, since when I crossed the Sea before the <hi>Mase, Vilistrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Ostend,</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> until the 24 of the same Month, when we were forced to cast our Anchor, and stay there in a hard Weather and a rough Sea, until the 26 in the Morning. The Weather growing fairer, and being under sail, divers Captains of the <hi>Direction</hi> came aboard, complaining, That they had lost their Anchors and Cables, some having but two Anchors and two Cables left; so it was resolved, because the Wind did grow big, to go under the point of <hi>Dover,</hi> to prevent the loss of our ships. At one of the clock, coming before the <hi>Downs,</hi> we did send the Commander <hi>Iohn Thissen</hi> of <hi>Flissingen,</hi> and Captain <hi>Peter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> towards the <hi>Downs,</hi> to the Commander <hi>Bourn,</hi> who was there with some ships of the Parliament, whom they saluted in my Name, advertising him that we were bound to cruse the Sea about our Coast; and that having lost some Anchors by the last hard Weather, we were forced to Anchor under <hi>Dover,</hi> to help one another, and so to return to our appointed limits; having also no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order but to protect our Merchant-ships and Fishermen, and to maintain the Honour of our Country. That we therefore thought it fit to acquaint the said Commander with the same, because he should not suspect any thing to the contrary; who also did salute me, and thankt me for this notice. Upon the 19th, at two of the clock, we made sail, the Wind North-East, good Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sailing towards <hi>Calice,</hi> with intention to cross towards our Coast, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us of Cables and Anchors: Coming about <hi>Calice</hi>-cliff, we met with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ioris van Sanen</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> coming out the <hi>Streights,</hi> with Captain <hi>Hugeluyt,</hi> having in their company 7 rich Merchants ships, who are esteemed at above 50 Tuns of Gold, whom he left the 19th at Anchor right against <hi>Feverly,</hi> where about 12 ships of the Parliament did lye, and divers Frigats came to see them: and forasmuch as the said <hi>Ioris van Sanen</hi> upon the 12 of <hi>May,</hi> about <hi>Goutstart,</hi> was met by a Frigat of the Parliament, who fiercely set upon him to make him strike, and against whom he defended him neer about two hours, and so was left by the said Frigat; whereupon the said Commander <hi>Hugeluyt,</hi> and the said <hi>Van Sanen,</hi> did endeavour to finde out our main Fleet, and to give us notice of it; as he did accordingly, fearing much, that the said Merchants Vessels already might be taken: Thereupon I presently went thither, to take them under my protection, and if they were taken, to put them at Liberty, if it was possible, according to the seventh and eighth Articles of my Instruction of the 6 of <hi>May</hi> instant. Upon the way we met 15 Ships and Frigats of the Parliaments, among whom one was an Admiral, whom I intended to view, taking in all my Sails, except both my Marsh-sails, whom we did avail until the midst of the <hi>Stangs.</hi> Being within a Cannon-shot, he shot a Ball over our ship, we answering not, he shot another, to which we answered with one; presently he gives me a Broad side, being within a Musquet-shot, and shot all his side through our Ship and Sails: Divers were Wounded, some with the loss of their Arms, some otherwise; whereupon we presently gave him our Broad side, not knowing what they intended, which as yet I know not, because they did not speak a word to us, neither we to them; and we fell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to a general Fight. In the mean while came the Commander <hi>Bourn</hi> out of the <hi>Downs,</hi> with 12 of suchlike ships and Frigats mounted, as he told himself to the said Commander <hi>Iohn Thyssen</hi> and Captain <hi>Peter Alders,</hi> being aboard of him, with 60 to 70, and the Frigats with 38, to 50 pieces of Ordnance, who in the same while Assaulted our Fleet from behinde; and we fought thus from half an hour past four, till nine of the clock, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

parting us from one another; when both the Admirals a little beyond the reach of our Ordnance cast their Sails towards the Lee, to gather their Fleets, and to mend what was shot to pieces, we floted the whole night with a Light on every ship. The 20th in the Morning we saw the English Fleet driven Windward from us, who made sail and went towards <hi>Dover.</hi> We wanted two of our Ships, who were in the Rear of our Fleet; the Captains, <hi>Tuynman</hi>'s of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> and <hi>Siphe Fook</hi>'s of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> both ships of the <hi>Direction</hi>; whereof we found that of Captain <hi>Siphe Fook</hi>'s about noon, floating without Masts: The Skipper and the Officers declared unto us that they were taken by three ships of the Parliament, two hours after Sun-set, who took from aboard the Captain and Lieutenant, with 14 or 15 men more, and put instead of them many of the English; but they fearing that the ship would sink, they took the flight, after they had plundered all in hostile manner. They declared also, that they see the said <hi>Tuynman</hi>'s (being with them in the Rear of our Fleet) an hour before he was taken. We intend with this Easterly wind to cross to and fro, that we may finde out the said <hi>Streight</hi> vaerders, if it be possible, and with all other Ships with whom we may meet, to bring them safe in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

                                 <p>The Parliament, as they would be willing to make a charitable Construction of the Expressions used in the said Papers, endeavouring to represent the late Engagement of the Fleets to have happened without the knowledge, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the minde of Your Superiours: So when they consider how disagreeable to that profession the Resolutions and Actions of Your State, and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters at Sea have been, even in the midst of a Treaty offered by themselves, and managed here by Your Excellencies; the extraordinary preparations of 150 Sail of Men of War, without any visible occasion but what doth now appear (a just ground of jealousie in your own Judgements, when Your Lordships pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to excuse it) and the Instructions themselves given by Your said Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours to their Commanders at Sea, do finde too much cause to believe, That the Lords the States General of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> have an intention by Force to Usurp the known Rights of <hi>England</hi> in the Seas, to destroy the Fleets that are, under God, their Walls and Bulworks, and thereby expose this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to Invasion at their pleasure, as by their late Action they have attempted to do: Whereupon the Parliament conceive they are obliged to endeavour, with Gods assistance, as they shall have opportunity, to seek Reparation of the Wrongs already suffered, and Security that the like be not attempted for the future.</p>
                                 <p>Nevertheless, with this minde and desire, That all Differences betwixt the Nations may (if possibly) be peaceably and friendly composed, as God by his Providence shall open a way thereunto, and Circumstances shall be conducing to render such Endeavours less delatory, and more effectual than those of this kinde heretofore-used have been.</p>
                                 <p>This Answer Insinuating the intention of a War, being Communicated to the States General, they ordered their remaining Embassador to insist upon, and demand a <hi>Categorick</hi>-Answer (so was it called) to their Proposals in the Treaty, positively off or on; which being made,</p>

A most acceptable glad Complement to that Prince, but a sad reduction to his own minde, of that untamable force and injury, by which he was kept out from his Kingdoms; though now the progress of Providence did seem to verge and dispose events to the former course of the English Soveraignty: For the French King before the Cardinals return, gave most express assurance of his utmost as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the regaining his Crowns, as soon as he had setled his own, and was thereby rendered capable of doing it; and the Dutch had now likewise made overtures to him of espousing his Interest, and had granted him already free Ports in their Country for his Men of War to harbour in, and sell their Prizes they should take; and there was every day expectation of Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> to come and command a Squadron in that Service, upon the Kings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

E. but no further dispute or encounter happened) and thence Tyded it home, whither a Fleet of 100 sail from <hi>Roan,</hi> Guarded by ten Men of War, had slipt through the <hi>Channel</hi> a little before, during the Fight) having lost in all eleven Men of War, and thirty Merchants, 1500 killed, and as many wounded. On our side we had one ship, named the <hi>Sampson,</hi> shot through and through, and the Captain <hi>Button</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was sunk by him in the fight, the men being saved aboard other Vessels. Though it could not be dissembled that the Dutch had the worst of it, yet <hi>Van Trump</hi> was highly magnified for his good conduct, especially for his bringing off the Fleet from <hi>Calice,</hi> which argued the English had no more minde to fight, as they said in <hi>Holland.</hi> It was a stiff bout, especially the first day, and both English and Dutch did very gallantly,<note place="margin">

                           <hi>A Fight at</hi> Leghorn, March 2.</note>The next Encounter we had with this Enemy, was off <hi>Leghorn</hi>; for Captain <hi>Appleton</hi> (according to the Duke's Command) now put to Sea, divers Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier English freely adventuring themselves on board for their Countries Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the whole Coast being filled with Spectators to see the Combate; for the second of <hi>March</hi> was the longest day allowed for their stay in that Port: Now it was agreed between Captain <hi>Badiley</hi> and <hi>Appleton,</hi> that as soon as <hi>Appleton</hi> should see the Dutch set sail after him, for he was come from <hi>Porto Ferraio</hi> with 9 ships and a Fire-ship, that he should come out and make hast to joyn with him. Accordingly as soon as <hi>Badiley</hi> appeared, and the Dutch made semblance of making to him, the Wind blowing off the Shore, he weighed and came out; which the Dutch observing, they ceased their prosecution of <hi>Badiley,</hi> and turning the Helm, sailed directly upon <hi>Appleton,</hi> not any way to be relieved by <hi>Badiley</hi> as the Wind stood; who suspecting the event, with all speed got off to Sea and away, left when that Encounter was over, the whole brunt would fall also on him.

                     <p>That Foundation was laid upon the Ruines of Monarchy, the seeds whereof being laid in the King's Death, through a four years corruption of time, reared its Head now, though with a forced and <hi>precoce</hi> blade (a fading verdure that bespoke its unseasonableness and sudden perishment in the Family and Person of this Usurper) and exerted it self afterwards in the Hundredfold Fruits of an yielding and obedient people to their Rightful Soveraign.</p>
                     <p>It was perceivable now what Chimera's were in the projection of the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53069:175"/>
Commonwealth, which had so many ambitious and covetous Masters, every one of them managing his designe, and stretching it to the same measure of perpetuity; Sons and Nephews being brought into the Parliament, and the same Relations upon the score of Inherent Merit brought into the Army, and these interessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite and contrary to one another; the <hi>Single self</hi> (to the reducing of it to Monarchical Regiment in this very Democratick form) being solely inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; so that it was little labour for <hi>Cromwel</hi> with his Instrument in his Hand to charm the several divided Factions of that <hi>Individuum vagum,</hi> there being no other cement or obligation of their holding together, but that glutinous and sticking Guilt of the Kings Blood; and all places of Command and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit were already in the Hands of his Friends and Favourites, without any quarrel, or indeed without any perceivance of his Grand designe, which as it had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Kingdom to the destruction of the King, so was it after to weary them with another Parliament, by their barbarous and strange proceedings, and so recommend himself to the People.</p>
                     <p>He indeed took a very happy juncture for the Execution of it, just as the Scale of the Dutch difference was turned, and Victory was inclining to the English, and when a very potent Fleet was out at Sea, and the Moneys at the rate of 120000 l. <hi>per mensem</hi> was just coming in, and their Exchequer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Receipts pretty full with the several Incomes, Forfeitures, and Revenues: and as to his assurance of it, he wanted not any assistance, the Army onely his, and a third part of the Parliament joyning with him in his Conspiracy; which yet was a rash and hazardous venture. There had been no Law nor Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before; now even Prudence and Wisdom forsook the Grandees and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals in the proceeding Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>For it was then clearly and truly judged, that the setting up of this private, and indeed debaucht Person and Family in opposition to the King (the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of whose super-excellent Vertues, Gifts and Graces, and His cruel Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were yet recent) and His Heirs, would presently ruine the Usurper: for it being like to prove a War betwixt the Crown and <hi>Iack Cade,</hi> it was rightly concludible, that no longer than his Rebel-rout could be maintained and kept together, could it be expected that <hi>Oliver</hi>'s bloody house could stand.</p>
                     <p>The prosperous Rebel never boded this, nor did he think it within his conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: his great aims were upon the Parliament, an impotent and feeble Crue that stood upon his Crutches, and yet threatned to beat him with them; such Masters of Defence they were. This made him forsake his Wiles and <hi>Fabian</hi> delays, and with his Sword riddle the Oracle of this <hi>Delphick</hi> Parliament by its dissolution.</p>
                     <p>Fate never played such a frolick prank, nor was there ever such a Scene of Mirth in all her Mazes and Varieties of Government. Nor often do wicked great men survive the infamy and dishonour of their Actions, and live the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous obloquie and reproach of themselves: but as if God would invert the threatned punishment of the breach of the fifth Commandment, these unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled parricides were decreed to outlive the desire of Life, and to see all their Greatness buried; their Reputation abroad, and their Dread at home, fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such Ignominy and Disgrace, that it was turned to a Ballad, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>The news of this Luciferian fall, was quickly spread throughout the City, and from thence into the Kingdom, being related and received with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable gladness, while the Members slunk away, muttering to themselves the affront they had received, and laying their Heads together how to retrieve themselves; for loath they were to suffer this violence, or acknowledge their Dissolution, which they would by no means hear of.

                                 <p>After it had pleased God not onely to reduce <hi>Ireland,</hi> and give in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but so marvelously to appear for his people at <hi>Worcester,</hi> that these Nations were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a great degree of Peace, and <hi>England</hi> to perfect quiet, and thereby the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had opportunity to give the people the Harvest of all their Labour, Blood, and Treasure, and to settle a due Liberty both in reference to Civil and Spiritual things; whereunto they were obliged by their Duty, their Engagements, as also the great &amp; wonderful things which God hath wrought for them: it was matter of much grief to the good and well-affected of the Land to observe the little progress which was made therein; who thereupon applied to the Army, expecting redress by their means; notwithstanding which, the Army being unwilling to meddle with the civil Authority in matters so properly appertaining to it, it was agreed, that his Excellency and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, which were Members of Parliament, should be desired to move the Parliament to proceed vigorously in reforming what was amiss in Government, and to the setling of the Commonwealth upon a foundation of justice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; which having done, we hoped that the Parliament would seasonably have
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53069:176"/>
answered our expectations: But finding (to our grief) delays therein, we renewed our desires in an humble Petition to them, which was presented in <hi>August</hi> last; and although they at that time, signifying their good acceptance thereof, returned us thanks, and referred the particulars thereof to a Committee of the House, yet no considerable effect was produced, nor any such progress made, as might imply their real intentions to accomplish what was petitioned for; but on the contrary, there more and more appeared amongst them an aversion to the things themselves, with much bitterness and opposition to the people of God, and his Spirit acting in them; which grew so prevalent, that those persons of Honour and Integrity amongst them who had eminently appeared for God and the Publick good, both before and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this War, were rendred of no further use in Parliament, than by meeting with a corrupt party, to give them countenance to carry on their ends, and for effecting the desire they had of perpetuating themselves in the supream Government. For which purpose, the said party long opposed, and frequently declared themselves against ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a new Representative, and when they saw themselves necessitated to take that Bill into Consideration, they resolved to make use of it to recruit the House with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the same Spirit and Temper, thereby to perpetuate their own sitting. Which Intention divers of the activest amongst them did manifest, labouring to perswade others to a consent therein: And the better to effect this, divers Petitions prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from several Counties for the continuance of this Parliament, were encouraged, if not set on foot by many of them.</p>
                                 <p>For obviating these evils, the Officers of the Army obtained several Meetings with some of the Parliament, to consider what fitting means and remedy might be applied to prevent the same: But such endeavours proving altogether ineffectual, it became most evident to the Army, as they doubt not it also is to all considering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that this Parliament, through the corruption of some, the jealousie of others, the non-attendance and negligence of many, would never answer those ends which God, his People, and the whole Nation expected from them, but that this Cause which the Lord hath so greately blessed, and bore witness to, must needs languish under their Hands, and by degrees be wholly lost, and the Lives, Liberties, and Comforts of his people delivered into their Enemies hands.</p>
                                 <p>All which being sadly and seriously considered by the honest people of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as by the Army, and Wisdome and Direction being sought from the Lord, it seemed to be a duty incumbent upon us, who had seen so much of the power and presence of God going along with us, to consider of some more effectual means to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Cause which the good people of this Commonwealth had been so long enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in, and to establish Righteousness and Peace in these Nations.</p>
                                 <p>And after much debate, it was judged necessary, and agreed upon, that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority should be by the Parliament devolved upon known persons, men fearing God, and of approved Integrity; and the Government of the Commonwealth committed unto them for a time, as the most hopeful way to encourage and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance all Gods people, reform the Law, and administer Iustice impartially, hoping thereby the people might forget <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and understanding their true Interest in the Election of successive Parliaments, may have the Government setled upon a true Basis, without hazard to this glorious Cause, or necessitating to keep up Armies for the defence of the same.</p>
                                 <p>And being still resolved to use all means possible to avoid extraordinary courses, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament to give us a Conference; with whom we freely and plainly debated the necessity and justness of our Proposals on that behalf; and did evidence that those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the <note n="*" place="margin">An Act for filling up the Parliament.</note> Act under their Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, would most probably bring forth something answerable to that Work, the foundation whereof God himself hath laid, and is now carrying on in the World.</p>
                                 <p>The which notwithstanding found no acceptance; but in stead thereof, it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that the way was to continue still this present Parliament, as being that from which we might reasonably expect all good things. And this being vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon, did much confirm us in our apprehensions, That not any love to a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative, but the making use thereof to recruit, and so to perpetuate themselves, was their aim.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="342" facs="tcp:53069:177"/>They being plainly dealt with about this, and told, that neither the Nation, the honest Interest, nor we our selves, would be deluded by such dealings; They did agree to meet again the next day in the Afternoon for mutual satisfaction; it being consented to by the Members present, that Endeavours should be used, that nothing in the mean time should be done in Parliament that might exclude or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the Proposals before-mentioned.</p>
                                 <p>Notwithstanding this, the next Morning the Parliament did make more hast than usual in carrying on their said Act, being helped on therein by some of the persons engaged to us the night before, none of them which were then present endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppose the same; and being ready to put the main Question for consummating the said Act, whereby our aforesaid Proposals would have been rendered void, and the way of bringing them into a fair and full Debate in Parliament obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                                 <p>For preventing whereof, and all the sad and evil consequences which must upon the grounds aforesaid have ensued, and whereby at one blow the Interest of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, and of this glorious Cause, had been endangered to be laid in the Dust, and these Nations embroyled in new Troubles, at a time when our Enemies abroad are watching all advantages against us, and some of them actually engaged in War with us; We have been necessitated, though with much reluctancy, to put an end to this Parliament; which yet we have done, (we hope) out of an honest heart, preferring this Cause above our Names, Lives, Families, or Interests, how dear soever; with clear intentions, and real purposes of heart, to call to the Government persons of approved fidelity and honesty; believing, that as none wise will expect to gather Grapes of Thornes, so good men will hope, that if persons so qualified be chosen, the fruits of a just and righteous Reformation, so long prayed and wished for, will (by the blessing of God) be in due time obtained, to the refreshing of all those good hearts who have been panting after these things.</p>
                                 <p>Much more might have been said, if it had been our desire to justifie our selves by aspersing others, and raking into the Mis-government of affairs; but we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this, That as we have been led by Necessity and Providence to act as we have done, even beyond and above our own thoughts and desires; so we shall and do, in that of this great Work which is behinde, put our selves wholly upon the Lord for a Blessing; professing we look not to stand one day without his support, much less to bring to pass any of the things mentioned and desired without his assistance: And therefore do solemnly desire and expect, that all men, as they would not provoke the Lord to their own destruction, should wait for such issue as he shall bring forth, and to follow their business with peaceable spirits; wherein, we promise them protection by his assistance.</p>
                                 <p>And for those who profess their fear and love to the Name of God, that seeing in a great measure, for their sakes, and for Righteousness sake, we have taken our Lives in our hand to do these things; they would be instant with the Lord day and night on our behalfs, that we may obtain Grace from him: And seeing we have made so often mention of his Name, that we may not do the least dishonour thereunto; which indeed would be our confusion, and a stain to the whole profession of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</p>
                                 <p>We beseech them also to live in all Humility, Meekness, Righteousness, and Love one towards another, and towards all men; that so they may put to silence the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Foolish, who falsly accuse them; and to know, that the late great and Glorious Dispensations, wherein the Lord hath so wonderfully appeared in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth these things, by the travel and Blood of his Children, ought to oblige them so to walk in the Wisdom and love of Christ, as may cause others to honour their holy Profession, because they see Christ to be in them of a truth.</p>
                                 <p>We do further purpose, before it be long, more particularly to shew the grounds of our Proceedings, and the Reasons of this late great Action and Change, which in this we have but hinted at.</p>
                                 <p>And we do lastly Declare, That all Iudges, Sheriffs, Iustices of Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, Committees, and all other Civil Officers, and Publick Ministers whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

They had lately received a Commission from the King, (and in Parties appeared up and down) in order to their raising new Levies, which they encreased to some competent numbers, expecting additional supplies from beyond Sea, and their Friends in the Low-lands, and some English Auxiliaries; of all which, and the Velitatory War made by them, hereafter in its place expect an Abstract and Epitome.

                           <hi>The last Dutch Engagement between Gen.</hi> Monke <hi>and</hi> Van Trump <hi>on the Coast of</hi> Holland, July 29.</note>This happened in the end of <hi>Iuly</hi>; it having been so ordered, that both the Fleets under <hi>Van Trump</hi> from the <hi>Weilings</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and <hi>De Wit</hi> from the <hi>Texel,</hi> should meet upon the Engagement: General <hi>Monke</hi> with the English Fleet lying as it were in the mid-way. On the 29 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Scouts a Head discovered this Dutch Fleet, whereupon the General made after them; but they standing away for <hi>De Wit,</hi> it was five a clock at night ere any of our Frigats got up to them, when they appeared to be 90 sail of Men of War, and ten Fire-ships: about 7 that night, General <hi>Monke</hi> (aboard the <hi>Resolution</hi>) got up
<pb facs="tcp:53069:179"/>
to them, with some 30 ships and Frigats in all, and charged through their whole Fleet; when it beginning to grow duskish, the Masters advised the General not to stand to them again that night for fear of the Fire-ships: but the noble Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral turning himself with indignation towards them, commanded them in some disgraceful, but more unproper terms, that they should <hi>To um again,</hi> for, said He, <hi>The very Powder of the Guns of this Ship is able to blow away a Fire-ship from it</hi>; and so they tackt about, and through the Dutch again: in which by a Ball from the Enemy (both Fleets being close to one another) the Mizen-shrouds of the <hi>Resolution</hi> were fired, but quickly put out again by the courageous Activity of one Captain <hi>Ioseph Taylor,</hi> then assisting and standing by the General. Nothing of more remarque was done that night, save that the <hi>Garland</hi> with the Enemy received much prejudice, being known and saluted by every ships Broad-side, though the Dutch had altered her Decks: and so the English stood to the Southward, and <hi>Van Trump</hi> to the Northward that night, and joyned with <hi>De Wit,</hi> and withal got the Weather-gage, by reason his sailing Northwards was no way suspected by our Fleet.</p>
                     <p>The next day there being much Windy and foul Weather, both Fleets could not Engage, the Sea was so high, but found it a difficult work to get off of a Lee-shore, which was so much the worse to the English, being on an Enemies Coast; but a most gallant delightful sight it was to see the two Fleets so neer one another, plying their Sails, fill'd with as much Revenge and desire of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, as with those envious Gusts that kept them asunder. But next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being Sunday, the Weather proving fair, and little Wind, <hi>Iuly</hi> 31, both Fleets Engaged again in a most terrible Fight; the Dutch animated with the equal if not the inclinable success of Friday, and the English loth to contest so long for a resolved Victory, as if three days were always to be the apportioned time of their labour in Conquest. It is impossible to give a distinct account of this Battle, in Fire and Smoak, Board and Board, for eight hours together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant. The <hi>Garland</hi> was the first disabled, and the Dutch Fire-ships notably managed their business: the <hi>Andrew, Victory, Triumph,</hi> and <hi>Rainbow,</hi> the great ships (at whom the Dutch spight was greatest) being so endangered, that out of the <hi>Triumph</hi> (which was fired by one of them) several of the ships crue threw themselves into the Sea; but others of better spirits (remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde) with great gallantry quenched the Fire, and gave a merry occasion of a Civil Law or Admiralty-Controversie, Whether the Chests, Goods, and Cloaths (which those that stayed in the ship had got on) of those that deserted it, and when the danger of the Flame was past got in again, should belong to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Possessor, who refused to d'off or re-deliver them to the former owner, who was much troubled to see other men in his Apparel. The <hi>Victory</hi> (in which was Captain <hi>Lane</hi>) was stoutly beset with a Vice-Admiral and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flemish War-ships, and so distressed, that another Dutch Vice-Admiral (in an <hi>East-India</hi>-ship of 60 Guns) coming up by her Quarter, and mistaking the Condition as well as Resolution of that Captain, proffered him Quarter, and bid him yield; which was answered with the thanks of a Broad-side, that sunk the Dutch-man immediately by his side. No less gallant service did the <hi>Speaker</hi>-Frigat, so well known to the Dutch by the name of the <hi>Prater</hi>; and truly there was nothing but the antient glory &amp; right of the English to be Superiors to that Nation, which differenced the valour of both; since had the Dutch fought upon a juster Quarrel, Fortune might have been as equal. Besides, the Death of their Admiral (the brave <hi>Van Trump</hi>) in the beginning of the Fight, by the shot of a Musquet-bullet in his left Pap,<note place="margin">Van Trump <hi>slain, and the Dutch defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> July 31.</note> mainly contributed to their Defeat: His Flag, the Original of the War, was strucken with a shot; and whether they would not, (for a signe to their Fleet to revenge his Death) or could not make it stand, there was no such Ensigne the greatest part of the Fight; which having continued from seven in the morning till one or two in the afternoon, the Dutch at last gave out and fled towards the <hi>Texel,</hi> having but one Flag standing among them, the English Frigats pursuing them; the smalness of some

Act was hammering for abolishing of Tithes, ejecting scandalous Ministers, and constituting Commissioners to go the Circuit to enquire and visit the Parishes: and most of their Debates were spent hereupon. And lastly, in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Oliver</hi>'s designe, (who yet managed and put them upon those enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Whimseys, to the making them most odious, and all Parliame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A new Council of State was now of the same teeming, but of a mightier strain; <hi>Oliver,</hi> and his Grand Officers and Partisans entirely constituting it, not a puny of those Dwarfish Politicians being admitted into the number. Those Hogens of the Council did all the business, transacted with Forrain States, kept the Wheels of Government on going here and abroad, received Embassadors, particularly the Spanish, Dutch, and French Residents, and a new one from the Great Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and other Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and put upon the Parliament all their Intrigues and ill-looked necessities of Money, so that this Convention at first dash ran the Tax up again to 120000 l. <hi>per mensem</hi> for six Months; as if <hi>Pluto</hi> kept Court there again, and that like possessed men they could speak nothing else but that and Excise, now continued, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Act for sales of Fee-farm Rents, Forrest-lands, and more Delinquents Estates, for the finishing of that whole affair.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus described the Foundation of this Stratocracy or Army-power, we shall not be obliged to any tedious survey of the superstructure, which was onely for shew, and of little duration, supported with temporary shifting Props in every emergency; for this great one rather inhabited a Labyrinth, than a Court; which shewed much variety of Art, but like a House of Cards was ready to be whelmed over his Head with every gust of adverse Fortune: a cross Restive Government he had of it, and was never able to keep it in the right Road, and true way of policy. And so we proceed in a brief account of State-Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences.</p>
                     <p>The 6 of <hi>April</hi> came forth an Ordinance settling Commissioners for Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wills, and Administrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by want of which power, there having been no settled Judge of the Prerogative-Court, (whose Name abolished the thing) very great and many inconveniencies had happened to the Nation.

Next, the Commission of the Great Seal was altered, and <hi>Whitlock, Lisle,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> were made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.

                     <p>The Scotch Affairs were reputed finished, as to any War, though the Bustle yet so held and encreased in the Highlands, that the spoils of the Conquest were now set out, and made accomptable to the Victor.

And never was such a strange mixture in the Arts of any Courtier as these Times beheld, much like the mysteries of the as strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed and tempered Government. With much impatience did all men indeed await the issue of this grand Affair; and to be certain, the Hours could not be less tedious to them, to whom belonged the approaching Golden Age: but <hi>Parturiunt montes,</hi> — The following abstract will admonish the great ones, that Fortune is not to be over-tempted; and that without the Concurrence of good Deliberation, Conduct, and Valour, she is not always obliged to her Favourites.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed: during the abode of the Fleet at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the Generals, Colonels, and inferiour Officers were not negligent in their several stations. General <hi>Pen</hi> caused the Carpenters of each ship to set up those Shallops which were brought over in quarters out of <hi>England</hi>; and ordered the Coopers to trim and fit Water-Casks: Besides, he sent two Frigats to St. <hi>Christophers</hi> and <hi>Mevis,</hi> for raising of Voluntiers there. In the mean time, General <hi>Venables</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a new Regiment of Seamen to serve upon occasion at Land; these were put under the conduct of Vice-Admiral <hi>Goodson</hi>; the rest of the Regiments brought out of <hi>England,</hi> were easily compleated to a full number; likewise a Troop of gallant Horse were raised by the Islanders,<note place="margin">Hispaniola <hi>and</hi> Jamaica <hi>Expidition.</hi>

But these were not all the strength; for the Planters Servants understanding that if they would serve the State, their time should still go on, and that at last (in spight of their Masters) they should enjoy their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in as ample a manner as if they had served them; this spurred them on to become Souldiers of Fortune; and many were presently listed into several Regiments accordingly. The Fleet was also augmented by twenty sail of Dutch Vessels, which were made prize for presuming to traffique with Prohibited Goods, contrary to the Articles of Peace betwixt the two Nations. The Land-Army being now in readiness, their number was found to be so great, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ships share was as many as it could carry. <hi>March</hi> 31 they set Sail from <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi> and in six days after came by the Lee under St. <hi>Christophers</hi>: Here joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them about 1300 more, which came off from several Islands, in hopes to be made for ever: from hence they shaped their course directly for <hi>Hispani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola.</hi>

On the 13 of <hi>April,</hi> the whole Navy came fair by the Island, and plainly discovered the sown of <hi>Sancta Domingo</hi>: Immediately hereupon a Council was called, and the Guides consulted withal: here it was concluded that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Venables</hi> should to Land. According to which resolution, the next day he landed about ten Leagues to the West-ward of the Town, with 7000 Foot, a Troop of Horse, and three days Provision of Victuals. No sooner were they landed, but every mans Tongue was tipt with Gold; nothing could be thought on, but the plunder of Plate and Jewels; small things could not enter their minds: as for Hangings, Housholdstuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they would be cumbersome to carry; and therefore they resolved to leave such things behinde them. In this extasie of joy was the Souldiery; when behold, upon a sudden there appeared a Proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>amation from the General, commanding, that when they entred the Town of <hi>Sancta Domingo,</hi> no man should plunder either Money, Plate, or Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, neither kill any tame Cattle, on pain of Death. This made the Army look Sower on their imaginary Sweetness; their Golden Hearts were now turned to Leaden Heels; so that it was indifferent to them, whether they went farther, or tarried there: yet for all this, on they marched through Woods of incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thickness, meeting no Enemy, except the excessive heat of the Sun, which caused an intolerable drought, that oppressed them sorely, having not had one drop of Water in many miles march, but what they carried in their own Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; so that Urine was as White-wine to them that could swallow it.</p>
                     <p>General <hi>Pen,</hi> after the landing of these men, set ashore three Regiments more, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Buller,</hi> in a Bay where a fair Fresh-water-River disburdened it self; this was within two Leagues of the Town, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the place for conjunction of the whole Army. It was not long before the General, (according to the appointment) having peaceably past the Woods, came to the River, and joyned himself with <hi>Buller</hi>'s Brigade. Here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on view, the Army was sound to be 9700 (but few fighting) men. From this River the Army hasted away to take possession of the Town, which in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was already won: there marched on before the rest, a Forlorn Hope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 500 men; afterward followed the main Body of the Army. In this order they marched within four miles of the Town, when on the sudden, a small party of Spaniards encountered the Forlorn Hope,<note place="margin">

On the English side was slain Captain <hi>Cox,</hi> the chief Guide for the place, and many others.</p>
                     <p>The General having now seen the imbecility of his men, through want of Water and many other necessaries, he caused them to march back again to the River, from whence they came to refresh themselves, in order to a full prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the designe in hand.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>They Rally.</hi>
                        </note> To which end, Scaling-Ladders were made, and two small Drakes mounted, with a Morter-piece and Granado-shells, which were landed from the Fleet: these were conveyed by Water to be set on shore at a convenient place neer the Fort.</p>
                     <p>All things being now in readiness, to try conclusions, the Army once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain dislodged, and were by the Guides promised to be brought upon the Town of St <hi>Domingo</hi> by a private way, where they might pass thorough the Woods free from any Fort. Such a way there certainly was; but these blinde Guides taking another to be it, the whole Army were brought neer to the place where before they had been shamefully repulsed. The Spaniards in the mean time having certain intelligence by <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Molattoes</hi> of the English march, prepared to entertain them in their passage. <hi>April</hi> 25, 1655. the whole Army approached near to a Fort which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had in the Wood, built of Brick, in a triangular form, without Flankers: in it were nine pieces of good Ordnance, and 300 resolute fellows to manage them. The English Army, a little before noon, approaching neer this Fort, were upon the sudden charged
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53069:191"/>
by a party of the Enemy that lay undiscovered among the Trees. These resolute Spaniards, being about seventy in number, at first fired a round Volley of small shot upon the Forlorn Hope, and then flew in like mad-men with their sharp Steel-Lances upon the English, (who were already even suffocated with Thirst, and hardly able to stand, much less to fight) so that in a moment the General's running-Regiment,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>And are again Defeated by the Spaniards.</hi>
                        </note> with half the Army, flew back to the Rear, and possest their fellows there with such a Pannick fear, that every one began to shift for himself. Mean while the Spaniards pursued the Victory with the greatest slaughter they were able to make: for meeting with no resistance, (but what that ever-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Gentleman Major-General <hi>Hayns</hi> was able to make with twelve men, (whom he engaged by the honour of their Country) one whereof was Ensigne <hi>Boys,</hi> who died not unrevenged in the midst of their Enemies) they wreaked their fury at pleasure on these frighted men; till at last, being overcome with killing, they retreated back in Triumph with seven English Colours, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Trophies of their Victory. The retreat of the Enemy gave opportunity for the Living to number the Dead. Upon view, it was found that 600 were slain outright, 300 Wounded, (most in their backs) and besides 200 more crept into Bushes, and ran away to save themselves; which afterward were knockt on the head by <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Molattoes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this sad disaster, the Army that night drew up nearer the Spanish Fort, as if they intended some mighty matters; and having planted a Morter-piece in a convenient plot of ground, and all things being ready to do Execution on the Fort; upon a sudden the Souldiers were ordered to draw off: So the Army without doing any thing marched away to their old Watering-place in the Bay. To what intent and purpose this was, could never yet be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>The Army being come into the Bay, had not that supply of Victuals from the ships as formerly, but were necessitated by parties to go into the Woods to catch Cattle, which many times cost them dear: for the <hi>Negroes</hi> instead of hunting Cows, would oftentimes change their Game, and breathe them back again to their Quarters.</p>
                     <p>These things brought the Army to such distress, that (fearing to fight for Food abroad) they exercised their Valour at home upon the Troop-horses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their own Army. Thus did they continue for some days, till a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution was taken to Imbarque them, and with all speed to make for <hi>Iamaica. May</hi> the third day, (all the remaining part of the Army being shipped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least disturbance from the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) the Fleet set sail for the aforesaid Island.</p>
                     <p>This disastrous defeat was rightly imputable to these foregoing causes;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Considerations of this defeat.</hi>
                        </note> but there were others also, as namely the Discipline, or rather the Licentiousness and Debauchery of those Auxiliary-Islanders; a crue of such dissolute Fellows, that were fitter to work and slave in the Mines, than to fight for the Gold. But they did not alone frustrate the assured hopes of Victory, (for it is supposed they were not listed but for number, and to make Drudges) but made the defeat far more miserable, by eating up the Provisions designed for the Army, who were set on shore very weak and feeble, at so strange and unreasonable distance, when the advice was they should have landed at the Bay of <hi>Domingo,</hi> while the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was in his Cups, and the Town overflowed with Drink and Gladness for the arrival of their Fleet thither, they supposing this <hi>Armada</hi> of ours to be their own about that time expected. There was such a complication of errours and misfortunes, through the insufficiency and ill Conduct of the General, to say no worse, and the faintness of the Souldier, caused by the carelessness of their Friends, who should better have Provisioned them, and the terrour of their Enemies, besides the scorching heat of the Sand, which made it painful to stand or go, that hardly any Expedition in History can parallel it; for they were beaten in a manner without a Blow.</p>
                     <p>Yet these miseries were not at an end; it was not yet easily resolvable what
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53069:192"/>
should be done with this frighted and pestering multitude; for all the Victual was spent, and it was impossible to turn to Windward with such a company and so little sustenance: and some thoughts there were of abandoning this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent wretched Crue, and return to the <hi>Barbadoes</hi>; but it was their kinde and undeserved fate that proposed the Island of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> whither on the 3 of <hi>May</hi> they directed their course, and without any opposition Landed; there being a resolution made by the Council of War, (to prevent the like Cowardise) that if any man turned his back to the Enemy, his Bringer-up should kill him. The Spaniards having no intelligence of the late overthrow at <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> nor indeed suspecting any Hostility, fled away at the approach of this formidable Army, and withdrew their Goods; their pretended Governour staving off the English with a Treaty, while all was conveyed away into the Woods, whither parties were sent, to follow and to kill Cattle for the Army, of which they found very good, and good store, without any fighting: which no doubt was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and gave them time to recover their Spirits; so that afterwards they dreaded not a <hi>Molatto,</hi> as they lighted upon them in parties in those Forrests of Cedar, and other excellent Physical and useful Trees; where for a while we leave them.</p>
                     <p>At home another <hi>Portugal</hi> Embassador arrived, and brought a Ratification of the Treaty; that King having consented to the Damages adjusted in one of the Articles thereof.

In short, there was nothing which they might not do, nor which they did not; such an Arbitrary vast power they had from the Protector. To this purpose a Fast was kept by the charitable Gentlemen, and an Office was erected here in <hi>London,</hi> called the Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals-Office, somewhere in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> as other Courts had, where these Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances were entred, and all other the like Affairs, Dependencies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thereof entred and Recorded. By this means the Tyrant intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himself of the value and quality of every Estate and Person, together with the number of that Party in every County throughout the Kingdom. Most of

those Loyal persons formerly secured, were hereupon set at Liberty; but by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother twenty-mile-Proclamation driven into the Country, into the bounds of the several Major-Generals, who presently took Cognizance of them, and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them to their respective Residences: they sate sometimes without, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times with some of the old Committees, where they received accounts of Estates, which were rated to the tenth peny yearly. Some bought off that Tax and incumbrance by a present Sum, at three years purchase; which was very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, for Money was the thing the Usurper wanted: others looked for a nearer Redemption, and to be constrained to that payment. The well-affected and Godly people still voiced this to be a just and reasonable Imposition; for when should they be at quiet, and enjoy themselves in the Goods they had got, free from the interrupting endeavour of this old and restless Enemy? so that there wanted not Abettors and Assistants to this most Religious work of the Major-Generals; who had ordered in the first place, that no Royalist should keep or wear either Arms offensive or defensive,<note place="margin">

                        </note> hoping so to awe the Elections, (having had time to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that power he had assumed to himself) together with the disappointment the late Parliament had met with, and the desire of Settlement (which the new acquired Wealth and Estates, by the vast purchases of Crown and other Lands vehemently enforced; together with the severe penalties on Royalists Electing and Elected, and the flagging wearied opposition of striving thus in vain against his uncontroulable will) would so propitiate his designes in this Convention, that under the pretence of the said Settlement, he might establish himself, and obtain supplies for carrying on the said War. He set up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-Generals, to force themselves into the peoples trust and abhorence together: for as the mad actions of the Little Parliament were on purpose suffered and dictated to them, to make the people chuse any Government rather, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a Single Person upon his own score: So these Major-Generals tyrannical

                     <p>These were his aims upon this Convention; for suffrages wherein, his party, and all that he could make to his side, were no less sedulous and industrious; and if they failed in the major voice, he could but use the same trick of Seclusion.

                     <p>THe sutable political talk of the party of the Usurper, was now engaged in strained arguments for a Monarchy in the person of this their Ring-leader; and this Maxime was broacht in the News-book, That there was no everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting principle in Government as to any particular Form; That Government is but a temporary expedient; that it is like <hi>Vltima tabula post naufragium,</hi> in the hazard of the Commonwealth, the next shift may be made use of. The same was the inspired reason into the Humble Petition and Advice; which after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Debates and Resolutions, was drawn into that Consistency; the main whereof, was to desire the Protector to change that Title for the other of King. On the 9 of <hi>April,</hi> the Parliament having desired a meeting with him, came to the Banquetting-house in <hi>White-hall,</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> in a Speech commended the Title and Office of a King,<note place="margin">

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53069:199"/>
many hundred years, and from the safety and honour of his own person: to all which they were answered from a mixt result of ambition and anger, till the deliberated certainty of the latter had crusht the Airy conceit of the other. The danger and his scruples consisted in these Objections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, That the Title of King is a name of Office, which any name that may imply the Supreme Magistrate hath the same signification, and therefore no necessity of change.</hi> Answer, that the Name of a King is onely adequate to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of the Office of the Supreme Magistrate. It is a Rule, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> cannot alter the Laws, by reason of their Name; and that there is no obligation upon any other. That the very Title was declared necessary in 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. in the controversie betwixt him and <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. every action done by the King in possession was valid, for it was his Jurisdiction Royal: so in <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. the same of a King <hi>de Facto.</hi> That there is a <hi>prius</hi> a former, and <hi>primum</hi> a first; the Name King had beginning with our Laws: that for Protector there must be a new Law introductive of such a Title.</p>
                     <p>The other Objections of danger, namely, <hi>The difficulty in altering the same Government to a Commonwealth, and the refusal of some Iudges, and actings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon that ground; that another Parliament might change those Resolutions; the dislike of the good people, and the bent of the Army; that Providence had laid aside this Title of the King after seven years War, and many of the chief of those instruments dissatisfied</hi> (of which presently) were answered with his own Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of Providence, which would (was bound, they would have said) to wait upon these beloved and glorious necessities: and that as to Dissatisfied Persons, there never was any the most just and happy Government free from them. But because the most material part and effect of our Civil-War came to <hi>Entitle it self</hi> to this grand Event, it will be very just and equal to shew it in its full proportion, and in its genuine sense, from the Mouths of the then Lord <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself. I omit to acquaint the Reader at large with the Protector's Jealousie, that they would fortifie his Title, and dis-enable his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; for he demanded no less security to his Greatness, than 190000 l. a year, and the charge of the Spanish War besides.</p>

                                    <hi>I</hi> Have very little to trouble your Highness with;<note place="margin">The Ld. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s Speech to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</note> so much hath been already spoken, and so well, that it will be hard for me or any other to undertake to adde to it: onely the duty of my Employment, and something due to your Highness, occasions me to speak a few words, to acknowledge with very humble thanks the Honour and Right which you have done this Committee, by the clear and free Discourses and Conferences which they have had with your Highness; and for your frequent Expressions and Testimonies of affection and respect to the Parliament, whose sense in this I may presume to speak, that never any persons met their Supreme Magistrate with more Love, Duty, and Honour, than the Parliament have met your Highness with, in their present Addresses; which argument of love deserves the esteem and force, which I doubt not but your Highness will put upon it. I am fearful to be too tedious at any time, especially at so late an hour, and therefore shall speak but short, to some things which I remember not to have been mentioned. Your Highness was pleased at the last meeting, to say, that the Original Institution of the Title King, was by common consent, and that the same common consent might institute any other Title, and make it as effectual as that of King. This must be acknowledged; but withal you may be pleased to observe, that the Title of King is not onely by an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal common consent, but that consent also approved and confirmed, and the Law fitted thereunto, and that fitted to the Laws, by the experience and industry of many ages, and many hundreds of years together; whereas any other Title will be onely by present common consent, without that experience and approbation: for that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53069:200"/>
experience which your Highness mentioned to have been of other Titles, and the due administration of Iustice under them: this experience is far short of the other; and for the course of Iustice, we have cause to thank that care which plac'd so good Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Officers over us; yet give me leave to say, that in private Causes between party and party; and in publick matters in nominal causes, it was not easie to finde justice to be done by some Iurors: and many questions have risen upon the occasion of those new Titles, concerning that tender point of good mens satisfaction. I think it requires a very great regard from us, and I doubt not but those good People will be fully satisfied, if they consider the Covenants, Promises, and Precepts, which in the Scriptures are annex'd to the Name of King: and although some have alledged, that they belong to any chief Magistrate as well as to King; yet no man did ever read the Original word translated otherwise than King, neither do I finde the present Title once mentioned in the Holy Text. If the present Authority be a lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which I hope none of us will deny; surely those good men, who are so well-principled in Godliness, will not forget that precept of submission to Authority, and to be satisfied with that which Lawful Authority shall ordain. Their Rights and Liberties are the same with ours, and the Parliament cannot advise any thing for the preservation of the Peoples Rights, but these good men are included; which I hope will be no dissatisfaction to them. In all the changes which we have seen, there hath been a dissatisfaction to some; yet still the Blessing of God hath gone along through all these Changes, with those who carried on his interest; and the Cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, the same Mercies have been continued: And I doubt not but if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Change, or rather Restitution be made, (as I hope it will) the same God will continue his Blessings to that Good Old Cause wherein we are engaged; and that good men will receive satisfaction by it. Your Highness hath been told, that the Title of King is upon the Foundation of Law, and that a new Title must have a constitution to make the Laws relate unto it, and that unto the Laws. I shall onely adde this, that a Title by relation is not so certain and safe, as a Title upon the old Foundation of the Law; and that a Title upon a present single Constitution (as any new Title must be) cannot be so firm, as a Title both upon the present Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and upon the old Foundation of the Law likewise, which the Title of King will be. If any inconvenience should ensue upon your acceptance of this Title which the Parliament adviseth, your Highness satisfaction will be, that they did advise it.</p>
                                 <p>On the contrary part, if any inconvenience should arise upon your Highness refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of this Title which the Parliament hath advised, your burden will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore whatsoever may fall out, will be better answered by your Highness complying with your Parliament, than otherwise. This question is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together new; some instances have been given of the like, to which I shall adde two or three. The Title of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was Lord of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Parliament in the <hi>33</hi> year of <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> reciting, that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies did arise there by reason of that Title, did Enact that <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>King of Ireland,</hi> which in the Iudgement of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was preferred before the other. In the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> new Titles proved fatal to their Liberties.</p>
                                 <p>Their case was not much unlike ours; they were wearied with a Civil War, and coming to a Settlement, <hi>Cuncta discordiis civilibus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

of the Civil Rights of that people, which have continued in a prosperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ever since unto this day.

                                    <hi>I</hi> Come hither to answer that that was in your last Paper to your Committee you sent to me,<note place="margin">The Protector's Speech to the Parliament concerning the Title of King.</note> which was in relation to the desires which were offered to me by the House, in that they called their Petition. I confess that business hath put the House, the Parliament, to a great deal of trouble, and spent much time: I am very sorry that it hath cost me some, and some thoughts; and because I have been the unhappy occasion of the expence of so much time, I shall spend little of it now: I have the best I can revolved the whole business in my thoughts <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I have said so much already in testimony of the whole, that I think I shall not need to repeat any thing that I have said. I think it is a Government, that the aims of it seek much a setling the Nation on a good foot in relation to Civil Rights and Liberties, which are the Rights of the Nation; and I hope I shall never be found to be of them that shall go about to Rob the Nation of these Rights, but to serve them what I can to the attaining of them. It hath also exceeding well provided for the safety and security of honest men, in that great Natural and Religious Liberty, which is Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conscience: These are great Fundamentals, and I must bear my testimony to them, (as I have and shall do still, so long as God lets me live in this World) that the intentions of the things are very honourable and honest, and the Product worthy of a Parliament. I have onely had the unhappiness both in my Conferences with your Committees, and in the best thoughts I could take to my self, not to be convicted of the necessity of that thing, that hath been so often insisted upon by you, to wit, the Title of <hi>King,</hi> as in it self so necessary, as it seems to be apprehended by your selves: and I do with all honour and respect to the judgment of the Parliament, testifie, that (<hi>caeteris patibus</hi>) no private judgement is to lye in the Ballance with the judgement of a Parliament; but in things that respect particular persons, every man that is to give an account to God of his actions, he must in some measure be able to prove his own Work, that is, to have an approbation in his own Conscience of that he is to do or forbear; and whilst you are granting others Liberties, surely you will not deny me this, it being not onely a liberty, but a duty (and such a duty as I cannot without sinning forbear) to examine my own Heart, and thoughts, and judgement, in every work which I am to set mine Hand to, or to appear in or for.</p>
                                 <p>I must confess therefore, that though I do acknowledge all the other, yet I must be a little confident in this, that what with the circumstances that accompany Humane Actions, whether they be circumstances of time or persons, whether circumstances that relate to the whole, or private or particular circumstances, that compass any person that is to render an account of his own actions: I have truely thought, and do still think, that if I should (at the best) do any thing on this account to answer your expectation, it would be at the best doubtingly; and certainly what is so, is not of faith; whatsoever is not of faith, is sin to him that doth it, whether it be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the substance of the action about which the consideration is conversant, or whether to circumstances about it, which make all indifferent actions good or evil to him that doth it. I lying under this consideration, think it my duty; onely I could have wished I had done it sooner, for the sake of the House, who have laid so infinite obligations on me: I wish also I had done it sooner for your sake, for saving time and trouble; and indeed for the Committees sake, to whom I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge publickly, I have been unseasonably troublesome: I say, I could have wished I had given it sooner; but truely this is my Answer, that although I think the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53069:201"/>
doth consist of very excellent parts in all, but in that one thing the Title: as to me, I should not be an honest man, if I should not tell you, that I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Government, nor undertake the trouble and charge of it, which I have a litle more experimented than every man, as to what troubles and difficulties do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal men under such Trusts, and in such undertakings; I say, I am perswaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this Answer to you, <hi>That I cannot undertake this Government with the Title of a</hi> King; <hi>and that is mine Answer to this great and weighty business.</hi>

He lying upon the Spanish Coast, had intelligence given him that the <hi>West-India</hi>-Fleet were arrived at the <hi>Canary</hi>-Islands, and put into the Bay of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> on the Island of <hi>Teneriff.</hi> Upon this the Fleet weighed Anchor on the 13 of <hi>April</hi> 1657. and by the 20 of the same Month, were fair in the <hi>Offing</hi> of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> where they discovered how bravely the Spanish ships (sixteen in number) were barricado'd in this Bay, where they lay in a manner Semi-circular. Neer to the Mouth of this Haven, stands a Castle sufficiently furnished with great Ordnance, which threatned destruction to any that durst enter without its leave into the Harbour: besides this, there stood seven Forts more round about the Bay, with six, four, and three great Guns apiece; and united together by a Line of Communication from one Fort to another, which was manned with Musqueteers. To make all safe, <hi>Don Diego Diagues</hi> General of the Spanish Fleet was not idle in making Provision for the best defence of his Armado: he caused all the smaller ships to be mored close along the shore, and the six Great Galleons stood farther out at Anchor, with their Broad-sides towards the Sea. It happened at this time, there was a Dutch Merchants ship in the Bay; the Master whereof seeing the English ready to enter, and that a Combat would presently be commenced, it made him fear that among all the Blows that would be given, he could not avoid some knocks; therefore to save himself, he went to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and desired his leave to depart the Harbour: For (said he) <hi>I am very sure</hi> Blake <hi>will presently be amongst you.</hi> To this, the resolute <hi>Don</hi> made no other reply, but, <hi>Get you gone if you will, and let</hi> Blake <hi>come if he dares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They that knew <hi>Blake</hi>'s Courage, could not but know it needless to dare him to an Engagement. All things being ordered for fight, a Squadron of ships was drawn out of the whole Fleet to make the first onset; these were Commanded by Captain <hi>Stainer</hi> in the <hi>Speaker</hi>-Frigat, who no sooner had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders, but immediately he flew into the Bay with his Canvas Wings, and by eight in the Morning fell pell-mell upon the Spanish Fleet,<note place="margin">Sancta Cruz <hi>fight,</hi> Apr. 20.</note> without the least regard to the Forts, that spent their shot prodigally upon him. No soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were these entered into the Bay, but <hi>Blake</hi> following after, placed certain ships to pour Broad-sides into the Castle and Forts: these played their parts so well, that after some time the Spaniards found their Forts too hot to be held. In the mean time <hi>Blake</hi> strikes in with <hi>Stainer,</hi> and bravely fought the Spanish ships, which were not much inferiour in number to the English, but in Men they were far the superiour. Here we see a resolute bravery many times may carry the day, and make number lie by the Lee: this was manifest; for by two of the clock in the afternoon, the English had beaten their Enemies out of their ships.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Blake</hi> seeing an impossibility of carrying them away,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Spanish Fleet fired.</hi>
                        </note> he ordered his men to fire their Prizes; which was done so effectually, that all the Spanish Fleet were reduced to Ashes, except two ships that sunk downright, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of them above water but some part of their Masts.</p>
                     <p>The English having now got a compleat Victory,<note place="margin">

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53069:202"/>
getting out again. But Gods Providence was miraculously seen, in causing the Wind upon the sudden to Vere about to the South-West, (a thing not known in many years before) which brought <hi>Blake</hi> and his Fleet safe to Sea again, notwithstanding the Spaniards from the Castle played their Great Guns perpetually upon them as they passed by. The Wind, as it proved a Friend to bring the English forth, so it continued to carry them back again to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer station near to <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This noble Service made <hi>Blake</hi> as terrible as <hi>Drake</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; there being less difference betwixt the Fame and report of their Actions and Exploits, than in the sound of their Names; and it was accordingly resented here by all parties. <hi>Cromwel</hi> (whom it most concerned) sent his Secretary to acquaint the House with the particulars,<note place="margin">

For his part, nothing would have induced him to take this unsupportable Burthen to Flesh and Blood, but that he had seen in the Parliament a great care in doing those things which might really answer the ends that were engaged for, and make clearly for the Liberty of the Nations, and for the Interest and Preservation of all such as fear God under various Forms.

First went his Gentlemen, then a Herald; next the Aldermen, another Herald, the Attorney-General, then the Judges, (of whom Serjeant <hi>Hill</hi> was one, being made a Baron of the Exchequer <hi>Iune</hi> 16.) then <hi>Norroy,</hi> the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and the Seal carried by Commissioner <hi>Fiennes</hi>; then <hi>Garter,</hi> and after him the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> with the Sword born before the Protector Bare-headed, the Lord Mayor <hi>Titchborn</hi> carrying the City-Sword (by the special Coaks of the Protector) by his left Hand.

                           </note>1. The Robe of Purple, <hi>this is an Emblem of Magistracy and imports Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Iustice. When you have put on this Vestment, I may say you are a Gown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This</hi> Robe <hi>is of a mixt colour, to shew the mixture of Iustice and Mercy. Indeed, a Magistrate must have two bands,</hi> Plectentem &amp; amplectentem, <hi>to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and to punish.</hi>

                        <item>2. The Bible <hi>is a Book that contains the Holy Scriptures, in which you have the happiness to be well vers'd. This Book of Life consists of two Testaments, the Old and New: the first shews</hi> Christum Velatum, <hi>the second</hi> Christum Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; <hi>Christ Vailed and Revealed: it is a Book of Books, and doth contain both Precepts and Examples for good Government.</hi>

                        <item>3. <hi>Here is a</hi> Scepter, <hi>not unlike a Staff; for you are to be a Staff to the Weak and Poor: it is of antient use in this kinde. It's said in Scripture, that</hi> the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall not depart from <hi>Iudah. It was of the like use in other Kingdoms</hi>; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>the Greek Poet calls Kings and Princes</hi> Scepter-bearers.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>The last thing is a</hi> Sword, <hi>not a Military but Civil Sword, it is a Sword rather of defence than offence; not to defend your self onely, but your People also. If I might presume to fix a Motto upon this Sword, as the Valiant Lord</hi> Talbot <hi>had upon his, it should be this,</hi> Ego sum Domini Protectoris, ad protegendum popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum meum, <hi>I am the Protector, to protect my People.</hi>

                     <p>This Speech being ended, the Speaker took the Bible and gave the Protector his Oath: afterwards Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> made a Prayer, wherein he recommended the Protector, Parliament, Council, the Forces by Land and Sea, Government, and People of the three Nations, to the protection of God. Which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Heralds by sound of Trumpet Proclaimed his Highness Protector of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions thereunto belonging; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all persons to yield him due obedience.

the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> his Eldest son, returned in the same posture, the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> sitting at one end of the Coach against him; <hi>Richard</hi> his son and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> in one, and Lord <hi>Lisle</hi> and <hi>Montague</hi> in the other Boot, with swords drawn, and the Lord <hi>Claypool</hi> Master of the Horse led the Horse of Honour in rich Caparisons to <hi>White-hall.</hi> The Members to the Parliament-house, where they Prorogued their sitting to the twentieth of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>

                     <p>Great Rhodomontadoes of Proclaimings, and little less than Blasphemy in the several Addresses in and from all parts of the three Kingdoms, were the vapouring and ranting conclusions of this story<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which reduceth to memory another terrible occurrence to the Protector, amidst those ambages and suspence of a Crown, namely a Book published under the Title of <hi>Killing no Murther,</hi>

                        </note> where nothing but Water could be discovered. Other accidents of Murther and Slaughter there were: one <hi>Butler,</hi> a Comrade and Companion of one <hi>Knight</hi>'s, Servant to one <hi>Worth</hi> a Silk-man, then upon his affairs at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi> being tempted with the sight of the Money, which lying with this <hi>Knight</hi> in his Masters absence he had opportunity to observe, cut his Friends Throat after some strugling, and escaped with the Money; but was most providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially discovered. One <hi>Parsons</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel to <hi>Pride,</hi> being set upon in the Highway for his Purse, and making resistance, was shot, for all the care of his Comrades the Major-Generals, whose Authority now began to wain. But that which is most remarkable of these occurrences and casualties, was the Execution of Captain <hi>Bernard,</hi> for Robbing the House of his Colonel <hi>Winthrop,</hi> Colonel in <hi>Harrison</hi>'s place and Regiment,<note place="margin">Bernards <hi>that betrayed Col.</hi> Andrews <hi>Hanged for Robbery.</hi>

He made applications to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and alledged his past, and proffered great future service for a Reprieve; but even <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself thought not such a fellow fit to live; besides, he was infamous, and too well known; and he had new ones of greater abilities retained to that purpose, no way in the world suspicable of such practises, namely one <hi>Corker</hi> a Minister formerly in <hi>York-shire,</hi> but a violent and Active Royalist in the War, and one that had a hand in that Exploit of killing of <hi>Rainsborough</hi>; and a Knight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Governour of <hi>Newark,</hi> far more eminent in the Royal service; of which presently.</p>
                     <p>The Forrain adjunct transactions, were first the <hi>Danish</hi> War with the <hi>Swede,</hi> then engaged in a far distant War with the almost-subdued <hi>Pole.</hi> The reason of this suddain Rupture, was the like Invasion made by the <hi>Swede</hi> some thirteen years before, and wresting by his Arms some Provinces from that Kingdom, of which now this occasion offered them the recovery; however it answered not its promising beginnings.</p>

                     <p>The taking of <hi>Mardike</hi> was very grievous to the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> and Spanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and therefore it was resolved by <hi>Don Iohn</hi> to hazard a <hi>Scalado</hi> and Assault by night: The illustrious Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the Marquess of <hi>Caracene</hi> ordered and were present in the business; and the King our Soveraign, and the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> had conveyed themselves to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to see the management of this attempt. On the 22 of <hi>October</hi> at night, some 4000 English, Scotch and Irish,<note place="margin">Mardike <hi>Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by night,</hi> Octo. 22.</note> and some Spaniards, about ten a clock at night began the Storm with Hand-Granadoes, and all sorts of Assaulting Engines, and were got into the Trenches, and mounted their Scaling-ladders; but the English within being in a readiness, and <hi>Reynolds, Morgan,</hi> and <hi>Lillingstone,</hi> being at that same time there, the Assailants were with great slaughter repelled and beaten down; the Great Guns from the English Fleet (riding at the <hi>Splinter</hi>) firing their Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, being directed by four great Links (set up in the Corners of the Fort) how to miss it: nevertheless, about four a clock the Duke commanded the Assault to be renewed again; which was done with greater fury, but to as little advantage; which event with the approaching day-light caused a retreat, the Dead being most of them carried off in Waggons. There were some hundreds guessed to be slain, but the number is uncertain.</p>
                     <p>This was a rude accost and greeting of Country-men, which used to be the most obliging in Forrain Countries; but Rebellion is a Witch (as they are compared with a pejoration of the former in Scripture) that had transformed the Military part of the Nation. Often have we fought on both sides, but were
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53069:204"/>
never opposed in any Battle one against another, much less to fight an home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred quarrel of our own in Out-landish ground. The Noble Duke therefore thinking the Hearts of the Leaders of this Garrison, if they had any true Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Worth or Honour suitable to their Commands, might be touched with the unnaturalness of the Fact, and a sense of their Allegiance, and respect to their Rightful Soveraign, and himself the next Prince of the Blood, (against whom they indirectly and collaterally militated) as being now out of the Reach, Influence, and Awe of the Usurper, sought therefore by fair means to win this Party, which would highly and sufficiently conduce to his Majesties Service, to their obedience. In order to this, by the means of a Scotch Knight (whose Name slips our present use) well acquainted with Colonel <hi>Reynolds,</hi> he was prevailed upon to give the Duke a meeting in the mid-way betwixt <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike,</hi> which are distant about two miles, with a party of Horse on either side. <hi>Reynolds</hi> at the approach of the Duke did the reverence which was redevable to his Highness, and shewed himself in all respects as became him towards such an Illustrious Personage, and with the same handsome demeanour departed to the Fort. What conference they had was never perfectly related, for it was private; but the very news of the meeting in that amicable respectful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, being conveyed with speed to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> caused in him such jealousies and distrusts, that inflamed with anger at this his great Confident and Favourite, he presently dispatcht away a Messenger to Command him for <hi>London</hi>; which he, and Colonel <hi>White,</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Devaux</hi> the Secretary to <hi>Reynolds,</hi> readily obeying, and taking the first ship was ready, and that would venture to go off; (which was a Dutch Pink of 10 Guns, in a stormy night the 12 of <hi>December,</hi> a Frigat offering to wait on him next Morning) he was cast away the same night on the back of the <hi>Goodwyn-sands,</hi>

Here Marshal <hi>D' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> was furnished with some ships of ours for a designe upon <hi>Ostend,</hi> which he had thought he had surely purchased: but of this hereafter.</p>
                     <p>As to other Forrain News, there was great discourse about the right to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariat or Vicarship of the Empire, which now happened by the Death of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 4 of <hi>Austria,</hi> his Son the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> being dead some while before. It did indisputably belong to the Prince Elector <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi>; but upon the quarrel for the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he was proscribed and degraded, and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> (a descendant of the younger House) did now assert and maintain that right, as lately confirmed on him by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour against the <hi>Palatine</hi>; and so it remained <hi>sub judice.</hi>

                     <p>The chief Actors being thus secured, <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to Collogue with the City, sent for the Mayor and Aldermen, and communicated to them the Plot, naming several persons and particulars, many of which he accommodated to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the City, and dressed them for their horrour and resentment, telling them that the danger was not over, though so happily foreseen; taking hereby the advantage of having a new Militia chosen of the most desperate Phanaticks, and his party in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. A general Train was soon after made in <hi>Finsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>-fields, and Addresses by the Officers, testifying their resolutions to adhere to the Protector, delivered in very express and humouring Language.

In the mean time, the Spanish Ports, <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Ostend,</hi> could expect no less than to be perpetually infested by Men of War; which would utterly spoil their Trade,<note place="margin">Don John <hi>of</hi> Austria <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes to relieve</hi> Dunkirk.</note> and ruine the Inhabitants. These and such<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like considerations, mounted <hi>Don Iohn</hi> upon fixt resolutions to undertake the Relief of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> though it were to the hazard of his whole Army.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, the Confederate Forces Beleaguering this strong place, did in a small time (working like Moles) run their Trenches to the Spanish Counterscarp; and still encroaching upon the Wall, they promised fair to a speedy accomplishment of their Designe. These things were well known to the Spanish Army, who now saw the Relief of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> would admit of no delay; for were it not speedily accomplished, the Town of necessity must lie prostrate to the Enemies mercy. The better to effect which therefore, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> the Spanish General, having drained his Garrisons to fill up his Army, suddenly advanced with 15000 men to the relief of his distressed Friends; these by a swift march through <hi>Fuernes,</hi> quickly seated themselves upon some sandy Hills, within an English mile and a half of <hi>Turenne</hi> the French General's Camp.</p>
                     <p>The report of the Enemies neer advance, made both the French and English Officers consult upon the best course that could be taken to repel the Force that now sate upon their Skirts, and endeavoured to frustrate their labours in the present Siege, if no worse success. Time for consultation being short, (for it was on the over-night) they agreed unamimously to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the next morning a warm Breakfast. All this night the Officers of both Nations were very busie to provide for the ensuing action; the Army being found suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to fight a Field-battle, and at the same time to keep the Besieged from ranging abroad. For this service most of the English were drawn from their Entrenchment; and being joyned to the French Horse, they marched against the Enemy. In the morning (both Armies being come near together) it was perceived, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> posture was rather Defensive than Offensive; but the English Commanders knowing it was no time to dally, and being desirous withal to shew the Discipline of their own Country, (which is to make seeing and fighting all one) did presently mount the Sand-hills, with a Forlorn of 300 Musqueriers,<note place="margin">Dunkirk <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi>

perceiving that the resolution of these men was furiously to fall on at But-end, as highly resolved to keep them off at the Arms-end, by pouring down perpetually Volleys of Great and Small shot.</p>
                     <p>General <hi>Lockhart</hi> (newly preferred to that Command, and Embassador ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless to the French King) seeing the French unwilling to enter, now the English had opened the gap; and on the other side, seeing the gallantry of his own Regiment, who although they could no longer gain ground, yet still kept their station, notwithstanding they were exposed to the Enemies Assaults; caused a considerable Brigade of fresh men to reinforce those that had first born the brunt of the Battle. This Reserve (through General <hi>Lockhart</hi>'s care) coming in time to the relief of their tired fellows, made no long delay, but fell into the Spanish Foot with the But-ends of their Musquets, who not being able to withstand their courage,<note place="margin">

trim and dress did help to personate. In short, his own Domesticks and those best acquainted with him, nay even himself, were <hi>presumptuously</hi> confirmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any thoughts of his death, in the very desperation of his life, as will presently appear.</p>
                     <p>For it pleased Heaven, that had given us so many bitter Cups to drink, now to throw away the dregs of them in the Carcass of this Usurper, and empty this Vessel of his Wrath, which was as the 7th Vial, justly taking the forfeiture of all his Trophies and Victories, by his surrender on the appointed signal day of the 3d of <hi>September,</hi>

                     <p>He was taken sick at <hi>Hampton</hi>-court, having not been well in Minde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before (troubled with the last frantick words of his beloved Daughter <hi>Claypole,</hi> who threatned Judgement like another mad <hi>Cassandra,</hi> and with the insinuations and encroachments of the Republicans party into the Army; nor were some of his Relations taint-free of those principles, but were winding towards them.) The Disease was a bastard Tertian, which appeared not at first of any danger; but after a weeks time it began to shew very desperate Symptoms; wherefore he was removed to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where his Chaplains, and others of that pious Family, kept private meetings and Fastings for his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; of which they were so vainly confident (as before) that they obtruded their unseasonable thanks to God for the certainty of it, and with the same unseasonable flattery and pickthank with the Protector, deluded him into the like perswasion, so that he told his Physicians, <hi>He should not die this bout</hi>; but the Fits proving worse and worse,<note place="margin">Cromwel <hi>senseless before his death.</hi>

It was thought that he had designed <hi>Fleetwood</hi> in his ultimate thoughts; but the distraction of the choice betwixt his Son and Son-in-law, had made him leave it undetermined: (a private Will relating to his Family he made at his first sickning at <hi>Hampton</hi>-court.) Continuing in this condition, he died on Friday the 3d of <hi>September,</hi> at three of the clock in the afternoon, though divers rumours were spread, that he was carried away in the Tempest the day before. His Body being opened and Embalmed, his Milt was found full of Corruption and Filth; which was so strong and stinking, that after the Corps were Embalmed and filled with Aromatick Odours, and wrapt in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath six double, in an inner-sheet of Lead, and a strong Wooden-coffin; yet the Filth broke through them all, and raised such a noysome stink, that they were forced to bury him out of hand: but his Name and Memory stinks worse.</p>

                        </note>As to his Character, little can be added more, than what hath been said in the progress of this Chronicle: This various shifting Polititian, best shewing himself in his <hi>Contaction,</hi> nearness and present relation to the several Changes, and diversities of Affairs, Counsels, and Governments he passed; as the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melion</hi> appears in that colour that is next to it, and cannot otherwise be described. He was <hi>alter Ego,</hi> or with the <hi>Comedian,</hi> he might have given this devise, <hi>Ego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met ipse non sum Ego</hi>; and certainly the first of his designes were Enthusiasted, and he acted beyond himself, as prevailing in many things beyond the power of Reason or Strength, and indeed all imagination; such was the subversion of the Government, a thing not to be thought possible to be projected by one of such (every way) Insufficiencies. He was as <hi>feat</hi> a Priest as a Prince,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53069:210"/>
yet acted them both very well, according to the humour of the times, which are the Standard of Government. Sometimes Alloy is as current as pure Metal; and he could never have <hi>Princed</hi> it, but through the distempers and misrules that <hi>raigned</hi> before him; and his Preaching was none of the unserviceablest Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the preceding Anarchy and his own Usurpation: which made him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quit it to the last. The Turkish Emperours have always a Trade; and <hi>Oliver</hi>'s was this Knack, with which he was so much in love, that when in the <hi>Humble Petition</hi> there was inserted an Article against publick Preachers being Members of Parliament, he excepted against it disertly and expresly, <hi>Because he</hi> (he said) <hi>was one, and divers Officers of the Army, by whom much good had been done, and those things brought about</hi>; and therefore desired they would explain the said Article. But I am engaged far beyond my bounds. — He was, in sum, fit to have made a Prince of <hi>Tartars,</hi> or some other <hi>Cannibal</hi> Barbarous and Perfidious people; or had he been a <hi>Hun</hi> or a <hi>Vandal,</hi> we should have read him big and Famous in History. His Court-friends did so far extol him, that after his Death <hi>Sterry,</hi> one of his Sycophant Chaplains, was heard to preach, <hi>That he was certain, that that blessed Person</hi> (meaning <hi>Cromwel</hi>) <hi>was now sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Right Hand of God making Intercession,</hi> &amp;c. which was more than any meer Humane Glory could reach unto: and his Funerals were set out to such a pomp and ostentation, to vouch that value which by such people was set upon him.</p>

This Bed had fix'd about it an ascent of two steps; a little from thence stood eight silver Candlesticks about five foot high, with white Wax-tapers standing in them, of three foot long. All these things were environed with Rails and Ballasters four-square, covered with Velvet; at each corner whereof there was erected an upright Pillar, which bore on their tops Lions and Dragons, who held in their Paws Streamers Crowned. On both sides of the Bed were set up in Sockets four great Standards of the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53069:212"/>
Protector's Arms, with Banners and Banrols in War, painted upon Taffaty. About the Bed stood men in Mourning bare-headed; and without the Rails, others to receive people in, and turn them out again.</p>
                        <p>When this Show had been seen for many weeks together, the Scene was then altered; the Effigies being removed into another Room, it was there set up, standing upon an Ascent under a Cloath of State, being vested as it was before, lying; onely now his Purple-Velvet was changed for a Crown. In the same manner (as formerly) were men waiting upon him bare-headed. In this manner he continued until the 23 of <hi>November,</hi> which day was appointed to carry him with all solemnity to <hi>Westminster</hi>-abbey.</p>
                        <p>This great Funeral was performed with very great Majesty, in this manner following. All things being in readiness, the Waxen Picture of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor (with a Crown on his Head, a Sword by his Side, a Globe and Scepter in his Hands) was taken down from his standing, and laid in an open Chariot, covered all over with Black-Velvet, adorned with Plumes and Scutcheons, and drawn by six horses in Black-Velvet. The Streets from <hi>Somerset</hi>-house to <hi>Westminster</hi>-abbey, were guarded by Souldiers in new Red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>coats and Black-but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, with their Ensignes wrapt in Cypres; which made a lane to keep off Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators from crowding the Actors.</p>

These passing in fine order, at length came the Chariot with the Effigies, on each side of which were six Banner-Rolls, (twelve in all) born by several persons; and likewise several pieces of the Protector's Arms carried by eight Officers of the Army, attended by the Heralds. Next went <hi>Garter</hi> principal King of Arms, attended by a Gentleman on each hand bare-headed. Next came the chief Mourner. And to conclude all, came the Horse of Honour, in very rich Trappings embroidered on Crimson-Velvet, and adorned with White, Red, and Yellow plumes of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being led by the Master of the Horse. The Rear of this brave Show was brought up by the Protector's Guard of Halberdiers, the Warders of the Tower, and a Troop of Horse.</p>

This Synod or Assembly met now at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Prince <hi>Richard</hi> had the honour to have his Reign ennobled with a discovery of what Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency was, and its consistency, which the World never heard of before, nor was it the wiser or better satisfied now it was fully informed.

He began also to be weary of his Old Cavalier-Friends, and to require their absence from his Court, where now the Army beginning to swerve from their loving Addresses, the Republicans and <hi>Lambert</hi> secretly tampering with them, and undermining their Fidelity and Zeal to <hi>Oliver</hi>'s house, (as it was timely enough discovered) a resolution was taken to call a Parliament to meet the 27 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next,<note place="margin">Richard<hi>'s Parliament meet,</hi> Jan. 27.</note> and (by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of restoring the people to their antient way of Elections, but really) that the Court might command the more Votes, the Burroughs had Writs also se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Resolved, <hi>That it be part of this Bill to Recognize and declare his Highness</hi> Richard <hi>Lord Protector, and Chief Magistrate of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging.</hi> And 2. <hi>That before this Bill be committed, the House do declare such additional clauses to be part of this Bill, as may bound the power of the Chief Magistrate, and fully secure the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, and the Liberties and Rights of the people: And that neither this, nor any other previous Vote that is or shall be passed in order to this Bill, shall be of force, or binding to the people, until the whole Bill passed.</hi>

                           <p>Whilest the Temper of the House was thus tried, and they appeared suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to be English men, divers of the Members of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them in the same resolutions. By the joynt advice of the Court and Army-party, the question of Transacting with the persons sitting in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther House, as an House of Parliament, was set before them, upon pretended grounds of Law and Necessity, and by Arguments of Force and Interposition from the Army, and of impossibility to proceed in any thing without the said Other House. This attempt was as stoutly opposed for fourteen days by the moderate honest Patriots of the House, as the former; the undoubted right of the antient Peers asserted, and all the said grounds and Arguments confuted, except that of Force; which was not to take place with any thing like a Free-Parliament of English-men. But in the close of the fourteen days debate, wherein much of the Honesty, Ingenuity, and Courage of the English Nation did appear, (seeing all Affairs at a stand till something were resolved in this point) they came in a very full House to this well-qualified Resolution:</p>

                              </note>Resolved, <hi>That this House will transact with the persons now sitting in the Other House, as an House of Parliament, during this present Parliament: And that it is not hereby intended to Exclude such Peers as have been faithful to the Parliament from their priviledge of being duly summoned to be Members of that House.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The House of Commons (between the Protector, the Other House, and the General Council of Officers now summoned to meet at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-house) may well be conceived at this time to have had a Wolf by the Ears, and (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving shewed themselves <hi>English-men</hi> and not Slaves) had reason to entertain wary Counsels, having some of their own Members undermining them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors; and foreseeing a Dissolution, though not knowing whether they should die a Violent or Natural death, or have a mixt kinde of Disease, as it fell out afterwards. And therefore they resolved not to own them in the Other House as Lords, but called them, <hi>The persons now sitting in the Other House of Parliament</hi>; neither would they treat and confer with them in the usual way, as with the House of Peers, and therefore found out the new word of <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting</hi>; and not intending to have to do with them, but for a tryal, they limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the time to be during this present Parliament, which they foresaw would not be long: and to Muzzle the new inconsiderable Upstarts sufficiently, (if they should take too much upon them) they asserted the priviledge of the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53069:213"/>
ancient Peers as a good reserve, if the Parliament should by the Protector and Army be suffered upon second thoughts to sit longer than was first intended. And resolved also, <hi>That they would receive no Message from those persons sitting in the Other House, but by some of their own number.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The House of Commons by this time had also by a Saving Vote concerning the Fleet, asserted their interess in the Militia; and had under consideration an Act for taking away all Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances concerning the Excise and new Impost, and concerning Customes, Tunnage and Poundage, after three years. And had vindicated the peoples Liberties, by setting Major-General <hi>Overton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Portman,</hi> and divers others (illegally committed by the late Protector) at Liberty without paying Fees, and declaring their Imprisonment and Detention illegal and unjust; and had their Lord-Jaylor <hi>Berkstead,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at their Bar under question for the same (who was also Arrested upon the Exchange in <hi>London,</hi>

And had also a high resentment of the illegal sending Free-born English-men against their wills to the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and other Forrain Plantations, and to the Isles of <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Iersey,</hi> out of the reach of the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>; and had appointed a strict Bill to be prepared for remedy thereof. And had Examined and discovered many other Grievances brought upon the people by the Officers and Farmers of the Excise, and others; and by Major-Generals, amongst which <hi>Butler</hi> was for his insolent actings and high affronts to the Law and Courts of Justice, put out of the Commission of the Peace, and a Committee appointed to draw up an Impeachment against him. The Committee also for Inspection (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned) had brought in and reported to the House the state of the publick Accounts, and of the Martial and Civil Lists in the three Nations, by which it did appear, That the yearly Incomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> came to <hi>Eighteen hundred sixty eight thousand seven hundred and seventeen pounds:</hi>

                              </note> And the yearly Expences to <hi>Two Millions two hundred and one thousand five hundred and forty pounds:</hi> So that <hi>Three hundred thirty two thousand eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty three pounds</hi> of Debt incurred yearly by the ill management of double the Revenue that ever King of <hi>England</hi> enjoyed. And to maintain the unjust Conquest of <hi>Scotland,</hi> cost us yearly <hi>One hundred sixty three thousand six hundred and nineteen pounds</hi> more than the Revenue it yielded.</p>
                           <p>Many other particulars were under their consideration, as to the Religion and Civil Rights of the people, too long now to be mentioned: but in short, to give them their due, they did some good whilest they sate, both to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and particulars, and intended much more; and did no hurt, gave no Offices nor Gratuities to themselves out of the publick Treasure, nor granted any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the people; which is more than can be said of any Parliament in our memory.</p>
                           <p>Proceeding thus successfully and hopefully to the general satisfaction of the people in the three Nations who chose them, the Protector and chief Officers of the Army, who were jealous of one another before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Competitors for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, grew now jealous of the House of Commons also, who being the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives of the people, were become also their <hi>Minions</hi> and <hi>Favourites.</hi> It was therefore now thought seasonable to contend among themselves for the power,<note place="margin">

The Protector at last beginning, when it was too late, and but then thinking of securing himself from being surprized with their Complements, and stood upon his Guard. But the Commons-House, as became <hi>English-men,</hi> wisely and courageously resolved to let the Officers know, that they took them still to be their Servants, though they had for too many years ill deserved their Wages, Rebelling and Usurping the Government at their pleasure: and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to try what they meant by the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi>; which, as they seemed to represent it, smelt of Gunpowder and Ball; and whether the Repentance held forth in their said <hi>Representation,</hi> were real or Military, passed these Votes on Munday <hi>April</hi> 18.</p>

                     <p>And the same time, to shew their care of the Army, and to prevent jealousies, they passed these following Votes.</p>

                     <p>While the House spent the rest of their time in considering how to provide Money without laying new Burthens on the people, great contests grew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Protector and the opposite Officers of the Army, both sides keeping Guards night and day againct one another; the Protector having, in pursuance of the Votes of the House, forbidden the meetings of the Officers.</p>

And accordingly the same day, the Black Rod was sent twice to the House of Commons, (from <hi>Fiennes</hi> Speaker of the Other House) for them to come thither; but they admitted him not in, and much scorned the motion, having ever looked upon that Mushroom-house as the Lower-house, and their own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the language being to send <hi>down to the Other House,</hi> when they sent the Declaration for a Fast, for a trial of transacting with them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore understanding there were Guards of Horse and Foot in the <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> after some motion made by Mr. <hi>Knightly,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haselrig</hi> and others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> exceeded, That the House should first declare it Treason for any person whatsoever to put force upon any Members of the House: And next, that all Votes, Acts, and Resolutions, passed by any Members of Parliament, when the rest were detained from, or taken out of the House, should be null and void; and other motions becoming <hi>English-men</hi> to that end, judging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under a force, and finding they were very unanimous, though neer 400 in the House.

                        <p>Who though with much ado they got into the Lobby, (where they found Mr. <hi>Iames,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Herbert</hi>) they were not suffered, by the Officers of the Army, to go into the House, though they disputed their priviledge of Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, (if the Parliament were yet in being:) but Reason as well as the Laws must be silent among men of War: and therefore after they had fairly made their claim, and found the House under force, they retired, and resolved by Letter to acquaint the Speaker, and those Gentlemen assembled with him, what usage they had received.</p>
                        <p>And accordingly on Munday the 9 of <hi>May,</hi> they went to <hi>Westminster,</hi> where understanding that there were no Guards upon the House, Mr. <hi>Ansley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hungerford</hi> went up to the House, and had free admittance, receiving the Declaration of the 7th of <hi>May</hi> at the Door, which was published the same day; but Mr. <hi>Ansley</hi> walking afterwards into the Hall (the House not being ready to sit) to let the Members know, that though they were repulsed by force on Saturday, the House was open for honest men this day: at his return, Captain <hi>Lewson</hi> of <hi>Goff</hi>'s Regiment (as he confessed himself) and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, denied him entrance: he asking them, whether they were a Committee to judge of Members without doors? they said, No, but they were Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their superiour Officers to let none in that had not sate till <hi>April</hi> 1653. After some reasoning the case with them, the Captain told Mr. <hi>Ansley,</hi> that if he would give his Parol to return without sitting, he might go in and speak with whom he pleased; so upon his Parol passed to the Captain, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go in the second time, and soon after returned, telling the Captain as he came out, that he had kept his Parol, and wished he and the Souldiers would do the like. Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> continued still there, and resolved so to do, since he saw there was Force again upon the House; and had some discourse within doors, and made them lose that Morning, and adjourn by reason of his presence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Speakers taking the Chair: he attempted to sit again in the Afternoon, but found there a Troop of Horse, and two Companies of Red-coats, <hi>Keepers</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and so bid them farewel: immediately after which, to prevent further interruption in their works of Darkness from Honest men, they barred the Door against three parts of four of the Members of the House, by the following Vote.</p>

They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ordered the discontinuance of the Common Council for that year, and proceeded to nominate another, and to settle a new Militia.

                        <p>But after the pulling down of the Gates, the General sent a Letter to the Parliament, acquainting them how grievous and distastful the action was to his nature, intimating also the great Merit of the City towards them throughout the War; and on <hi>Friday,</hi> after several Conferences managed before him by some of the secluded Members and City, and others of the Rump, (He pretending his desire of satisfaction for their Exclusion, of the evidence of danger of their readmission, which the Rump were now unarmed to dispute, (his Commission from them as Commissioner for governing the Army being then also expired) (and the publication of a Petition subscribed by <hi>Barebone</hi>'s and others to abjure the King) as afterwards with the Mayor and Court of Aldermen at <hi>Guild hall,</hi> who used their endeavours with him in the business; he marched out of the City with his Army to their Quarters; and on <hi>Saturday</hi> sent another Letter to the Parliament, wherein he laid open the dangerous designes countenanced by themselves in conniving at <hi>Lambert,</hi> particularly the business of <hi>Barebone</hi>'s Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, setting forth that there had been Oaths too many already;<note place="margin">

Towards evening, the City rung every where with the news of it, with such Acclamations, and shone with so many Bonfires, (where they burnt and roasted all manner of Rumps in detestation of the Juncto then sitting) that it seemed a Theatre of mad &amp; extasied people; nor is it possible any expressions of it should reach the sense and belief of Posterity; Money being thrown among the Souldiers, as if now there would be no more occasion for it, but that the Golden Age swiftly approached: The Speaker at his return from the House being in danger of his life.

                  <p>The same divine Wisdom had taught the afflicted to humble themselves, and to rely more immediately upon his Justice, than that of their Cause; and to wait his retribution, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Essence it is to vindicate Right, and deliver the injured and oppressed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now was the acceptable time, by this prepared reception of the Mercie, wherein the sole Glory of the Miracle was visibly ascribable to himself; as to himself it mainly and chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, to rescue his own Honour &amp; Veracity from the impudent Blasphemies of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>The Triumphs of Atheists had almost prevailed unto Victory, and braved Heaven with their success, as if it were unconcerned below, and those Affairs were only at their disposal, which through so many shifts and variations had still reverted into the first hand, and seemed in meer fondness and play to have but hided from them: but they were now to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the Power they had seized and wrested, could never be aliened from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to whose Restitution so many Enforcements, both Divine and Humane, were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to concur, in this most happy and present Juncture of the Almighty's own appointment.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the former Disappointments, Defeats, and Disasters, which by irresistible Force and undiscoverable Treachery had hitherto all along exercised the Heroical patience of our Soveraign, had most severely afflicted the Loyalty of many of his Subjects in their Lives and Estates, and seemed to threaten the Constancie of the rest with the like Fate (the power circulating, like an ill winde, into the same corner whence our Tempest first arose, which by vulgar conjecture portended its boysterous duration there,) had so far indisposed the minds of men to desire or hope for any thing but a lingring death of the English Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Freedom and Laws, that it was a preceding Miracle to their Restauration, that there was vertue enough left among our selves, to resume and re-engage in that calamitous and
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53069:228"/>
destructive Enterprise, or that any should be of that unshaken and noble confidence as to put himself upon those Rocks by which so many had already perished.</p>

                     </note>But (as in the Jewish servitude and slavery to the Philistins, and at the expiration of their Babylonish Captivity, God raised up men to be his great and glorious Instruments, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about those his gracious purposes) so did he inspire and animate some eminent persons of this Nation, now his displeasure was almost ceased, with Courage and Conduct suitable to the Atchievement of our Redemption. Indeed it may be said, that he caused the whole Chain and Series of his Providence to conspire and combine against this arrogant and most Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Usurpation; who forgetting that they were the Scourge in Gods hands to chastise us, would have his Omnipotence the Sword in theirs to consume us; as they had all along in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled him to their actions and successes.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose did he so often remove and change their Modules of Government, and some of those Leaders and Rulers themselves, never suffering them to come to any consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but in the fairest hopes of it, like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> caused it to moulder and perish: By this means at last exasperating and clashing them one against the other, while with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and mutual hate, they pursued their Prey, the Estates of King and Kingdom; which the one having seized, the other never left snarling and baying at his fellow, while the Owner came in and recovered his right from them both.</p>

                  <p>However, it pleased the Divine Wisdom to free us at once from the kindness and danger of Forreign assistance, and to put this his great Work into the hands of true English men, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone did operate in this wonderful change; that it might not be imputed to us the most famous Islanders in the World,<note place="margin">

of a Proclamation: Yet since Proclamations in such cases have been always used, to the end that all good Subjects might upon this occasion testifie their Duty and Respect. And since the Armed Uiolence, and other the Calamities of many years last past, have hitherto deprived us of any opportunity, wherein we might express our Loyalty and Allegiance to his Majesty: We therefore, the Lords and Commons now assembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, together with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Free-men of this Kingdom now present, do according to our Duty and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, heartily, joyfully, and unanimously, Acknowledge and Proclaim, That immediately upon the decease of our late So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First, the Imperial Crown of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the Kingdoms, Dominions, and Rights belonging to the same, did by Inherent Birthright, and lawful undoubted Succession, descend, and come to his Most Excellent Majesty King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, as being line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, justly, and lawfully next Heir of the Blood Royal of this Realm; and that by the goodness and providence of Almighty God, He is of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the most Potent, Mighty, and Undoubted King.

                  <p>This was Solemnized with the greatest Magnificence and joy possible, the Lords and Commons, and Lord Mayor attending it: the shouts and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the reading of it in <hi>Cheap-side</hi> were so loud and great, that <hi>Bow-bells,</hi> or any other Bells in the Town (though all then Ringing) could not be heard.

                     </note> the King heard Doctor <hi>Hardy</hi> (after Dean of <hi>Rochester</hi>) Preach before him: the place intended was the French-Church, after their Sermon; but they knowing of it, being greedy to see the King, would not come out of their Seats; so that it was done in the Princesses Lodgings. Here the King touched many of the Evil.

Your Majesty shall see presently all the streets filled, all the ways covered, and all the hills loaden with people which will follow you even to the place of your Embarquement, and would not leave you, if they had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pass them to your Kingdom. Our joy is common unto us with that of our Subjects: but as we know better than they the inestimable value of the Treasure we possess, so are we more sensible of this sad separation.

We acquiesce therein, because we know that this removal is no less necessary for us, than glorious to your Majesty; and that 'tis in your Kingdom that we must finde the accomplishment of the prayers we have made, and make still for you and us: so shall we not fail to profit thence, as well as from the assurances which it hath pleased you to give us of an immutable affection towards this Republick.

We pray God, Sir, that it be quiet and happy; and that as he hath disposed the hearts and affections of your Subjects to acknowledge their Soveraign and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, it will please him also to command the Winds and Seas to expedite your Voyage; and that after you have received on your own Coast the same Prayers which we shall reiterate, you may injoy in your Royal Person, and in your Posterity for ever, all the Felicity and Prosperity which your humble Servants wish unto your Majesty.</p>

Last of all, Five Regiments of the Army-Horse, with Back, Brest, and Head-piece, which diversified the Show with delight and Terrour.

                        <hi>Sir</hi> Heneage Finch <hi>opens the Indictment.</hi>
                     </note> and among all people, counted an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Treason, as the story of the two Eunuchs against <hi>Ahasuerus; Voluerunt insurgere,</hi> they only had a Will to rise up against him: and the testimony of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, qui deliberant desciverant</hi>; who consult of this Fact, are Rebels already. That it is not the sole interest of one Royal Person concerned in this parricide, but all of the Nation. That Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> hath a Notion, that to the perfection of this Law of the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. a time to be limited to the accuser was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site; but how great a mistake that was, would appear by this, That this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had so long out-faced the Law, and the Justice of the Kingdom, that if there had been a time of limitation, there would have been no time nor place left to punishment; and so the guilt would have stuck upon the Kingdom, and this wickedness grown up into an impunity. That the scope of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, for the compassing of the King's death; the rest, as usurping power over the King's person, the Assembling, Sitting, and Judging, are but as so many overt Acts to prove the intentions of the heart; all which are not necessary to be proved against every particular person. That every other overt Act, besides what is laid in the Indictment, as incouraging of the Souldiers to cry Justice and Execution, or preaching up the Work as godly, may be given in evidence against the guilty persons, whose Crime was of that unmeasurable impiety, that it could neither be heightned by any aggravation, or lessened by any excuse. Then he traced the steps and gradations to this Villany from the Treaty in 1648, and shewed the wicked Circumstances and Formalities thereof; particularly he declared this person of those living (twenty six being already deceased, and six or seven reserved to other penalties, and a sorrowful repentance; and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine more before their Lordships) to be the onely chief Leader, Captain, and Conductour in this horrible Treason: and hinted at his sawcy demeanour to the King in his bringing him to his Tryal; his irreverend speeches and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages then towards the King; at his malicious designe of blacking him to the people. Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> used the like harangue; and then the Witnesses were sworn; and after evidence given, Mr. <hi>Windham</hi> closed it with this Speech: That the Indictment was for compassing the King's death; there lay the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: for there is not one word in that Statute of killing the King; insomuch that if after that sitting upon the King, they had acquitted him, yet would it have been Treason still: that this imagination of <hi>Harrison</hi>'s was plainly proved, and the more confirmed by his mention of blacking the King: that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed he sat, and signed, and therefore there was no difficulty in the Verdict.</p>
                  <p>This saying of his, of blacking the King, was proved by one Mr. <hi>Nutly,</hi> who having got admittance into the Committee that drew up the Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, over-heard him say those words upon a dispute of contracting the said Charge; which <hi>Harrison</hi> rejected, for this Reason, as knowing [<hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niare fortiter, aliquid haerebit</hi>] of a multitude of imputations, some of them would stick. It will be a trouble, cumberance, and labour to the Reader, to particularize any more Speeches of the King's Counsel, or their shewing the Record of the Warrant for Execution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to every one of the Prisoners; or the Courts denying the Prisoners Counsel, because it is very neer the same throughout; and therefore there is here subjoyned only a breviate of each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons defence, referring the more unsatisfied and curious to the Original and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Copy of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harrison</hi> began his by a strange argumentation, from the notoriety of the Fact, that it was not done in a corner; that he believed God was with his servants in those days, (however it seemed good to him to suffer this turn to come upon them:) that he had desired to know the minde of God in it; but he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53069:235"/>
no conviction of the evil of it, but rather assurance; professed the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness of his Nature to Man, Woman, and Childe; that he followed not his own judgement, but his Conscience to the Lord; that he had suffered impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, because he would not turn aside from the Cause to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and refused his temptation of sitting at his right hand: That what he had done in this matter, was by authority of Parliament; and that this, nor any other inferiour Court, hath any Cognizance or Jurisdiction on that: and therefore, they could not question him that acted in obedience to that Authority; and that he did act in the fear of God.</p>
                  <p>Hereat the Court and Auditory were agast, and cried, Away with him, for he made God the Author of his wickedness: and as to the pretended Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Actions he warranted thereby, It was answered, that if the Lords and Commons in full Houses had then taken upon them such Authority, it had yet been Treason: For the Lords and Commons do not, nor never did, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a Parliament, without the King; but that there was not an eighth part of the House of Commons that contrived and ordered this Treason. And to this purpose spoke Mr. <hi>Annesly,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> and Mr. (now Lord) <hi>Hollis,</hi> ripping up the violence and insolence of this Prisoner and his Associates in forcing the House of Commons, and secluding them and other Members thereof in <hi>December</hi> 1648. That this discourse was to infect the people; and Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> added, that he had the Plague all over him: and the whole Court unanimously, and severally, rejected that treasonable Tenet of an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in both or either Houses without the King; and over-ruled that Plea. To which <hi>Harrison</hi> was instant for Counsel to assist him. After some interlocuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he began a discourse of the War; the Kings setting up his Standard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the people (and that God is no respecter of persons) and shedding of innocent blood: and being interrupted there, avouching the same Authority again, he profest his abhorrence of blacking the King; aequivocated with his bringing the King to his Tryal from <hi>Hurst</hi>-castle; for he was commanded to do it from the General: At last he urged his impreparation for his Tryal, being six months a close Prisoner; but that he had some Acts of the Parliament rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to produce to his justification: and here he concluded. And Judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, the Jury gave in their Verdict, (which they did without stirring from the place) and Sentence was past upon him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Sentence.</hi>
                     </note> in these words: <hi>You are to be led back to the place from whence you came, and from thence to be drawn on a Hurdle to the place of Execution, and there you shall be hanged by the Neck; and being alive shall be cut down, your privy Members to be cut off, your Entrails to be taken out of your Body, and you living, the same to be burnt before your eyes; and your Head to be cut off, your Body to be divided into four parts, and your Head and Quarters to be disposed at the pleasure of the Kings Majesty.</hi> And so he was returned to Newgate, in order to Execution.</p>
                  <p>Colonel <hi>Adrian Scroop</hi> was next set to the Bar;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> Adrian Scroop.</note> and after some challenge of the Jury, which (as <hi>Harrison</hi> did before, and all the rest after) was to pick out the meanest of them, afraid of the Gentry, over whom they had tyrannously and insolently Lorded; and convicted by the same evidence of sitting in the High Court, and subscribing the Warrant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As also by the testimony of Sir <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> the Lord Mayor Elect for the next year, who witnessed that since the Return of the King, in some accidental conference, he seemed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and approve of the Fact, by saying, Many people did not think it such a heynous matter; or that some be of one minde, and some of another: which he denied now to have expresly said; but bewailed the misfortune of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with Sir <hi>Richard</hi>; for whereas before he was not excepted out of the Act of Indemnity, the very last day it passed he was by that means even then excepted. He justified that Authority, and the Fact committed by that Authority, but not the person; protested he had no malice against the King, and that it was an errour of Judgement, not of his Will: that he took the Parliament's Authority for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, (but over-ruled by a precedent Tryal) acquainted the Jury that he lay under a great prejudice by the Fact, and desired them to consider his Case as they
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53069:236"/>
would their own; and hinted at the benefit of the Proclamation: he was found likewise guilty, and sentenced.</p>

He obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the word <hi>Instrumental</hi> in the exception of the Act, was insignificant, or otherwise incomprehensive of him: that by the Kings gracious Letter, a Free Parliament was to declare the excepted persons; which this could not be, not being called by his Majesties Writ. All which were fully Answered by Sir <hi>Heneage Finch</hi>; but for fear I may pervert or miss the sinewy strength of that Reply, this shall suffice to be the reduction; That his entring the Charge, and a protestation in the Conclusion of Liberty to put in a new one, and desiring that the King as a Traytor may be brought to Justice, was no such demand as could be imagined to end in acquittal: that to the Act of Indemnity, the Parliament having made a special proviso, and inserted him by name therein, the Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding him, it is not material what the subsequent Reasons are; so that though he might say, the Parliament was mistaken in their Reason, yet not in their Conclusion.</p>

said, that in case the Parliament, was not a right Parliament, that Letter in it self is no Pardon, until it had been under the Broad Seal, and in more express terms, as in the Case of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh:</hi> but as to the Parliament, it is plain the King meant this Parliament, the Letter being directed <hi>to the Speaker of our House of Commons</hi>; to them it was left to provide for security and indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to expiate this crying Sin; and to dispence his Mercy and Justice in this particular: they then Address themselves to his Majesties Clemency for the whole Nation, and the Kings Proclamation grants a Pardon; so that this must needs be the Parliament, though as the times were, it were not so duly Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, but since Confirmed by his Majesty. It was added by Mr. <hi>Windham,</hi> that words and advice, when the Act follows, will make any Counsellor guilty: as if a Counsellor should advise one man to kill another, and he does it. All was sum'd up in an accurate repetition of it, with Evidence and Defence, by Sir <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando Bridgman</hi>; and he thereupon found guilty. The Court used him very civilly, and he shewed very much respect and reverence to the Court, behaving himself to the removing of that prejudice which the generality had of him, as of a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. But see what a narrow Fortune, and the streights of Debt, and the Devils wide World, and vast Preferments can tempt man to, since his first Delusions bewitcht our understanding!</p>

                     <hi>Daniel Axtel</hi> was next set to the Bar, (He had escaped as he thought the exception in the Act, being lately added to this miserable number, for there was other blood barbarously shed by him, that lay upon him) and charged with imagining and compassing the Kings Death; the overt Act whereof was commanding the Guard at his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; his beating the Souldiers for not crying out Justice and Execution; for bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to do it, and to shoot at a Lady, supposed the Lady <hi>Fairfax,</hi> whom he there termed Whore, for saying that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was a Rogue, and that the twentieth part of the People never consented to the Tryal of the King. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he said, that he was Commanded thither by his General, whom the Lords and Commons had Commissioned: that they had declared themselves to be the Interpreters of the Law; and if he had not obeyed his Generals Command, he was then liable to the Punishment: that that Statute of 25 <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. did not extend to private persons in that Case: that <hi>Iermyn, Nichols,</hi> and <hi>Thorpe</hi> Judges, had declared, that it was lawful and justifiable to obey the Parliament: that if the Collected body in Parliament be guilty of Treason, where will they find a Jury to try him in the distributed part of the People? (Here he was charged for being one of those that actually and in person put the force upon the House, by Mr. <hi>Annesly,</hi> and made the Parliament a Juncto.) To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That he was not to Justifie that fault; for being no Statesman, he did as commanded: produced his Commission; said, that <hi>Fairfax,</hi> nay General <hi>Monke</hi> were guilty for acting by the same Commission: that it was no Treason to silence a Lady that spoke impertinently: and being charged with smiling at the same time, he said that was no Treason; that he was set there to keep the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:53069:237"/>
Peace: that the People and Souldiers did cry <hi>Iustice, Iustice</hi>; &amp; to quiet the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he might beat them; and say, <hi>I'le Iustice you, I'le Execution you.</hi> That at the worst, Justice being an Attribute of God, it were no Treason to require it; and that the execution of it is no more. He took much advantage of a Witness against him, who said he had been imprisoned by him: his Evidence was about hiring the Executioner; to which one <hi>Nelson</hi> likewise, and <hi>Hewlet</hi> was named. That, as <hi>Cook</hi> said before, he neither Sentenced, Signed, Sealed, nor Sate: that <hi>Throgmorton</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days was acquitted for Words: that Words may make a Heretick, not a Traytor; and cited Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> urged also the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. ayding the King <hi>de facto.</hi> He was answered to all, that there are no excuses for Treason: That the Parliament could never give any Authority to Murther the King, nor the General; nor was it in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Guard the Court of Justice at <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, nor to cry for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: that any of those things was an Overt Act of his imagination, and Proved sufficiently, that Justice and Execution was the intent of Murthering the King; and his wrathful Speech to the Lady discovered it. After a little Consultation, the Jury brought him in guilty; to whom he had pleaded his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and small Children.</p>

Nor was it just or civil she should be here received without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and expiation of those Crimes, the very tendencies whereto had so rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven her to seek her safety abroad. The King brought her back to his Palace at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> after Nineteen years discontinuance, the second of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> with her came the Illustrious Princess <hi>Henrietta,</hi> who had never breathed <hi>English</hi> Air, but some two years after her birth, which hapned in <hi>Exeter, Iune</hi> 16. 1644. as also Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> brother to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and to the Prince Elector Palatine, an absolute stranger to these Kingdoms.

have past by those many undutiful and irreverent usages of him, by him and the Kirk, while He was there among them: but such was the general hatred and detestation of that People (and especially of the Nobility) against him, that the King gave order for his Commitment while he was waiting at Court.<note place="margin">Argyle <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>

                  <p>This happy Parliament, which had rebuilt the Glorious Structure of the <hi>English</hi> Ancient and Renowned Government, and had assured the Foundation thereof in the Established Throne of our Soveraign, came to its Period.

                  <p>The Princess of <hi>Aurange</hi> was buried with a private Funeral; in the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, I shall crave leave for this digression: there was indeed as much Honour in that privacy, as there was vain and profane solemnity in the gewgaw <hi>Exequies</hi> of <hi>Oliver,</hi> which wanted of their due Grandeurs till his <hi>Execution.</hi> In opposition therefore to that rabble medley of a Funeral, it will not be <hi>extravagant</hi> to set down, here, the Compact, yet Illustrious manner of this Princess, to shew the difference betwixt Princes and Ring-leaders of the Rout.</p>

                     </note> even beyond all Example or History of the most perdite sort of men: For but a handful of these wild People dared to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the City of <hi>London,</hi> and that at two several times: First, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the Sixth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1660. After their meeting at <hi>Coleman</hi>-street in the same City (having then a gracious Liberty from the King for their Devotion) they Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themselves, and came to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in the Dusk of the Evening, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mustered and ordered their small Party, they placed Centinels for the time, one of whom killed an Innocent Person coming by accidentally, for saying, (when he was demanded by them who he was for) <hi>For God and King</hi> Charles. After this Exploit the Alarm being given, and some Parties of the Trained Bands coming upon them and Charging them, after they had repulsed those few Files, they Marched to <hi>Bishops-gate,</hi> where they passed, and from thence to <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> where they came into the City again, and so to <hi>Aldersgate,</hi> where the Constable (being weakly attended) at their threatning him for the Keys, let them out again. Here they declared themselves for <hi>King Iesus,</hi> and their <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Masters</hi> upon the Gates: Thence they proceeded to <hi>Beech-lane,</hi> where a Headborough opposing them, they shot him, and killed him. [It is observable, that none whomsoever, or wheresoever they shot, recovered of the hurt; it being conceived they poysoned their Bullets and Slugs, by chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or other destructive Art.] And so with all haste made towards <hi>Canewood,</hi> where they lurked a while, resolving to make another Insurrection in the City, till they were routed by a Party of Horse and Foot sent to drive them out thence, and some Thirty taken Prisoners and brought before the General, who sent them to the <hi>Gate-house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the others, after they had quitted the Wood, returned for <hi>London,</hi> with assurance of success in their begun enterprize; <hi>Venner</hi> telling them (a Wine-Cooper by Trade) <hi>he was assured that no Weapons formed against them should prosper, nor a hair of their Head be touched</hi>; which their impunity in their first attempt made them very credulous of, even to an absolute confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>It may not be omitted, that just before this sudden eruption, the King was gone to Conduct his Mother and Sister (who feared the same mortal Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the small Pox, and had had some grudges thereof) to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> in order to their Embarquing for <hi>France</hi>; which opportunity they took for their
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:53069:240"/>
Rebellious Tumult, having disposed, as they thought, the minds of their late Party to take part with them, by their Declaration, called, <hi>A door of Hope opened,</hi> stuft with abominable slanders against the whole Royal Family, and the General, who (with the Duke of <hi>York</hi>) appeared presently with part of the Life-Guards to suppress them.</p>
                  <p>To proceed: on <hi>Wednesday</hi>-morning, <hi>Ianuary</hi> the Ninth, after the Watches and Guards were removed, they re-inforced their first Enterprize. Their first effort and appearance was at <hi>Thredneedle-street,</hi> where they alarm'd the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Band that was to watch all that Day; a Party of whom being sent out to follow them, were forced to retreat to their Mainguard; who Marching in a Body towards them, the Fifth-Monarchists retreated into <hi>Bishops-gate-street,</hi> some of them into an Ale-house known by the Sign of the <hi>Helmet,</hi> where, after a sharp Dispute, two were killed, and as many taken; the same number being killed and wounded of the Trained-Bands. The next sight of them (for they were just like wild-fire) was at <hi>Golledg-Hill,</hi> by which way they went up into <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> and so into <hi>Wood-street, Venner</hi> being their chief Leader, having a Murrion on his Head, and a Halbert in his Hand. Here was the main and fiercest Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for they fought stoutly with two of the Trained-Bands of Foot, in very good Discipline and Order. Here also they received a Charge from the Horse of the Life-Guard, whom they put to the Retreat, till being over-powr'd, and <hi>Venner</hi> knockt down and wounded with Shot, <hi>Tufney</hi> and <hi>Crag,</hi> two more of the chief of their Teachers being killed by him, they began to give ground, and soon after dispersed themselves in flight, taking several routs and ways. The greatest part of them went down <hi>Wood-street</hi> to <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> firing in the Rear at the Trained-Bands of <hi>Yellow,</hi> then in close pursuit of them. This Train-Band lodged ten of them in the <hi>Blew-Anchor</hi> Alehouse by the Postern; which house they maintained. Soon after came Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Cox</hi> with his Company, and surrounded all places about it. In the interim, part of the <hi>Yellow</hi> aforesaid had gotten up into the Tylings of the next House, which they threw off, and fired in, the Rebels being in the uppermost Room, who even then refused Quarter; when at the very same time another File of Muskets got up the Stairs, and having shot down the door, entred upon them: six of them were killed before, another wounded, and one refusing of Quarter, then also was knockt down with the But-end, and afterwards shot with a Musket. The rest being demanded why they craved not quarter before? answered, <hi>They durst not, for fear their own Fellows should shoot them</hi>; such was their Resolution and Desperation.</p>
                  <p>The whole number of this last Insurrection cannot be reckoned to more than Fifty Persons: though not above Forty were ever seen together, yet so great was their confidence in the Revelations of their Teachers, that they presumed to Subdue and Conquer with that small remnant, alluding to that History of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> recorded in Holy Writ; admitting of no other Sect but the Quakers, (and but those also who agreed with them in the Tenet of their Monarchy) being the nearest of Affinity to their Enthusiastick Opinions, to have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of partaking with them in this their great and glorious Design, as they termed it in their aforesaid Declaration; wherein they further Blasphemously said, <hi>That if they were deceived or misled, 'twas God that deceived them</hi>; laying their delusions, and charging their sinful and desperate folly upon him as the Author.</p>
                  <p>In this Tumult and Rebellious Insurrection were slain of the Kings Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Twenty two, and as many of the Traytors, most whereof were killed in Houses; and some after being taken Prisoners, for refusing to tell their Names were presently shot. There were taken Twenty, besides a few upon suspicion: the Twenty were as followeth, <hi>viz. Thomas Venner</hi> the Wine-cooper their Captain, <hi>Roger Hodgkins</hi> a Button-seller in St. <hi>Clements-lane Lumbard-street; Leonard Gowler, Ionas Allen, Iohn Pym, William Orsingham, William Ashton,

Giles Pritchard</hi> A Cow-keeper, <hi>Stephen Fall, Iohn Smith, William Corbet, Iohn Dod, Iohn Elston, Thomas Harris, Iohn Gardener, Robert Bradley, Richard Marten, Iohn Patshal, Robert Hopkins,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Wells</hi>; five of these had been in the design against <hi>Oliver,</hi> as before. These were brought to the Bar together; the Wounded-men had Chairs allowed them: and after the Indictment read to them, which was laid both to Treason and Murther, <hi>Thomas Venner</hi> was first called, who, when he had held up his hand at his Arraignment, being asked Guilty, or Not Guilty, began a wild Phanatique discourse about his Conversation in <hi>New England,</hi> and concerning the Fifth Monarchy, and the Testimony within him above these Twenty years, with such like impertinent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and stories. He confessed <hi>he was in the late Rising, but was not guilty of Treason, intending not to levy War against the King</hi>; and so sallied out into the same nonsensical defences as at first: but at the Court's instance of his Pleading directly to the Indictment, he answered <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and put himself upon his Country. In the like manner <hi>Hodgkins,</hi> after some rambling diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his present Business, and the Threats of the Court of his being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded Mute, and the submission of the rest of his Fellows, (who all pleaded, after some previous excursions in their way and manner) pleaded likewise to the Indictment: whereupon the Witnesses being sworn, two against every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Person, they made it appear, <hi>That</hi> Venner, Tufney, <hi>and</hi> Cragg, (the two last whereof were slain in the Business) <hi>did several times perswade their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to take up Arms for King</hi> Jesus, <hi>against the Powers of the Earth,</hi> (which were his Majesty, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the General:) <hi>That they were to kill all that opposed them: That they had been Praying and Preaching, but not Acting for God: That they Armed themselves at their Meeting-house in</hi> Coleman-street <hi>with Blunderbusses, Musquets, &amp;c.</hi> and other particular Evidence against each to matter of Fact. The proof against <hi>Martin, Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> was not so full, and against <hi>Patshal</hi> only one Witness; who were acquitted by the Jury. The other sixteen being found Guilty, and brought to the Bar, were demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to shew Cause why Sentence should not pass against them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord Chief Justice <hi>Foster</hi> charging this <hi>Venner</hi> with the Blood of his Complices by his Seduction and leading of them; He answered, <hi>He did not.</hi> To which the Witnesses being produced again, he Blasphemously quibled, and said, <hi>It was not he, but Iesus that led them.</hi> Three of them confest their Crime and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and craved Mercy; so they were all sixteen Condemned to be <hi>Hang'd, Drawn,</hi> and <hi>Quartered.</hi> According to which Sentence, on Saturday <hi>Ianuary</hi> 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1660, <hi>Venner</hi> and <hi>Hodgkins</hi> (both uncured of the Wounds they received in their Rebellion) being guarded by two Companies of the Trained-Bands, were drawn on a Sledge from <hi>Newgate</hi> through <hi>Cheapside,</hi> over against their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-house in <hi>Swar-Alley</hi> in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> and Executed according to their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <hi>Venner</hi> spoke little but in vindication of himself and his Fact, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Opinion, being confident <hi>the Time was at hand when other Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be</hi>;<note place="margin">

This, was the Crown profaned by the lewd hands of those prostitute Members at <hi>Westminster,</hi> when the <hi>Regalia</hi> were seized on by them, and by <hi>H. M.</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thought fit to be <hi>alienated</hi> to the Publique, that is, shared among the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. This was the Crown, afterwards violated, deprived, and widdowed of that Sacred and Royal Head of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr. This was the Crown which alone of all the <hi>Insignia</hi> of Majesty, (as <hi>Elijah</hi> of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that had not bowed their knees to <hi>Baal</hi>) abhorred the Idolatry of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Usurpation, and escaped the ravishing and polluted hands of that Tyrant, when like <hi>Caligula,</hi> that set the heads of the gods upon his own Statues, he assumed all the other Regalities of his rightful Soveraign, but could no way fit this Sacred Symbole of Majesty (though he could all other Holy things, and the Scripture it self,) to his impious designments. That was that Crown which the Malignity of a dire Pestilence had envied the sight and blessing thereof to the City of <hi>London,</hi> his Majesties Imperial Chamber (which sadly felt the other Plagues of War and Want in a more forcible absence of it thereafter) at his Royal Fathers Inauguration, and was now Boded and bespoke with the like Contagion; when never were the Influences of Heaven more curiously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, the two Serene days of that Solemnity exsiccating and exhaling those vapours, which a long moisture to the danger of a Flood did seem to portend. Lastly, this was that Crown, whose just and ancient Discent, under which we have flourished ever since we were a Nation, till our late Anarchy; upon the Head of this Miraculous Prince, now vindicated it self from the indignities and assaults of base and insolent Demagogues, who from our Kings regardlesness of State and Sovereignty, have evermore wrought their contempt in the Subject: who now, with a like joy of reverence, fear, and love, beheld this awful and most delightful Triumph which is here related.</p>

                     <p>Two days were allotted to the Consummation of this great and most cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Action, the wonder, and admiration, and delight of all Persons both Forraign and Domestick: and pity it was, that the solid and lasting happiness it portended should not have taken up a Month, and given it the name <hi>Coronalis.</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> Street, near <hi>Lime</hi>-Street-end, was Erected the First Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Arch after the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order: on the North-side, on a Pedestal, before the Arch, was a Woman personating REBELLION, mounted on a <hi>Hydra,</hi> in a Crimson Robe torn, Snakes crawling on her Habit, and begirt with Serpents, and her Hair Snaky; a Crown of Fire on her Head; a bloody Sword in one hand, a Charming Rod in the other. Her attendant, CONFUSION, in a deformed Shape, a Garment of several ill-matched Colours, and put on the wrong way; on her Head Ruines of Castles; torn Crowns, and broken Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in each Hand.</p>
                     <p>On the South-Pedestal was a Representation of BRITAIN'S MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARCHY, supported by LOYALTY, both Women; <hi>Monarchy</hi> in a large purple Robe, adorn'd with Diadems and Scepters; over which, a loose Mantle, edg'd with blue and silver Fringe, resembling Water, the Map of <hi>Great Britain</hi> drawn on it: on her Head <hi>London,</hi> in her right hand, <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>; in her left, <hi>Dublin: Loyalty</hi> all in White, three Scepters in her right Hand, three Crowns in her left.</p>
                     <p>The first Painting on the South-side is a Prospect of His Majesties landing at <hi>Dover</hi>-Castle, Ships at Sea, great Guns going off, one kneeling and kissing the Kings Hand; Souldiers, Horse and Foot, and many people gazing. Above,

Indeed it were in vain to attempt to express this Solemnity, it was so far from being utterable, that it is almost inconceiveable: and much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it caused in Outlandish persons, who were acquainted with our late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Confusions, (to the ruine almost of three Kingdoms) which way it was possible for the English to appear in so Rich and Stately a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>It is incredible to think what costly Cloathes were worn that day; the Cloaks could hardly be seen what Silk or Sattin they were made of, for the Gold and Silver-Laces and Embroidery that was laid upon them: the like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was seen in their Foot-cloaths. Besides the inestimable value and treasures of Diamonds, Pearl and other Jewels, worn upon their Backs and in their Hats: To omit also the sumptuous and rich Liveries of their Pages and Footmen; (some suits of Liveries amounting to fifteen hundred pounds;) the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness of these Liveries, and the orderly march of them; as also the state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Equipage of the Esquires attending each Earl by his Horse-side: so that all the World that saw it, could not but confess, that what they had seen before, was but solemn Mummery, to the most August, noble and true Glories of this great day.</p>
                        <p>In this order the King arrived at <hi>White-hall</hi> a good time before the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then retired himself to Supper, and so to his Rest, to recommence the next day, and to put an end to this Triumph. On the 23 of <hi>April,</hi> St. <hi>George</hi>'s day, to consummate the Coronation, the King came from his Privy-stairs to the <hi>Old Palace,</hi> to a Room called the Princes Lodgings, behinde the House of Lords, and stayed there till the Lords and his Train had Robed and ranked themselves in <hi>Westminster</hi>-hall; who being ready, the King placed himself on a Throne at the upper end thereof, when the Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi> (with the Prebends in their rich Copes, each having a part of the <hi>Regalia</hi>) with St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Crown, came and delivered them to the Lord High-Constable, and he to the Lord Great Chamberlain, who set them on a Table; and the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately bestowed them on this manner; (Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> the Master of the Kings Jewels, having laid the Sword of State and Sword called <hi>Curtana</hi> with two others on the same Table) St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Staff to the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> the Spurs to the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> the pointed Sword on the left hand of <hi>Curta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> the pointed Sword on the right to the Earl of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Curtana</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Sword of State to the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> the Scepter with the Dove to the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> the Orb with the Cross to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Crown to the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> the <hi>Patina</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the <hi>Chalice</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> and then his Majesty set forward on foot (in the same order as before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) upon blue Cloath laid upon the ground from the Hall to his Chair in the Abbey,<note place="margin">

                        <p>All the Peers with their Coronets in their hands came up along with his Majesty, till his Majesty was placed in a Chair of State (not in his Throne:)
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:53069:246"/>
then the Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> went to every of the four-sides of the Throne, and at every of them spoke to the People in these words. <hi>Here I present unto you</hi> KING CHARLES <hi>the rightful Inheritor of the Crown of this Realm. Wherefore all you that are come this day to do your Homage, Service, and bounden duty, be ye willing to do the same?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereupon all the Peers in their Parliament-Robes, and People, gave a shout, testifying their willingness. This while the King standing from his Chair, turned himself to every of the four sides of the Throne, and at every of them spake to the People, who again with loud acclamations signified their willingness all in one voice. After which the Choire sung an Anthem, in the interim whereof his Majesty, Supported by the two Bishops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and attended by the Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> went to the steps before the Communion-Table, where upon Carpets and Cushions the King offered a Pall and a piece of Gold.</p>
                        <p>After his Majesty had offered, he went on the right hand, and kneeled down during a short Collect or Prayer; and then Sermon began, which was Preached by the Lord Bishop of <hi>WORCESTER.</hi> Sermon being ended, the Lord-Bishop of <hi>LONDON</hi> went to the King, for the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and asked if he were pleased to take the Oath usually taken by his Predecessors; to which his Majesty shewed himself most willing.</p>
                        <p>Then his Majesty rose out of his Chair, and by those two that before Assisted Him, was led up to the Communion-Table, where he made a solemn Oath to observe those things he had before promised. After this Oath, the King return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Chair, and kneeled at his foot-stool, while the Hymn of the Holy Ghost was singing; which ended, the Letany was sung by two Bishops.</p>
                        <p>After which, the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> began and said, <hi>Lift up your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Then his Majesty arose from his Devotion, and dis-robed himself of his upper Garment (his under Garment being so made, as the places to be anointed might be opened by undoing certain loops; which the Arch-Bishop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, his Majesty sitting in a Chair.) The Archbishop first Anointed the Palms of both his hands, the Choire singing an Anthem; after which and certain Prayers, the Lord Arch-bishop proceeded and anointed his breast between the shoulders, on both the shoulders, the bending of his Arms, and the Crown of his Head: whereupon the Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi> closed the Loops, and the Lord Arch-bishop said several Prayers; which ended, the Coif was put on His Majesties Head, and the <hi>Colobium syndonis</hi> or <hi>Dalmatica,</hi> then the <hi>Super-tunica</hi> of cloth of Gold, with the <hi>Tissue buskins</hi> and <hi>Sandals</hi> of the same; then the Spurs were put on by the Peer that carried them: then the Arch-bishop took the Kings Sword and laid it on the Communion-Table, and after Prayer restored it to the King, which was Girt upon him by the Lord great Chamberlain: then the Armil was put on, next the Mantle, or open Pall; after which, the Lord Arch-bishop took the Crown into his hands, and laid it on the Communion-Table, Prayed, and then set it on the Kings Head; whereupon, all the Peers put on their Coronets and Caps, the Choire singing an Anthem: next, the Arch-Bishop took the Kings Ring, prayed again, and put it on the Fourth Finger of the Kings Hand; after which his Majesty took off his Sword, and offered it up; which the Lord great Chamberlain redeemed, drew it out, and carried it naked before the King. Then the Arch-Bishop took the Scepter with the Cross, and delivered it into His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties right Hand, the Rod with the Dove in the left; and the King kneeling, blessed him: which done, the King ascended his Throne Royal, the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal attending him, where after <hi>Te Deum</hi> the King was again Enthroned, and then all the Peers did their Homage; The Arch-Bishop first, who then kissed the Kings left Cheek, and after him the other Bishops. After their Homage, the Peers all together stood round about the King, and every one in their order toucht the Crown upon his Head, promising their readiness to support it with their power. The Coronation being ended, the Communion

followed, which his Majesty having received and offered, returned to his Throne till the Communion ended, and then went into St. <hi>Edwards Chappel,</hi> there took off his Crown, and delivered it to the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who laid it upon the Communion-Table: which done, the King withdrew into a Traverse, where the Lord great Chamberlain of <hi>England</hi> disrobed the King of St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Robes,</hi> and delivered them to the Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> then His Majesty was newly arrayed with his Robes prepared for that day, and came to the Communion-Table in St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Chappel,</hi> where the Lord Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for the Arch-Bishop, set the Crown Imperial, provided for the King to wear that day, upon his Head. Then His Majesty took the Scepter and the Rod, and (the Train set in order before him) went up to the Throne, and so through the Choyre and body of the Church out at the West-door, to the Palace of <hi>Westminster.</hi>

                        <p>Which read aloud, the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> presented the King with a Guilt Cup fill'd with Wine; who drank to his Champion, and sent him the said Cup by the said Earl; which after three Reverences, and some steps backward, he drunk off, and kept it as his Fee, and departed.</p>

And in all ancient Augury, such signes were taken for the most auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, however the mad remnant of the Rebellion would have it parallell'd to <hi>Saul</hi>'s inauguration, never considering the season, nor the different occasion and case between the most ancient Kingly Right and descent in <hi>Christendom,</hi> and that a new Title and Government in <hi>Iewry,</hi> which had before the most special presence of God among them.</p>

                        <p>From these Glories of the Crown, we are next invited to as Illustrious, those of Chivalry, a medium betwixt War and Peace, that there might be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that his Majesties Fortunes could not comprehend. The most Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order of the Garter, Famous for its Martial and Civil Atchievements, had been drag'd in the Dirt, and trampled under Foot of <hi>Plebeian Anarchy</hi> and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation; when the innocent charm of its Motto, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ni soit qui mal y pense, Evil be to him that Evil thinks,</hi> which had preserved it so many Ages, found not veneration nor respect, being ridled by that Monster of Rebellion, to be a badge and significator of its certain, though long-look'd-for <hi>Vltion and Avengement,</hi> in its own dire Retorts, and self-punishing Revolutions.</p>
                        <p>It is not, nor ever will be forgotten, how they abased this Royal Ensigne, the highest Order of Knighthood in the World, when it was derided by the most abject and meanest degree of the People; when its <hi>True Blue</hi> was stained with the Blot of Faintise and imbecility of courage, till another Saint <hi>George</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose to be its Champion, Assertor, and Restorer of its Renown and Glory.</p>
                        <p>Some of these most Honourable Knights survived his Majesties Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; some he made abroad, others he decreed so; and they were so <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> having had the Order sent them, but the Investiture wanting. The rest of these Noble Companions were allied to the Restoration; all of them are ranked in the manner as they sate at <hi>Windsor,</hi> April 16. 1662, being St. <hi>George</hi> his day; where after the usual Magnificent Procession, His Majesty renewed the usual Solemnities and Grandeurs thereof; Himself being there in Person.</p>

                        <p>In this Consistency the King was desirous to meet this Illustrious Body in Parliament, to close those distances and separations, and redintegrate the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affections, endearments, and natural kindnesses, which the unnaturalness and perverse malignity of the times had by our Divisions abrupted and hitherto discontinued: the King had promised so much at the Dissolution of the late Free-Parliament or Convention, and accordingly issued out His Writ, (soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) for their sitting down the Eighth of <hi>May</hi> (a little before which,<note place="margin">

In these Elections it appeared how much a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or those Actions which were pretended to be done by the People in Parliament (by a few modulers thereof) were ever approved; for not such a man had a Voyce, and the Election of the Free Parliament gave little Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to stand for it: the main stickling was between the Episcopal and Presbyterian Parties; and even that numerous Party (as was said by themselves) found how much they were mistaken in the Suffrages of the Kingdome, when under no awe, nor in the phrensy of misguised Zeal: several Letters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted from the chief Ministers of that Perswasion, exhorting their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondents to do their utmost for favourable Elections to their Discipline, and that very confidently, after the choyce made at <hi>London,</hi> of persons the most of them of their way. But nevertheless, that there might not the least remain of

the Government be left unjustified and unreared; it so happened, that far the major part of this House of Commons were not better affected to the Peace of the Kingdome, than to the Restauration and Settlement of the Church.</p>
                        <p>To this Parliament the King with his Nobles, according to the splendid cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of opening these grand Assemblies, rode in State and Triumph: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so full a Narrative of such Glory hath already preceded, I will not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dazile the Reader. The House being met, the King sent for the Commons into the House of Lords, where most obligingly he declared, <hi>His content in meeting them; most of them being known to him:</hi> that he was as confident, as of any thing whatsoever, that it would be a happy Parliament; and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, acquainted them with his Resolution of marrying the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which Match (he said) he had proposed to his Privy Council, and they had every one highly approved it; that he thought none of them would willingly have him live and dye a Batchelour, and therefore he had newly made and signed a Treaty with the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> by his Ambassadour <hi>Don Francisco De Mello</hi> here Resident,<note place="margin">Portugal <hi>Match mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the King to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                           </note> and now upon departure with the same Treaty, in which this Article of Marriage was inserted. And then my Lord Chancellour, by His Order, gave the Parliament a further Account of His Majesties calling them. Sir <hi>Edward Turner</hi> the Dukes Attourney General was chosen Speaker for the House of Commons; who in his Speech to the King expressed the hopes of the Commons, that as His Majesty had manifested his great Indulgence to that Adopted, so that he had a Blessing left for this his Natural Parliament. These Ceremonies being over, wherein the dutiful respects of the Houses an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the favour and affection of the King; the Parliament proceeded to the Affairs of the Kingdome. Near that very time, a Parliament began in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (after a like happy Convention had been by his Majesties Order, from their Adjournment upon his Restitution, reassembled in that quality) Sir <hi>Audly Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> being chosen Speaker. The Convocation of the <hi>English</hi> Clergy, all emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and most learned pious Persons, met on the sixteenth of <hi>May</hi> at <hi>Westminster.</hi> And the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> his Majesties Aunt, from a long absence of forty eight years;<note place="margin">

                     <p>Her Majesty Queen <hi>Catharina</hi> was now expected to be at Sea, and therefore his Majesty came to the Parliament and acquainted them with the same, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired that as a Complement to her, they would cause the Highways and Streets of <hi>London</hi> to be fitted and cleansed against her reception, and to make what hast with convenience they could, with the dispatch of those Bills under their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.

                        <hi>Portugal,</hi> by almost as miraculous a Turn as that of our Captivity by the Kings Restitution. So Providence was pleased to adapt and fit both these Princes Conditions and Estates to this happy juncture of them in this Royal and happy Estate.</p>
                     <p>This was designed by King <hi>Iohn</hi> in the beginning of our Troubles, and of his Reign; and was one of the first Acts of State he did with us, managed here by <hi>Don Antonio de Souza</hi> his Embassadour hither, who was very instrumental in transacting His late Majesties Affairs of Forraign Concernments, receiving and returning his Dispatches. One Ingredient no doubt in point of Civility and Honour, among those other of Affection and Interest, that make up this Princely Match. These were something, as also his Majesties reflection on his Personal picque with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had very much disobliged him in the time of the Usurpation, by courting and owning his Rebels, to satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of some pretended injuries done him by his Grandfather and Father, by loss of his <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet in the <hi>Downs,</hi> which the King had a most inviting opportunity here to remember.</p>
                     <p>Upon the return of the <hi>Conde de Mello,</hi> as aforesaid, with the Articles of Treaty and Marriage to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> they were presently noysed about the City, and more loudly reported from all the Cannon in the River, both <hi>Portuges</hi> and Forraigners; by which means, without further Proclamation, it was publick about the Town; who like over-joyed People, betook themselves to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentest, yet most solemn de monstrations thereof, by Bonfires and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Streets resounding with Healths, <hi>al Re del Grand Brettanna</hi>; which continued that Night and the next Day.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, by an Express from <hi>England</hi> from the King to her, she was Complemented with the Stile of Queen of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; which put that Court into a new Splendor, both to her Retinue and Attendance; and all Honours and Duties done her, as if she were actually Crowned. It will not be much mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to insist on all the other particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> those several Messages sent and returned betwixt those two Royal Lovers, together with the intercourse betwixt the Two Crowns in point of Alliance and Security; nor the numerous resort of the <hi>English</hi> every day to Worship this Sun of the East, and pay their Early Devotions to her: It will be more unnecessary to relate those Romances and Fictions made by the Phanatick Crew at Home, that there were a Fleet of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> that lay ready in her way to intercept her Passage into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>

A while after that, the Gentlemans Servant, a <hi>Portugueze</hi> likewise, called <hi>Peter Caesar,</hi> came down and sate to Dinner with the people of the house, where he staid most part of the afternoon; and then went abroad, and came in again. Toward the evening he went forth another time, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Porter to bring home a large Chest, which being carried up stairs, the Boy drew it into his Masters Chamber; and a good while after, called the Porter to help him down with it, which he did accordingly. But the Chest proving too heavy for the Porter and the Youth, another Porter was call'd, and so they carried it away to the water-side; where it was put into a Boat, and the Boy bidding the Water-man cross the water, pretending he was to receive mony for the Goods in the Chest, from a person that was to meet him there, staid a while; but no body coming, at length in a rage to see himself disappointed, caus'd the fellow to row him back again, and by the way slipp'd the Chest into the <hi>Thames,</hi> and left it as in a fury to see himself sent of an Errand to so little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. After this, the Boy returned to his Masters Lodging; but some blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discovered upon the stairs, the fellow was apprehended: next morning the Chest being taken up and opened, there was found the body of his Master shot through the head. That which moved him to this horrid Villany, was a sum of mony, between 3 and 400 hundred pound, which his Master wore about him in a List. He was afterwards condemn'd, and executed at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>

                        <p>That which was most remarkable this Year in Forein parts,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Cessation of Arms between the</hi> Turk <hi>and</hi> Emperor.</note> besides what we have already related as they fell in time, that is to say, the two great Victories obtain'd against the <hi>Turk</hi> by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> was the Cessation of War that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued thereupon; of great Concernment, not only to those Empires, but to all Christendom; a solemn Peace not long after ensuing.</p>
                        <p>The City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was so fatal to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> then reigning,<note place="margin">Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>leaves</hi> Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> that he resolv'd to make this Year to be not a little fatal to it, by withdrawing his Court and presence from thence; and that with so much indignation against the Place, that he vow'd he would rather set fire to it with his own hands, than return to it again: whereupon he retired to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> a place seated fit for his Sports of Hawking and Hunting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Divertisements that made him seek Peace rather than War.</p>
                        <p>But the joy of this Cessation was not a little disturb'd by the death of Count <hi>Serini</hi>;<note place="margin">Sireni <hi>kill'd.</hi>
                           </note> who being upon the chase of a Boar, and seeing the Beast likely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, quitted his Company, and follow'd him single; till coming near him, he fired his Pistol at him. The Boar finding himself wounded, furiously rush'd upon the Count, and then with four deadly wounds, the first in the neck, the next in the head, the third in his belly, and the fourth in his foot, tore him up, and dispatch'd him.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>French</hi> this Year had a mind to get some footing in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and to that end got possession of a small Sea-port Town or Fort,<note place="margin">

The <hi>Moors</hi> in one Assault they made upon it this year, lost six hundred men; the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> being wounded on the <hi>French</hi> side. In which posture we shall leave them for this Year: Only it is not to be forgotten, that the Great <hi>Turk</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the Battle of <hi>Leweniz,</hi> and the surprize of <hi>Gigery,</hi> caus'd all the <hi>French</hi> which he found in his Dominions to be put to death.</p>

This Commotion was rais'd, upon a pretence that the Vice-Legat went about to impose something upon them, against the Liberty of the Inhabitants. But ot length, by mediation of their Archbishop, they were brought to terms of accommodation, upon condition that the <hi>Italian</hi> Garrison

should depart the Town and Country, and the <hi>Italian</hi> Provost with his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers be banisht for ever out of their Territories.

                        </note> they insinuated into the ears and minds of the people, That the King of <hi>England</hi> was not in a condition to set out a Fleet; which they not only found to be otherwise, but also purely done upon the stock of his own proper

Authority and Credit. When they saw that brought to pass, the next thing they flatter'd the people withal, was, that though the King had strain'd himself to bring a Fleet to Sea, yet that the Parliament would never supply him with a sum of Mony answerable to the Charge of so expensive a War. Finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves deluded therein also, by their Act for the Royal Aid; the next suggestion was, that the people would never submit to pay it. But the voluntary Present made to his Majesty by the City of <hi>London,</hi> soon clear'd that mistake. To these they added, that they should find friends in <hi>England,</hi> together with great Aid and Support from Forein Princes; wherein they found themselves at length to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally disappointed.</p>
                     <p>Among the rest of their disappointments, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s calling in all his Seamen out of Forein Service, was not the least; for thereby they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished of many able Sea-men, which otherwise they might have had for their Mony.</p>

They were sent upon Mediation and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; the event whereof the <hi>Dutch</hi> did much depend upon, and extremely hearken after.</p>
                     <p>Nor were the <hi>Dutch</hi> a little active,<note place="margin">Dutch <hi>Libel against the</hi> English.</note> in hopes to deceive Forein Princes, in Printing and publishing Libels, to the scandal and defamation of the <hi>English</hi> Nation. Among others, the most remarkable of their Papers were, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of the Deputies of the States General, upon the Memorial of Sir</hi> George Downing, <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> &amp;c. A Discourse full of irreverence and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of which the world was sufficiently convinc'd, when they read the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> thereto.</p>
                     <p>In the next place,<note place="margin">Valkenburghs <hi>Letter.</hi>
                        </note> they Printed a pretended Letter from one <hi>Valkenburgh,</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector-General of <hi>Guinee</hi> to the States, feigning how that at <hi>Adia,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> after they had given quarter, with rusty Knives cut off the Noses of those whom they had taken alive, and exercised many other strange <hi>Amboyna</hi>-cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in these parts.</p>

                     <p>After this, Captain <hi>Holmes,</hi> for the better security of some <hi>English</hi> Ships dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected, sailed to <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> fearing one <hi>Iohnson,</hi> that was said to lie in the way; where without any provocation, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At <hi>Sestos</hi> they had been dealing with the King of that place to throw out the <hi>English,</hi> inveigling the people abroad, and then abusing them under <hi>English</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the better to attain their ends.</p>
                     <p>The like was done upon the Coast of Castle <hi>de Mina,</hi> where <hi>Valckenburgh</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a Bendy of Gold for every <hi>English</hi> head.</p>
                     <p>At another time they shot at a Convoy of Capt. <hi>Holmes</hi> from a Fort of theirs; which so enrag'd the <hi>Moors,</hi> that they fell upon the Fort, and took it, and would have put all the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to the Sword, had not the Captain prevented them.</p>

But then the English Admiral with his own ship bore up to the whole Fleet of the Enemy, and sent out a Fire-ship, which had wrought her self very neer one of the Enemies greatest Men of War, being stoutly seconded by the Man of War; but being gall'd by the shot of the whole Fleet, they thought it convenient to come off.

                        <p>A Gentleman of <hi>Savoy,</hi> having his Head cut off at <hi>Geneva,</hi> for some Crime committed there; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did so exceedingly resent their Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, (which he affirm'd to be both against the last Treaty between that City and him, and against the Law of Nations) that he was resolv'd to employ his Arms against them. The City of <hi>Geneva</hi> appeal'd to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who in a Dyet at <hi>Baden,</hi> as well of the Roman-Catholicks as Protestants, where were also present the Embassadors of the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously resolv'd to give their Assistance to <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Emperour's Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador declar'd the like in the Name of his Master, who was oblig'd to protect <hi>Geneva</hi> as an Imperial City, being unjustly assaulted by a Prince of the Empire. The Spanish Embassador deliver'd himself also in their favour.</p>
                        <p>But the main Affair which alarm'd the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> was the pretension which the King of <hi>France</hi> made to the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> and his great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to get the possession of what he laid claim to, by force of Arms. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle-Rodrigo</hi> represented to the King of <hi>France</hi> the scandal which would be given

                           </gap>ore left it to his consideration how unjust it would be to attempt any Invasion without those Formalities and Interpositions which the Christian Princes had always observed.</p>
                        <p>Of this the King of <hi>France</hi> takes little notice: for he thought he had done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough a little before, by his Letter to the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein he wrote to her, that she could not but know the right which the Queen his Wife had to several Territories of the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which she knowing to be solid, had desir'd her Majesty to take particular Cognizance of, and do her Justice therein. That she in her Answer had not only pretended that she could not upon any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Affair enter into a discussion thereof, but had sent Orders to the Governour of <hi>Flanders</hi> to administer the Oath of Fidelity to be administred to all the States and People of that Country; which being an absolute refusal of doing him Justice, had put him upon a necessity of being wanting to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to himself, to his Queen, and the <hi>Dolphin</hi> his Son, should he not by force of Arms endeavour to obtain that reason which had been denied him.</p>
                        <p>The Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> returns for Answer, that the King of <hi>France</hi> could not be ignorant of the just Rights of the King her Son: however, that she was willing to enter into an Amicable Treaty, wherein the Rights of her Son and Him might be seasonably examin'd, so that Justice might take place by the ways and means most proper.</p>
                        <p>But the King of <hi>France,</hi> not liking these delays of Words, falls into the Spanish Territories in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and takes <hi>Tournay, Doway, Bergen</hi> St. <hi>Winox, Courtrich, Oudenard,</hi> and <hi>Lille</hi>; and almost wholly reduces those parts under his Jurisdiction: and besides all this, he defeats a great part of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Army under <hi>Marcin,</hi> killing 2000 upon the place, and pursuing the rest to the very Walls of <hi>Damin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the other side, he sends the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> with a Body of 8000 men, to secure <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and to prevent any Succours that the Emperour might send: And hearing that his Forces were upon their March, commanded the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as Generalissimo of that place, to send a supply to <hi>Crequi</hi> to lie in their way.</p>
                        <p>Toward the latter end of the Year, he fell into <hi>Franche Comte,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> took <hi>Bessanson, Dole, Gray, Besterans, Rochefort,</hi> and so many other places, that by the latter end of <hi>February</hi> the Conquest of that place was wholly compleated.</p>
                        <p>Though the <hi>Swedes</hi> stood firm to <hi>England</hi> during the War, yet now that the King of <hi>England</hi> had concluded a Peace with the Dutch, they also did the same.</p>
                        <p>The chief Conditions of the Treaty were, <hi>That</hi> Swedeland <hi>should give up all their pretensions upon account of the Fort</hi> Cabo Corso <hi>in</hi> Guiny, <hi>and the Ship</hi> Christina.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the</hi> Swedes <hi>should give up all their Rights to the</hi> East-Indies, <hi>and neither directly nor indirectly sail into those Coasts upon the account of Trade; For which the King of</hi> Sweden <hi>should receive from the Dutch the sum of</hi> 140000 <hi>Crowns.</hi>

                           <hi>France</hi> may be thought to have no kindness for the Jesuits; however, the most Christian King could not be said to do amiss, not to let 'um Triumph over their Superiors: for Complaint being made, that the Jesuits in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess of <hi>Fambers</hi> had refus'd to give Obedience to the Bishop of that Diocess, the King gave leave to the Bishop to proceed against them by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, according to the Priviledges of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church: whereupon, the Bishop suspended them from all their Functions, forbidding them to Preach, Teach, or Confess any person, within the Territories of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> being now Master of several Towns of <hi>Flanders,</hi> late under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and having totally reduc'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Burgundy</hi> under his Subjection; of which, in favour of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he immediately granted two Reversions, one to the Duke <hi>D' Enguien</hi> Son of the said Prince, and the other to the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> his Grand-Child; thought it convenient to listen to the Mediation then proffer'd by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes of <hi>Europe</hi>; chiefly, by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Netherlands</hi>: so that a Treaty was concluded upon, and <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> appointed the Place for the Commissioners to meet in.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lay upon their Demurs, a League was Concluded by the Mediation of the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands</hi> Embassador at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> between the two Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>; a League of sincere and perpetual Peace, containing a Release of Prisoners, Nullity of Confiscations, Freedom of Commerce; and such other Usual Articles: which were in Six Months after Publication, to be Confirm'd and Ratifi'd by the King of Great <hi>Britain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now, as if the General Design of <hi>Europe</hi> were Peace, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners meet at <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi>; for the King of <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>; for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beverning</hi>; for the <hi>French,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Colbert</hi>; for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Bergeick</hi>; who having some time before Sign'd Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Articles, in order to a final Conclusion, whereby a suspension of Arms was granted, and the March of the <hi>French</hi> Army Countermanded; at length, fell seriously to their Work, so that by the second of <hi>May,</hi> the Articles of General Peace were sign'd by the Plenipotentiaries of both Kings; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, Proclaim'd through all the Chief places of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>; to the general content of <hi>Europe,</hi> and satisfaction of the Mediators.</p>
                        <p>But notwithstanding this fair Peace, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not like the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the <hi>French</hi>; and therefore would have made an Exchange of some other Territories of theirs lying farther off, for that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>Now for varieties sake, and to shew there was some Justice at <hi>Rome,</hi> I must not omit an Act of the Pope at this time raigning: A Complaint being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to his Holiness, by a person of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> that whereas he had liv'd seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years with his Mother, with great content and satisfaction, upon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of 1500 Dollars <hi>per Annum</hi>; His Mother falling sick, was during her sickness so far prevail'd upon by a Jesuit, her Confessor, that she had by Will given away all the Estate to the Order, not reserving any thing for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of him (her Son). The Pope extreamly dissatisfi'd with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, sent for his own Confessor, and in very severe Language commanded him to finde out the General, and in his Name to require him to write to the Superior at <hi>Tivoli</hi> to restore the Petitioner his Land again.</p>
                        <p>Nor must we omit, now we are at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Canonization of an <hi>American</hi> Virgin, named <hi>Rosa,</hi> a Nun in a Covent of St. <hi>Dominick:</hi> For every body in <hi>England</hi> does not understand, what a glorious thing it is to be made a Saint. The Church was hung with Tapistry, and Inscriptions, in honour of the New Saint; on the Altar stood her Image; and about it, the Arms of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Peru,</hi> and this Religious Dominican. During the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> one of the Cannons of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church was fir'd, a great number of Drums and Trumpets sounding, and several Vollies of shot given by a Squadron of <hi>Germans,</hi> drawn up neer the Church. After which, a solemn Mass was sung, by six Quires of Musick. In the Afternoon, the Pope heard Vespers in the same Church, present several Cardinals, with the Embassadors and Ministers of Forrein Princes; and the Evening spent in Lights and Fire-works.</p>

The King therein recommended three things more especially to them; the one was Unity among themselves, the Union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Supply of his present and urgent Necessities. As to the differences among themselves, they were, as soon as sate, buried in oblivion, and all matter of prejudice threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby as suddenly vanish'd: For they were no sooner sate, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Majesty's Recommendation, both Houses came to a full agreement in the matter in debate between 'um, greatly to the encouragement of all that regarded the good of the Nation, as by the effect of their unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations soon after appeared.</p>

                        <p>The Treaty at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> one would have thought, should have brought a general repose to <hi>Europe</hi>; but jealousies of State had interrupted the quiet that should have attended upon it. The King of <hi>France</hi>'s new demands of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies to his Conquests in <hi>Flanders</hi> startled the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; whereby Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions were exacted by the French from places under the Spanish Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as they took it for granted: Nor did the States of <hi>Holland</hi> care at all for their Neighbourhood.

                        <p>These Complaints the King of <hi>France</hi> eludes, by renouncing his pretensions in one place, and claiming in another; quitting <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and claiming <hi>Ipre</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quitting <hi>Conde,</hi> and claiming <hi>Oudenard</hi>: in which contests the Commissioners at <hi>Lille</hi> having spent many Moneths in vain, were at length forc'd to break off without doing any thing. On the other side, <hi>Pompone</hi> the French Embassador endeavours all that might be to assure the States of <hi>Holland</hi> of the great incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the King his Master to entertain all Friendship and good Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with them; telling them, that he doubted not but the cares which he had for the glory of Christendom, would in time sufficiently convince 'um of the vanity of those fears which some did endeavour to sow amongst 'um.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the States prepar'd for the security of their Frontiers, and gave particular order to fortifie several Towns of <hi>Overyssel,</hi> and upon the Borders of <hi>Westphalia.</hi> In this juncture of time came news that the King of <hi>France</hi> had laid double Impositions upon the Manufactures of <hi>Holland</hi>; in recompence of which kindness, the Dutch lay an Imposition upon French Wine and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; proceeding at length to do the same upon all French Wares, and forbid ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely the Importation of Brandy and all other Distill'd Waters into <hi>Holland</hi>: and upon this fuel, those silent Animosities fed, which afterwards brake out into greater Flames.</p>
                        <p>But between the States and <hi>Portugal</hi> there began to be a better understanding, a new League being made betwixt them, with condition that <hi>Cochin</hi> and <hi>Cono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> should remain to the Dutch, and that four Millions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, due to the States, should be paid according to the Agreement made between them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> in <hi>Candy</hi> had held out a long while against the main force of the <hi>Turk,</hi> being assisted by many Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> especially the French, first under the Command of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> but with ill success, he being slain in a Salley; after him, under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi>; who after many Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and attempts, finding little good to be done, with what Souldiers he had left, deserts the Garrison, and returns for <hi>France,</hi> though not without some disgrace to his person: for the King of <hi>France</hi> hearing of his being landed,

commanded him to retire to his own possessions, forbidding him to see his Face. The <hi>Venetian</hi> seeing no hopes of keeping the Town any longer, surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it upon Articles, and at length concluded a Peace inviolable for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Trade, and mutual quiet of both Subjects.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Casimire</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> having resign'd, and being now retired into <hi>France</hi>; after many debates, and much contention, one <hi>Wisnowiskie,</hi> a Native, and one of the chief Nobility, was the Elected King, being Crown'd in <hi>September,</hi> and soon after Married to <hi>Eleanor</hi> Sister to the Emperour of <hi>Germany.</hi>

                        <p>The first occurrence of Moment, is the Election of the new Pope, Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> who at first refus'd the Honour; but the perswasion of the Cardinals prevailing, he told them, <hi>they had open'd upon Him the Gates of Hell</hi>; and so yielded to their importunity. He had no Nephews, and therefore Adopted Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> whose Brother had Married his Neece.</p>
                        <p>And now the Grandeur of the House of <hi>Orange</hi> began to revive again; The <hi>States</hi> Concluding in a full Assembly, his admission into the Council of State; and setling an honourable Pension upon him: Nor was he long without the Title of their Captain General by Sea and Land.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Flanders,</hi> some Alteration happen'd, by reason that the <hi>Constable of Castile</hi> growing sickly, could not abide the trouble of business any longer; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted privately to <hi>Ostend,</hi> and so by Sea for <hi>Spain:</hi> in his place the <hi>Count de Monterey</hi> was soon advanced.</p>
                        <p>While <hi>Tangier</hi> makes us concern'd with the <hi>Moors,</hi> our nearest Neighbours, we must not omit the Actions of those people, whose Losses and Successes are to be narrowly observ'd by the <hi>English</hi>; either their Allyes, or Enemies. <hi>Taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi> therefore having Intelligence that the people of <hi>Suz</hi> had united their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with those of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> march'd toward the farther part of <hi>Suz,</hi> with an Army of 140000 Men, which at first so Terrified those people, that they presented him with their Leaders Head, and with great submission begg'd his Pardon. In confidence of this, <hi>Taffalette</hi> Marches toward <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi>; but the people Repenting of what they had done, underhand renew'd a League with the Governor of that Town; and unexpectedly setting upon the Army of <hi>Taffalette,</hi> quite routed it, and slew <hi>Taffalet</hi>'s Brother who led the Van, himself only escaping with four Horse: but being soon recruited, he return'd to <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> and took it, and in a short while recover'd what he had so unadvisedly lost.</p>
                        <p>But that which made the greatest noise in the World, was the suddain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of <hi>Loraine,</hi> by the King of <hi>France.</hi> For the surprise of which Country Marshal <hi>Crequi</hi> being sent with a great Army, he over-ran the Country like a mighty Torrent: insomuch, that by the beginning of <hi>Winter</hi> there was scarce a Town in <hi>Lorraine</hi> that was not at the <hi>French</hi> Devotion. The designe of the King of <hi>France</hi> was to lay aside the old Duke, and confer the Dutchy on Prince <hi>Charles</hi>; on condition that he should raise the Fortifications of <hi>Chastel</hi> and <hi>Espinal,</hi> and give up to the King the Marquisate of <hi>Nomende.</hi> Certain it was, the King of <hi>France</hi> did send to the said Prince, then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to offer him the Possession of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> on condition he would hold it of him, and to maintain no greater Number of Forces than he should think fit; telling him withal, that he were best have a care, that upon his refusal, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> did not accept of it upon the same terms.</p>
                        <p>The old Duke thus outed of all, wandred up and down from place to place, begging Ayd of the Neighbouring Princes; who promis'd fair, but did little more, than come to a conditional Agreement for the raysing Forces for the common good and safety of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>This Alarm'd not only the <hi>Dutch</hi> on the one side, but the <hi>Switzers</hi> on the other; the Effect of which was, that it made them both careful to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the best posture of Defence they might.</p>
                        <p>While this part of <hi>Europe</hi> is thus preparing for Mischief, we find <hi>Russia</hi> over-whelm'd with an Inundation of Rebellion; where one <hi>Stephen Radskin</hi> a Tumultuous Ring-leader, having Poyson'd the Rabble with the fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Liberty, the common motives to Insurrection, of a small Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, grew to a mountainous Number; and having seiz'd the great Kingdoms of <hi>Astracan</hi> and <hi>Casan,</hi> and got into his Possession the Treasures of the Great

Whereupon, the Duke finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self near the <hi>Oyster-Bank,</hi> Tack'd about, stood away some Leagues, and came to an Anchor: there he staid all Night, and the next Morning till Ten a Clock, but could hear nothing of the Enemy; who were retir'd to the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of their own Coast.

The <hi>Katharine</hi> was taken, and the Captain put on Board a <hi>Dutch</hi> ship, and the Men clapt under Hatches, the <hi>Dutch</hi> going about to Fire the ship, at what time a <hi>French</hi> Sloop came in, and cut away the Fireships Boat; and then the <hi>English</hi> finding a way to break out upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> redeem'd both themselves and the ship, and brought away Sixteen of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Prisoners, that were a little before their Masters.</p>

                     <p>The Dutch had, no question, promised themselves great matters from the Emperour; but there was nothing appear'd to give them any hopes, till at length a general Treaty was concluded for the publick Security and general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Empire, at <hi>Ratisbone</hi>; which though it prov'd slow, as passing three Colledges, That of the Electors, That of the Princes, and That of the Free-Towns; yet after this Conclusion, the Imperial Forces being upon their march from one side, and the <hi>Brandenburgher</hi> on the other, to make a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Frontiers of the Enemy,<note place="margin">

their motion, with the rest falls in with <hi>De Ruyter</hi> upon the Prince; nor did the French when they had got the Wind come up to his assistance, onely <hi>Martel</hi> with much courage stood by him. As for <hi>Tromp</hi> fiercely bearing up upon <hi>Sprague</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was as undauntedly receiv'd by <hi>Sprague,</hi> who slackned his Sails in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; which the rest of the Squadron observing, it fell out that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this means separated, the Squadrons could not relieve one another as they should have done. The courage of both Captains was equal, and their desire of Glory the same.

Tromp</hi> still engag'd with <hi>Sprague; Tromp</hi>'s Second with the Earl of <hi>Ossory.</hi> In the Afternoon <hi>Sprague</hi> lay by to repair his Rigging; but his ship being at the same time disabled by two unhappy shot, he left the Vessel, and taking the Flag along with him, hasts to the St. <hi>George,</hi> and puts up the Flag; which when the Earl of <hi>Ossory</hi> saw, who had in the mean time brought new Foresails to his Yards, he sent <hi>Norborough</hi> to tell him, that if he would, he would set upon <hi>Tromp,</hi> and board him if he had assistance: <hi>Sprague</hi> praises his resolution, bids him go on, and he would immediately be with him. But his suddain death was the loss of a Noble Designe: For he had not been long aboard the St. <hi>George,</hi> when through the loss of her Main-mast he was forc'd to forsake her too; and as he was going aboard the <hi>Royal Charles,</hi> the Boat being shatter'd to pieces by an accidental shot, he was himself drown'd in the Ocean, over which he had so often Triumph'd.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Sprague</hi>'s ship had lost her Masts, <hi>Tromp</hi> confident of carrying her, bore up briskly and gave her a Broad-side, and brought up two Fire-ships, but all in vain; for as he pass'd by, he was so severely gall'd by the Earl of <hi>Ossory,</hi> that he had hardly time to discharge six of his own Guns: Neither did the Earl of <hi>Ossory</hi> leave the Flag-ship till he saw her tow'd off by the <hi>Hampshire. Tromp</hi> sufficiently wearied, having got his Squadron together, at first retir'd; but when he saw <hi>De Ruyter</hi> coming toward him, he stay'd. By and by the Prince was to be discern'd a far off with his Squadron, who had born the brunt of the <hi>Zealand</hi>-Squadron and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> all the day; for the French, having gain'd the Wind in the beginning of the Fight, never came in; but at two of the clock the Prince and <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> as it were by consent, seem'd to leave off: for both being sollicitous for the rest of their Fleets, whom they saw afar off, sail'd peaceably, and directed their course toward their Friends, though all the while within Cannon-shot. But now <hi>De Ruyter</hi> being joyn'd with his own, falls upon the Blue, endeavouring to separate that Squadron from the Prince; but in vain, the Prince making all haste to come in, and the other seasonably joyning with him. Then began a most sharp dispute on both sides, at what time the Prince sending two Fire-ships, guarded by Captain <hi>Leg,</hi> upon the Enemy, put them into such a confusion, that had the French then come in, being, as they were, Masters of the Wind, the Dispute with the Dutch concerning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea had certainly been at an end.</p>
                     <p>The Dutch lost two Flag-Officers, several Captains, and about 1000 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seamen. Among the English, <hi>Sprague</hi> was much lamented, Captain <hi>Neve</hi> was slain, <hi>Reeves</hi> and <hi>Heywood</hi> died of their Wounds. Of the French, but one Commander slain. The loss of Common English Seamen was not so great, being chiefly in the Earl of <hi>Ossory</hi>'s and Sir <hi>Edward Sprague</hi>'s ships.</p>
                     <p>About the middle of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> of <hi>Chudleigh</hi> resign'd his Staff as Lord-Treasurer into the King's hands, and Sir <hi>Thomas Osborn,</hi> created Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Osborn</hi> of <hi>Dumblaine</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was made Lord-Treasurer in his room.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Soon after, His Majesty was pleas'd to call before him in Council the two Lord Chief-Justices, and the Lord Chief-Baron, commanding them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the most effectual means for putting the Laws in Execution for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the growth of Popery; and at the same time ordered, that no Roman-Catholick, or so reputed, should presume after the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> to come into his presence, to his Palace, or where his Court should be: and the Lord-Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Lord-Chamberlain of the Houshold, were ordered to see the same effectually put in execution. And by further Order a little after, forbid them to come neer St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s House, or into the Park.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after, in pursuance of his Gracious Assurance to both Houses of Parliament, His Majesty issued out his Royal Proclamation to the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, further requiring the Judges, and all Justices of the Peace, to take effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care for the prosecution of all Papists and Popish Recusants, according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>About the latter end of <hi>November</hi> the Dutchess of <hi>Modena</hi> arriving at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> in order to her Intermarriage with his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was there met by the Duke; and some few days after, coming from <hi>Gravesend</hi> to <hi>London</hi> by Water, was by his Majesty and divers of the Nobility met in Barges upon the River, and so conducted to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where, after her Royal Highness had been received in the most obliging and kinde manner by her Majesty, she was conducted to St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s. Within few days after, their Royal Highnesses gave Audience to the <hi>French, Portugal, Swedish,</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Embassadors, as likewise to the Residents of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Newburgh,</hi> who all went to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them upon their late Marriage.</p>
                     <p>About this time his Majesty (the great numbers of extraordinary Servants that had been sworn and admitted into his Service, who making use of the Protections they receiv'd thereby, did obstruct the due course of Law) issued forth an Order in Council, whereby all persons that did not by vertue of their Places receive Fee, Wages, Salary, Diet, or Board-wages, should be absolutely disabled from making use of any Protection whatsoever, for the future, to save them from the prosecution of their Creditors.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Tangier</hi> came Intelligence, that the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi> Governour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the defeat and death of <hi>Gayland,</hi> and the great success of <hi>Muly Ishmael</hi> in those parts; and having receiv'd a kinde Letter from the said <hi>Muly Ishmael,</hi> purporting his great desire to be in Amity with the Governour, and a proposition of sending Commissioners to treat with him; accordingly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Major <hi>White,</hi> Alderman <hi>Read,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wollaston</hi> for that purpose, with full power and Instructions to conclude a Peace and Treaty of Commerce, and particularly for the Redemption of the Captives in <hi>Sally</hi>; wherein the Earl doubted not the same success as he had had with <hi>Gayland</hi> above a year before; with whom he had made so firm a Peace, that the Moors and Inhabitants of <hi>Tangier</hi> convers'd together as if they had been one Nation.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the vigour and fury of the War, yet neither in the height of this years Preparation nor Action, were the thoughts of Peace laid aside; but rather all endeavours tending thereto vigorously pursued. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, a Treaty was concluded on between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the Dutch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereat the Allies of both Parties were to be present. The place accepted of by the King of <hi>England</hi> was <hi>Cologne,</hi> whither by the middle of Summer, and some before, came all the Plenipotentiaries of the several Confederates.

                     <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Dutch</hi> send a Letter to the King of <hi>England</hi>; to which, the King of <hi>England</hi> return'd so full an Answer, that though they said, <hi>The King was very sharp and obstinate in his Letter</hi>: That nothing was to be done, but to continue the War: That no farther Instructions should be sent to their Deputies at <hi>Cologne,</hi> till they saw how the Parliament would order matters, to whom they were resolv'd to send a Copy of their Reasonable Proposals, hoping otherwise to bring the King to better Termes: Yet upon cooler thoughts, they not only listned to the Motions of Peace, but also came to terms of Accommodation: and thereupon, in <hi>February</hi> following, they dispatch'd a Trumpeter into <hi>England</hi>; by whom they receiv'd that satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Answer to their Letters, from the King of <hi>England,</hi> that soon after the Peace was concluded between His Majesty and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding in <hi>London,</hi> on the behalf of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The News was receiv'd with incredible joy in the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> Sir <hi>Gabriel Sylvius</hi> was sent by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to Complement him upon the Conclusion of the Peace; with whom also the <hi>States</hi> did interchange the Ratification of the Articles.</p>
                     <p>In the interim, His Majesty having caus'd a new sort of Brass Half-pence and Farthings to be made current throughout all <hi>England,</hi> and Coyn'd in the Tower, issued forth a Proclamation, <hi>for the suppression of the particular far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and halfe-pence of private Shopkeepers</hi>; and being inform'd that Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers did notwithstanding continue to utter Halfe-pence and Farthings of their own stamping, he caus'd them to be proceeded against according to Law: which was so effectually done, that many were Convicted and fin'd but upon submission, by the King's mercy Pardon'd.</p>

                        <p>The Dutch secur'd from the English, strive to strengthen themselves by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alliances. And therefore having, by a publick <hi>Placaert,</hi> conferr'd the Commands of Stadtholder, Captain, and Admiral-General of the Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>West-Friezland</hi> to the Prince and his Heir-Males by Lawful Marriage, with all Rights and Priviledges thereto belonging; who thereupon took his Seat in the Assembly of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>West-Friezland</hi> as Primier Noble: The next thing they did, was to conclude such a League as they thought most advantageous; and thereupon a League was entred into, and ratified by them and the Emperour; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> on the one part, and the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> on the other. The Conditions whereof were, <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Lorain <hi>should raise an Army of</hi> 18000 <hi>Horse and Foot by the times in the Treaty limited, to be paid by the Emperour, the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and the States, after the rate of</hi> 9000 <hi>Crowns</hi> per <hi>Moneth; and to act by their orders and directions. The League to last</hi> 10 <hi>years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the other side, the <hi>Swede</hi> joyns himself strictly to the French, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to receive 50000 Crowns a Moneth from the King of <hi>France</hi> for six years, to begin presently after the conclusion of the Peace. Being obliged to declare himself for the French, in case the States, the Emperour, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did not make a League with the French before the fifteenth of <hi>May</hi> next ensuing.</p>
                        <p>But there was no likelyhood of that; for the King of <hi>France</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded satisfaction at the Emperour's Court for the injury done to Count <hi>Furstenburgh</hi> Plenipotentiary for the Bishop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> but obtaining none, the
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:53069:304"/>
Emperour rather seeking to justifie the action, than to punish the actors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his Embassadors from <hi>Cologne,</hi> and brake off the Treaty. Nor would the Interposition of the King of <hi>England</hi> prevail, though he offered his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation to reconcile the differences between the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> also proposed, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should give <hi>Aire,</hi> St. <hi>Omer,</hi> and <hi>Ipres</hi> into the Hands of the French, on Condition that the French should quit all they had got in those parts, and restore <hi>Maestricht</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>: But all in vain, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> affirming, that the French were to restore not only the places they had got in this War, but also all the places they had possessed themselves of since the Treaty with the <hi>Pyreneans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The business of Count <hi>Furstenburgh</hi> was this: He being at <hi>Cologne,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Coach, accompanied only with his Secretary, and two Gentlemen more, attended by three Lacqueys, to visit the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> whose Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary and chief Minister he was, was set upon in the Street by nine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, armed with Sword and Pistol, who being too strong for the Count's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after some kill'd and hurt on both sides, the Count was forc'd out of the City, where stood another strong party to receive him, who carried him to <hi>Bonne,</hi> whence he was sent Prisoner to <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Emperour pretended him a Subject of the Empire, and that he had, contrary to his trust, taken part with his Enemies. Nor were the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as well as the King of <hi>France,</hi> less active in interposing for his Liberty, affirming, that he was the Elector's Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary; that though he had a French Regiment, it was only Nominal, and that he did not receive the profits of it. But the Emperour denied he knew of his being a Plenipotentiary, and that it was not for one of his Subjects to take up Interests contrary to the Interest of his Soveraign; and would not hear of his Release.</p>
                        <p>During these Treaties, the King of <hi>France</hi> had possess'd himself of a great part of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and had put a Garrison into <hi>Germerstein</hi> of 300 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, yet proffered the Elector if he would stand Neuter, to satisfie him for all his Damages, and to withdraw his Souldiers out of <hi>Gemerstein,</hi> and put it into the Hands of any Neutral Prince of the Empire: which he refus'd, upon <hi>Capra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s coming to his Succour.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Switzers,</hi> to hinder the King of <hi>France</hi> from coming into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> offered that <hi>Burgundy</hi> might stand Neutur, proffering themselves security that that Province should punctually observe the Neutrality, and that they would guard the Avenues into it against any Forces of the Empire. And thus stood Affairs at the end of this year.</p>

                        <p>The first thing that presented it self of most Importance beyond Sea this Year, was, that the King of <hi>France</hi> gave order to quit all his Conquests in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> belonging to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> except <hi>Maestricht.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The States also, to be rid of so great a trouble as the Bishop of <hi>Munsteri,</hi> makes Peace with him; the Baron <hi>D' Issola</hi> signing the Articles on the behalf of the Emperor. The chief Articles whereof were, <hi>That the Bishop should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store all places taken during the War: That the Treaty of</hi> Cleves <hi>should be punctually observ'd: And that the King of</hi> Spain <hi>and the</hi> Emperor <hi>should be War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranters for the Observance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now for the better support of the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Dignity, the Dutch <hi>East-India</hi> Company unanimously resolv'd to give Him and his Heirs Male after him, Three in the Hundred of all that their gains, upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision.</p>
                        <p>And then having secur'd themselves from <hi>Munster,</hi> they made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> to keep 14000 Men in the Service of the States, they paying him such a certain Sum.</p>
                        <p>About this time also, the difference between the King of <hi>France</hi> and the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> were wholly Reconcil'd, by the Mediation of the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But on the other side, the King of <hi>France</hi> continues his <hi>German</hi> War; so that <hi>Besancon</hi> the chief City of <hi>Franche Compte</hi> falls into his hands, being rendred upon ordinary Articles, after a short Siege; Nor did the Ciradel hold out much longer.</p>
                        <p>The next Town Besiegd was <hi>Dole,</hi> which not being able to withstand the Fortune of the <hi>French</hi> Arms, yielded it self. After which, <hi>Solines</hi> and <hi>Castle</hi> St. <hi>Anne</hi> being taken, made the Conquest of <hi>Franche Compte</hi> compleat.</p>
                        <p>About the middle of <hi>Iune</hi> was fought the Battle of <hi>Sanzeime,</hi> between the Marshal <hi>Turenne</hi> and the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> wherein the <hi>Imperialists</hi> being far less in Number, had the worst; It was fought from Nine in the Morning till Night, when the <hi>Imperialists</hi> finding themselves over-powr'd, retir'd in very good order, leaving behind about 2000 Men. Nor was the loss of the <hi>French</hi> less considerable: for they lost a great many common Soldiers, but more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</p>
                        <p>A little before this, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had taken the Island of <hi>Normantier</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> where they destroy'd a great deal of Corn; but not long after quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it upon Agreement made with the Inhabitants, and the Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was in great danger, having been long Engag'd with the Enemy. Several Officers of Quality were slain on both sides: among the rest, on the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> part, Sir <hi>Walter Vane</hi> Major-General to the Prince having bravely behav'd himself, was shot in the back and knee, of which he dyed soon after; and of 32 Colonels of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army, 26 were either Kill'd or Wounded, the stress of the Fight lying upon them. Many Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were slain on both sides, though the greatest Number was reported to be lost by the <hi>French,</hi> being said to be above 3000, and many more confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Officers than upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> side.</p>

                        <p>And now the Army of the Confederates, and the <hi>French</hi> under <hi>Turenne,</hi> lying near one another, produc'd some considerable Action, though their wary Commanders would not put all to the push; nor was the Victory fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the grandest of their peformances</p>
                        <p>In the first place, 4000 <hi>French</hi> Horse, most of them the Troops of the King's Houshold, Commanded by Monsieur <hi>Montauban,</hi> fell upon some <hi>Munster</hi> Troops, and a Regiment of Imperial Cuirassiers, who guarded a certain Passage; and with the suddainness of the Attack, put the Imperialists into disorder: but <hi>Caprara</hi>'s Regiment, that of the Prince of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and some others, coming to their Assistance, they gave a stop to the Enemy, till such time as other <hi>Lorain</hi>-Regiments came in: the Fight was sharply maintain'd on both sides, but at last the <hi>French</hi> were forc'd to retire, the slaughter being great on both sides, but greatest on the <hi>French</hi>; and among the rest, <hi>Mountauban</hi> himself was taken Prisoner.</p>
                        <p>The next was an Engagement between the Gross Bodies of both Armies: for <hi>Turenne</hi> Advancing toward <hi>Colmar,</hi> found the Confederates drawn up in Battalia, readily attending his coming. The Fight was bloody and tedious, and many of the <hi>French</hi> Commanders were slain, but more common Souldiers of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> side; but Night coming on, all Action ceased: However, the <hi>French</hi> continued in Arms all Night, expecting to have renew'd the Fight next Morning; but when the <hi>Imperialists</hi> perceiv'd that, they retreated in great Disorder to <hi>Schlestadt,</hi> and repassed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Strasburgh.

The same Fate befel <hi>South-Holland</hi>; and it is said, that had the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation continu'd 24 hours longer, the whole Country would have run a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being lost.</p>
                        <q>And thus you have an account in brief of all the most memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Transactions since the greatest act of Providence that has been observed for many Ages, The happy Restauration of his Majesty. And we may aver, that here is nothing but Truth, if all the publick Intelligence of so many years have not fail'd. This is then a Story in dead Colours; it behoves them that will lay it in the lively Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to take more pains than may be thought has here been taken, and have greater helps than it was possible for us to have to make use of. And therefore if there be any that with the Knowledge of a Privy-Councellor, and the Eloquence of a <hi>Salust,</hi> will undertake to cull out the most important Actions which are here reduc'd into order ready to his hand (for some of these he must take, or be silent) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile them into a judicious History, we are ready to vail Bonnet: in the mean time, these few Sheets may pass for Common Satisfaction.</q>
