            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This being, Sir, my Judgment upon the whole Letter, You may well expect that I should make it good, by an Induction from particular Instances; but before I do this, I must deal impartially, and assure you, that as to the main Controversie, I think the Bishop hath much the better of Mr.</hi> Baxter: <hi>For, if the Question between them, was as Dr.</hi> Gunning <hi>and Dr.</hi> Pearson <hi>do attest, such a command is so evidently lawful, that I shall much wonder if Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>did ever dispute it; and</hi> till he doth clearly disprove that that <note place="margin">An Elegance.</note> was not the thing in Question, <hi>I must needs think that he hath much forgot himself in making an imperfect and parlial Relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Setting aside therefore the business of that particular Contest (wherein you see how much I am inclined to Favour the Bishop) there are other things in his Letter, of general concernment, which I think liable to just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; As,]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Am more puzzled what to <hi>Call</hi> This whiffling <hi>Incognito</hi> that Libels the Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> then to <hi>prove</hi> him any thing almost but what he should be.</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95548:4"/>
By his <hi>Severity</hi> upon the Bishops <hi>Passion,</hi> I should take him for a <hi>Stoique:</hi> by That upon his <hi>Style;</hi> for a <hi>Critique:</hi> by the <hi>Divertisement</hi> (he says) <hi>the Bishops Letter gave him,</hi> for a <hi>Phanatique;</hi> and by his <hi>Dog-Periphrasis</hi> of <hi>Madness,</hi> I find, the man would gladly be suspected of some Skill in <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Bishop thinks himself ill us'd by Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>and the</hi> Animadverter <hi>steps between (at the request we must Imagine of</hi> the Honourable) <hi>He undertakes to say what he dislikes in the</hi> One, <hi>what in the</hi> Other: <hi>and in fine, Many a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel he picks with the</hi> Bishop, <hi>dividing only in</hi> One <hi>Point from the</hi> Presbyterian. <hi>That is (in his own Terms)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the main Controversie, I think the Bishop hath much the better of Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> For if the Question between them, was as Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi>

                  <hi>To passe over the</hi> Libellers <hi>Scandalous, and Barefac'd</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures; <hi>His Rude and Impetuous</hi> Violences, <hi>wee'l only ask;</hi> Why <hi>all</hi> this Fury, and Contrivement against the Bishop? <hi>Is't as a</hi> Friend <hi>to a</hi> silenc'd Brother; <hi>And the</hi> main cause? <hi>Tho' by the Spite I should suspect a</hi> Personal Pique: <hi>But there may be something else in't too; and if</hi> the man comes off at last, say I'm a Wizard. <hi>No matter what it is; Hee's very much</hi> Offended: <hi>And no matter for that neither.</hi> Offended <hi>he is at the</hi> Stile, <hi>I would he had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reld it in a</hi> Better; <hi>but at the Bishops</hi> Passion <hi>beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Truly, upon Perusal of it more then Once, and weighing it Word by Word, I can find nothing in the</hi> Language, <hi>that does not very well beseeme the</hi> Pen, <hi>and</hi> Dignity <hi>of a</hi> Prelate. <hi>Yet there was Cause enough for a little</hi> Sharpnesse: <hi>and here's the Case in short.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Worcester <hi>finding the Parish of</hi> Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster <hi>infected with Mr.</hi> Baxters Doctrine <hi>(who Preach'd there without either</hi> Cure, <hi>or</hi> License) <hi>forbids him to Preach there any more, and Preaches there himself, to Disabuse them: hinting the unfaithful dealing they had receiv'd, from One in great Authority among them, concerning the</hi> Kings Cause; <hi>The</hi> Rites <hi>of the Church, and</hi> the sinfulnesse of a Lawful Command, because by <hi>Accident it</hi> might be the occasion of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereupon, Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>addresses to the Inhabitants of</hi> Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminster, <hi>pretends that he was silenc'd for denying such a Position; (Which was not so, but for Preaching without a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense) and charges the Bishop to have delivered in the Pulpit words tending to his</hi> Defamation, <hi>and neither of</hi> Charity, Truth, <hi>nor</hi> Sobernesse. <hi>This</hi> Scandal <hi>and some other</hi> Partial Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, short of, <hi>and</hi> beyond <hi>the true State of the Matter, were the occasion of the Bishops Letter, where I must confesse the Bishop of</hi> Worcester <hi>may be thought thus far</hi> Severe <hi>to Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>in that he hath foyld him by</hi> Proofs <hi>not to be</hi> denyed, <hi>and by</hi> Reasons <hi>not to be</hi> answered.</p>
