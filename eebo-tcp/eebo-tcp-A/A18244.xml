         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>Cato</hi> into English, some twelve
years since: whose labour, I cannot blame:
but tying himselfe, strictly to the words; he
could not alwaies, either so fully, or so gracefully, expresse
the mening: for indeed, the words of one language, cannot
alwaies be reached, by the very same words of another:
which made an Able man, in this cause to say: <hi>Nec
verbum verbo curabis reddere.</hi> And therefore seeing
the sence especially in precepts, is principally to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
there is iustly a liberty given, in this kinde, not
onely to use Periphrases, but Paraphrases also, as the
cause may require, which liberty if I be censured by any
to have used too liberally: Yet so long as <hi>Sensus est
in tuto,</hi> and nothing is said, but what is drawn, <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia
verborum:</hi> I expect to be excused at least, if not
commended: And if many of these, seeme rather Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrases,
or rather Collateral Conceits then translations:
yet seeing they tend all to the same sence: and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
translations are sent before, as set alwayes next the
latine: they are but after the fashion of young men; who
weare thin cloaths, in cold winter, but haue good warm
wast-cotes vnder them, and some men, may bee of that
<pb facs="tcp:8357:3"/>
disposition, to take as much delight, in the conceit of the
Expressing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> as in the expressing of the conceit-And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
this kinde of writing, seemes not onely away of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
but a Fruit: Not only an Exercise, but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of Invention; and if there were nothing else, but
the Variety; we see, how much the Eye, is delighted with
varietie of colours, in the same obiect; the Eare, with
variety of Descant upon the same Plaine song; &amp; euen
Nature herselfe, seemes delighted with it: For, who
doubts, but into one forme of a Flower, she could have
infused all kinde ofsents; and all, of sappes, but that shee
takes a pleasure, in the variety of Formes. Some man will
perhaps say; Here is variety indeed; but one well done
were better then all: what good doth choice, where All is
Refuse stuffe? It is true: but let this man bring better
stuffes out of his warehouse; &amp; then, let these be thrown
away: till then, he may content himselfe with these; They
may keepe him warme, though not make him fine. And
seeing there is variety of Iudgements; it is not unfit, to
tender them, variety of Expressings: some may take
better with one Iudgement: some, with another:
and oftentimes, one Expressing, gives lustre to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and makes the reason, which lay hid before
to looke abroad: which is not yet, another thing; but
the same thing, in another light: and lastly, being Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Morality; they cannot haue too many allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb facs="tcp:8357:3"/>
How soever it be; the worke I am sure, is such, as
need not repent me, of one moneth spent in writing it:
Nor thee, whosoever thou art of one houre spent in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it. I have quoted in the margent such places in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
writings, as are consonant &amp; agreeing with these
Precepts of <hi>Cato;</hi> that we may see, how farre it hath
pleased God, to illuminate even Heathen men, in matters
of Morality. And I intended, to have set at the end, a
Patterne of the like variety in Latin; done eyther by
<hi>Virgil,</hi> or by <hi>Ausonius:</hi> and translated in a greater
variety into English: but considering, this present work
is it selfe, nothing else, but variations: I have chosen
rather to omit it, least it might be thought, a supernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie
idlenesse: yet thus much, we may gather by it; that
even the Ancients scorned not, this variety of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
either as an exercise to the Writer, or a delight
to the Reader; and seeing it hath beene now so long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne;
it may come in also, as a novelty: and so I may
suppose my selfe to haue two good supporters, (varietie
&amp; noueltie) to helpe to beare out my own imperfections.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Cato,</hi> that was the Author of these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
whether it were a Person, or but a Name onely, (as
<hi>Cicero</hi> called his booke <hi>De senectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Cato Major,</hi> to
giue it the more lustre of grauitie) it is uncertaine, but
certaine it is, what <hi>Cato</hi> it was, is nothing certaine: and
not much more certain, what time he liued; only <hi>Io. Scal.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8357:4"/>
by some probable coniecture gathereth: that he lived, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the times of the Emperours <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus:</hi>
which might well bee: seeing the <hi>saeculum</hi> of
yeeres,<note place="margin">about an. Dom. 170.</note> next proceeding; was in sobriety of manners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Romans, of all other, the most flourishing.
And though the Emperours themselves were not yet
Christians; yet they made approches toward it, in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Doctrine, as neere, as could be: as, well testifies that
excellent Booke of Morality: written by the learned
Emperour, <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antonius;</hi> father vnto
<hi>Commodus:</hi> which, to the great commendation of the
Translatour, is lately published amongst us: out of which
perhaps this <hi>Cato,</hi> whosoever hee was, might make
choice of some speciall Precepts: and put them, into short
Disticks; for the better reteining them in memory. And
for my selfe; if any man thinke me Repuerascere; and
to enter upon a worke, that were fitter for a schoole boy:
let him know, that one Planudes, long since, and of late,
<hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> two excellent men, &amp; of singular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
haue Both of them, thought it no disparagement
to their grauitie, to translate them into <hi>Greeke;</hi> as, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned men haue likewise done into other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
whose Examples, I dare boldly oppose to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of any, or all Inferiour Iudgements.</p>
