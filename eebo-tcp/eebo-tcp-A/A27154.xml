            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our induſtrious endeavours for the benefit of all men, and particularly for the good of this Nation, hath well deſerved the gratefull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of all good men, and of my ſelf in ſpeciall: for that in my ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall retirement I have received ſome profit, and very much innocent and refreſhing delights in the peruſall of thoſe treatiſes, which are by your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hand communicated to the publick.</p>
            <p>My education was amongſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in Academyes, where I ſpent many yeares in converſing with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of books only. A little before our wars began, I ſpent two ſummers in travelling towards the South, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52612:3"/>
purpoſe to learn to know men and forreign manners. Since my return, I have been conſtantly imployed in a weighty office, by which I am not diſengaged from the care of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick welfare in the peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of this Nation; but obliged to be the more ſollicitous and tender in preſerving it, and promoting it. Wherefore, taking notice that this County is reputed the <hi>Orchard</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and (in the generality of good husbandry) excelleth many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; I offer it (as my duty) to give you ſome plain and unpoliſhed account of our <hi>Agriculture</hi> in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordſhire</hi>: which I do the more willingly undertake, for that I do not yet know of any other addreſſe is made unto you from this County. Here I obſerve the wiſeſt and beſt of our Gentry to be very carefull in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward ſuch kind of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, as beſt agrees with the nature of the ſoyl where he inhabiteth. From
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52612:3"/>
the greateſt perſons to the pooreſt cottager, all habitations are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Orchards and Gardens; and in moſt places our hedges are inriched with rowes of fruit-trees, pears, or apples, Gennet-moyles, or crab trees. Of theſe, the Pears make a weak drink fit for our <hi>hindes,</hi> and is generally refuſed by our Gentry, as breeding wind in the ſtomack; yet this drink (till the heat of Summer hath caught it,) is moſt pleaſing to the female palat, having a reliſh of weak wine mixed with ſugar. If mingled with ſome harſh kind of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, it makes a happy mixture; and our obſervant houſe-keepers know how to mix them to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Some peares are apt to incline 2the drink to be roapy, and they are known by giving a wheyiſh colour to the liquor. I know a good husband that cuts down and deſtroyes ſuch peare-trees from off his ground, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them the worſt kind of weeds.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52612:4"/>
For others are ſo nice as to refuſe the drink, and women love it beſt, as ſweeteſt, till it be roapy. Moſt other kinds of perry are of a more water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, then apple-cider, and more luſhious. The white-horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare yields a juyce ſomewhat neer to the quality of cider; and the neighbourhood of <hi>Bosbury</hi> is famous for a peculiar perry, which hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the maſculine qualities of cider. It is as quick, ſtrong, and heady, high-coloured; and retaineth a good vigour two or three Summers, yea in great veſſells and good cellars ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, before it declineth. The fruit is ſo hard and courſe, that a man cannot endure to bite a morſell of it, and a pig will refrain it. This <hi>Bosbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> peare is there called the <hi>Bareland</hi> peare: and as the liquor approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to apple-cider in colour, ſtrength, and excelleth in durance; ſo the bloom cometh forth of a damask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe colour, like apples, not like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52612:4"/>
peares. Our Gennet moyles are commonly found in hedges, or in our worſt ſoyle, moſt commonly in <hi>Irchinfield,</hi> or towards <hi>Wales,</hi> where the land is ſomewhat dry and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. This fruit is nice, and apt to be diſcouraged by blaſts, and we do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily expect a failing of them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other year, eſpecially in dry ſoil; and the reaſon is apparent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. But this fruit makes the beſt cider in my judgement, &amp; ſuch as I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer before the much-commended red-ſtrak't muſt. For this Gennet moyle, if it be ſuffered to ripen upon the tree, not to be mellow but to be yellowiſh and fragrant, and then to be hoorded in heapes under the trees, a fortnight or three weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you grind them; it is (at diſtance) the moſt fragrant of all cider-fruit, &amp; gives the liquor a moſt delicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume. So, for tarts and pyes, it is much commended. The Crab is commonly ground for Verjuice,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52612:5"/>
and ſometimes hoorded till neer <hi>December,</hi> and then mingled with cider, or waſhings of cider, to make a mordicant cider, which doth well pleaſe our day-labourers; and would ſurely well agree with a <hi>French</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants palat. And, for a freſh wonder, I aſſure you, that we have lately found out, that one of our moſt delicate kinds of Cider is made of a kind of Crab, called a <hi>Bromsbery</hi> Crab, thus hoorded: it being much like a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack wine, of a very pleaſing ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This experiment is not yet known to many of our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it being reſerved to few as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell myſtery. I have ſometimes tryed the Cider of Pippins only, well ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not green windfalls, nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripened, and ſomewhat hoorded: and I find it to be a very pleaſant drink, and do conceive it to be the moſt wholeſome, and moſt reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all ſorts of Cider.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you how all our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52612:5"/>
villages, and generally all our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes (all our vales being thick ſet with rowes of villages) are in the ſpring-time ſweetned, and beautyfied with the bloomed trees, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their changeable varietyes of Ornament, till (in the end of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn) they fill our Garners with pleaſant fruit, and our cellars with rich and winey liquors. Few cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, yea very few of our wealthieſt yeomen do taſt any other drink in the family, except at ſome ſpeciall feſtivalls, twice or thrice in the year, and that for variety, rather than with choice.</p>
            <p>Orchards being the Pride of our Countrey, and the Scene of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe, I will offer unto you two Obſervations upon that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as properly directive to them that can affect the pleaſure or profit, which muſt needs be, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, very much: As, for that they do not only ſweeten, but alſo purifie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52612:6"/>
the ambient aire, (which I conceive to conduce very much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant health and long lives, for which our County hath been alwayes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;) and for that they fence our habitations and walks from the ſtroke of winds and ſtorms in the Winter, and afford us ſhelter &amp; ſhade in the heat of Summer; and (if I may acknowledge gratefull trifles) for that they harbour a conſtant aviary of ſweet ſingers, which are here retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without the charge or violence of the <hi>Italian</hi> Wiers.</p>
            <p>My firſt Obſervation is this; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that, if other Countreys would ſubmit to the ſame patience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as is uſuall amongſt us, they might partake of a great meaſure (at leaſt) of the ſame bleſſings. As we ſee in our borderers of <hi>Shropſhire, Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi>; and much more in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> &amp;c. My reaſon I take from the wonderfull difference
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52612:6"/>
of ſoyles where we abound with rich Orchards. About <hi>Bromyard,</hi> a cold air, and a ſhallow barren ſoyl, yet ſtore of Orchards of divers kinds of ſpicey and ſavoury apples. About <hi>Roſſe</hi> and <hi>Webley,</hi> and towards the <hi>Hay,</hi> a ſhallow, hot, ſandy or ſtony rye-land, &amp; expos'd to a changeable air from the diſguſts of the black mountain; yet here, and all over <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinfield,</hi> and alſo about <hi>Lemſter,</hi> both towards <hi>Keinton,</hi> and towards <hi>Fayremile</hi> (which makes a third dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of ſhallow and ſtarvy land,) in all theſe barren provinces, as good ſtore of undeceiving Orchards, as in the richeſt vale of the County, even by <hi>Frome</hi> banks. Only, as I fore-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where the dryeſt fruit-trees are planted in a very hot, ſhallow, and dry ſoyle, there we muſt be content with a full and certain bleſſing every ſecond year. This being alſo allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſome ſoyle and ſome air is more agreeable for ſome kinde of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52612:7"/>
fruit, than for other: as for example, <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> is more proper for peares and cherryes, than <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> more proper for Apples. The reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may in part appear by this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing illuſtration. Where the turf is very ſhallow, the rough ſtarvy ground (which in this countrey we wrongfully call <hi>Marle</hi>) hinders the tender root of the apple-tree from deſcending deep enough for due nouriſhment, and fit ſhelter. There (as in the ground which we eſteem the moſt barren) the root of the pear-tree, having a more piercing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, breaks his way through this courſe Marle, as it will alſo cleave through ſome veins of rocks and ſtones; and, under this ſtarvy ground, it finds a more congeniall and richer nouriſhment; as appears by the ſtore of fruit, fair and juicy, and alſo by the rinde of the tree, ſmooth, bright-coloured, and free
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52612:7"/>
from moſs. This we alſo note, that in a deep ſoyl, that is moſt kind for apples, if the root of a pear-tree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends deep into a ſoft clay ground, the tree ſpends all his ſtrength in growing downwards, and becomes leſſe ſpacious, leſſe beautifull in the head, and leſſe fruitfull. And where ſome peares find great difference of ſoyle, whether grafted or planted by the ſtock, there it differeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in bulk, and oft times in other qualities very much. Which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me to explain, why there is ſuch different kinds of pears in every Countrey: their ſhape and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore alſo their names, being changed ſo often, and ſo eaſily.</p>
            <p>Alſo I have frequently noted, that the richeſt Cider, and the beſt-taſted apples for the table, do grow in the ſoyle that is leſſe deep and leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for other uſes, as in a high ground, or dry land. And you ſhall find the better-taſted fruit to be more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52612:8"/>
wrethed or wrinckled, or ſpotted with warts, moles, or freckles, or of a more ruſſet, or yellow colour. The other apple, that comes from the richer and lower ground, is more pallid, more plump, but more wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and inſipid. I conclude this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation with this direction, That ſince no kind of ſoyle ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourage us, and yet much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard muſt be had of fitting the fruit to the ſoyle, therefore we muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our firſt care in the plantation of a nurſery, where our experiences may daily increaſe, and the plants alſo be educated, prepared and fitted for the neighbouring ſoyle. For what <hi>Columella</hi> ſaith of Vines, I may as truely ſay of Fruit-trees; <hi>Quod ex lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginquo petitur, parum familiariter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro ſolo venit, propter quod difficilius convaleſcit alienum exterae regionis. Optimum eſt ergo eodem agro quo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem diſpoſiturus es, vel certe vicino, facere ſeminarium: idque multum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52612:8"/>

            <p>My ſecond obſervation is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to encourage the plantation of a Nurſery, by directing the ſure way how to fit the ſoyl with the greateſt variety of fruits, and alſo to obtain the ſpeedieſt reward together with a yearly delight in novelties, &amp; a like growth in experiences.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I muſt now imbark ninto ſome paradoxes, which will not eaſily obtain belief, &amp; leaſt of all amongſt our own Countreymen here in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordſhire,</hi> for ſome reaſons which hereafter will occurr, I will make my entrance with a plain and true ſtory.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The ſecond was contradicted by daily experience, which vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that many apple-kernels will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate to crabs, at leaſt if taken from apples planted on a crab-ſtock: and that crab-kernels are better for a plantation, than any apple-kernels.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52612:10"/>5. The fifth, as refuted in all our Orchards every where.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſtill retained my good opinion of the mans honeſty and experience. Therefore I reſolved to make exact triall with patience. I dig'd holes of three foot breadth in a parcell of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary clay-ground. [Note that the whole piece of clay-ground was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſomewhat deep with the ſpade before, that the ſetlings might gather root as well in that vulgar ground, as alſo in the finer mold.] I enquired ſlips of ſeverall trees that grew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out graffing, and bore ſeverall fruits of their naturall kind: theſe I placed each kind round about the verges of the ſeverall holes. By diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry the firſt Spring I found four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſeverall ſorts of theſe naturall apples, the fruit much differing in taſt, ſhape and colour; ſome only green and ſowriſh, ſome red-ſtraked, ſome party-coloured, and very pleaſant,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52612:10"/>
ſome table-fruit in Summer, ſome Winter fruit, ſome cider fruit. Of all theſe the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> codling was by odds the worſt: not many better then the <hi>French</hi> Cornell. Having placed theſe ſlips in the border of the hole at a foot diſtance, I filled up the hole with a fine kind of garden-mould, carryed thither in barrows. This I raiſed not in Tumps, for I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the inconvenience, that it would be a harbour for ants or piſmires. I kept it alſo at an equall levell, that the rain might not lodge there, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the young roots. In the midſt of this fine mold, in the moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate weather, I did monethly, from Autumn to the next Spring, ſet ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the fineſt ſort of apples, with delineating in a ſciograph the ſeveral kinds in ſeverall places. I now find that the kernells of apples grafted on crab-ſtocks prove not all crabs, nor (as I gueſſe) altogether of the kind of that apple, whence the kernell was taken.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52612:11"/>2<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> That, as the mold is <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ner where they firſt grow, ſo the fruit ſeemeth more civil, and in courſe ground they degenerate towards the crab. Our neighbours, for a nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſow the droſſe or muſt (as we call it) of apples ground in a cider-mill. But I have noted the faireſt kernells to be bruiſed in the mill, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being ſmall, and ſown in courſe land, become a kind of crabs.</p>
            <p>And that the kernells of naturall apples do very much propend to the kind of which they are deſcended. This was neglected, and therefore unknown to our neighbours, who had no need of this curioſity, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo addicted to graffing, that they take not notice of any naturall apple, except the Gennet moyle, the Ky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doddin, the Sweeting, and the <hi>French</hi> Cornell; which are found in all places. Tis ſure that kernells of the ſame apples, in a far differing ſoyl, do produce a different apple;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52612:11"/>
but (as I ſaid) ſtill with ſome inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the originall, if it be the kernell of an ungrafted apple. And this may advertiſe the beſt ſeaſon of deſigning variety; namely, in applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of choice compoſt to the very kernel, as <hi>Gab. Plat</hi> preſcribeth <hi>Exp.</hi> 14. <hi>pag.</hi> 210. of the Additions to the excellent Legacy. All other ſtories, of powring liquors into the bark, or bulk of the tree, are effete and idle phanſies, for nine dayes wonder.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, I find the truth, &amp; that much more might be added to <hi>Lawſons</hi> rules, of diſtinguiſhing the hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fruit by the firſt leaves of the yearling plant. For a ſhort and dark-green leaf prognoſticateth a crabbed fruit. With a larger leaf and thick, but alſo dark-green, I have found a good Winter-apple, but the ſtock hardy to endure a ſtiffe clay-ground. A fady willowiſh broad leaf noteth a flat, inſipid apple, as the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Codling, which holds out
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52612:12"/>
well againſt blaſts. A paler green, as the Poppinjay, or barbery leaf, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the leaf be limber alſo, noteth a delicate fruit: and the broader the leaf, the fairer that fruit. A wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led leaf, neither very dark, nor very light, proves red-ſtrak't crab-ſtocks have reddiſh tops. More particulars will occurr by ordinary obſervation.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, For the incredible durance of apple-trees to a thouſand years, I have upon much experience &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons much abated the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of my cenſure. 'Tis certainly true (as <hi>Gabriel Plat</hi> in the foreſaid place noteth,) that if a man aime at his preſent profit, then graffing is his way: but if he aime at the profit of his poſterity, then it is beſt not to graft at all. This I add, that moſt ungraffed apples are apt by the overweight of their fruit to leane towards the ground: and I have ſeen many of them quell'd quite to the ground; where they do renew their ſtrength,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52612:12"/>
and get up again into many Trunks, in a continued order, anſwerable to the old fable of the Giant <hi>Antaeus.</hi> Every aſpiring Trunk of ſome of theſe naturall apples, is much more laſting than any grafted fruit-tree: and many very aged people have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, that they have diſcerned no difference either of their growth or decay, in their whole age from their childhood. I will tell you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my credit the wonders of one tree of this kind, now growing in <hi>Ocle Pitchard:</hi> the fruit is not very ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, nor pleaſant; the leaf dark-green, and ſtiff. My known friend (for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) made of that tree five of our large hogſheads, conſiſting of ſixty four Statute gallons of cider, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of any water. It or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily yieldeth four hogſheads, and ſeldome or (as they aſſure me that dwell there) never faileth of three. Yet few of our Countreymen have heard of it, or take notice of it. This
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52612:13"/>
tree hath had very many upriſings, ſo that I conceive it hath been many hundreds of years making this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe. My dear alliance, Mr. <hi>Thomas Taylor,</hi> was owner of it many yeares, and dwelt alwayes in that pariſh. He is now paſt eighty yeares old, of firm ſtrength and freſh memory: yet he affirmeth, that he never could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any change in the tree. And his wife for many years tried to plant the branches, but was utterly diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their ſlow motion. I have for three yeares tried ſome branches, which ſeem only to keep a faint life, with very little progreſſe. The ground on which this great tree growes, is paſture, and ſeems not in the age of man to have been broken up, or relieved with compoſt, or freſh mold; which may ſhew, that it is a very hardy plant. So much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the adventure of mine own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, which may be examined by a thouſand witneſſes, to confirm the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52612:13"/>
credit, or rather gueſſe and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, of Mr. <hi>Lawſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5ly. For duration of the fruit-tree, much care muſt be had in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, which ſhould be ſoon after the leaf is faln, when the Autumnall rains have ſoftned the earth at the roots, that the roots be not bruiſed or wounded in the removall: and then the tree ſhould keep the ſame poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the heavens; the roots layd alſo in the ſame poſture, the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler fibers or bearded roots rather cut at the ends, then crumpled up: and the earth in which the ſtock is laid, ſomewhat of the ſame kind, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and mellowed, not with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted muck, but with fine mold, and ſhovellings of the fold. If the roots are cut or bruiſed, to the ſame proportion the branches muſt be lopped. In a grafted plant every bow ſhould be lopped, at the very tops, in apples and peares; not in cherries and plums. In a naturall plant, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52612:14"/>
bowes ſhould not at all be lopped, but ſome taken off cloſe to the trunk; that the root at firſt replantation be not engaged to maintain too many ſuckers. And this muſt be done with ſuch diſcretion, that the top-branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es be not too cloſe together; for the naturall plant is apt to grow ſpiry, &amp; thereby failes of fruitfulneſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the reſerved branches be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided at a convenient roundneſſe. The branches that are cut off, may be ſet, and will grow, but ſlowly. If the top prove ſpiry or the fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, then the due remedy muſt be in graffing.</p>
            <p>Neither is graffing to be uſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a remedy. For it doth moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly improve the kind of the fruit: inſomuch that a graft of the ſame fruit doth meliorate the fruit, as is lately much obſerved by our <hi>Welſh</hi> neighbours, who do graffe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net-moyle upon the ſame ſtock, and thereby obtain a larger apple, more
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52612:14"/>
juicy, and better for all uſes: and ſome triplicate their graffings (for a curioſity) upon the ſame account.</p>
            <p>And it is noted amongſt us, that a pearmain or any other pleaſant fruit either for cider, or the table, is much ſweeter, if grafted upon the ſtock of a Gennet-moyle, or Kydoddin, than if grafted on a crab-ſtock; though much leſſe laſting upon the ſtock of the Gennet-moyle: the Gennet-moyl being alſo leſſe laſting, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, where they are generally planted of large ſetlings, which muſt needs wound them in their very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and therefore hinder their duration.</p>
            <p>Alſo graffing doth much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or at leaſt expedite the reward, eſpecially if the graffe be taken from a branch that hath ſome yeares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly born ſound fruit plentifully. Truſt not to one yeares triall. <hi>Poteſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim vel anni proventu, vel aliis de cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naturaliter infoecunda ſemel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberare:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52612:15"/>
ſed ubi plurimis velut eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis annorum ſtipendiis fides ſurculo conſtitit, nihil dubitandum eſt de foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunditate: nec tamen ultra quadrien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium talis extenditur inquiſitio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Columella</hi> in a like caſe; <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus we ſee how to haſten the reward both by graffing, and in the choice of the graffe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And how to ſweeten the fruit and better it, both by the choice of a pleaſing ſtock and alſo of a kind graffe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And how to multiply variety in the diverſity of compoſt, eſpecially at the firſt plantation of the kernell; and I add, with frequent application of pleaſant infuſions, and liquids, as in which anniſe ſeeds, fennel, roſemary, or other agreeable aromaticks have been ſteeped: yet beware of giving too much juice to a young plant; for that may drown it, or make it leſſe guſtfull: And I never ſaw an Orchard prove, where the ground was wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52612:15"/>
with a water-gall, or where the moiſture did for ſome time lye there, and could not be drained away. Yet near a running ſink of ſoyled water, I have ſeen the approaching trees ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of their fruit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And hence we ſee how to plant an Orchard that may probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the worlds end. And in this point I have inſinuated ſome part of my paradoxes, by the way of a ſtory, and in pretence of defending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the opinion &amp; common practiſe of mine own Countrey-men. Mr. <hi>Lawſons</hi> book I have not now at hand, neither can I record his judgement verbally, but I think I have ſtuck cloſe to his ſenſe.</p>
            <p>He addeth, that the fruit of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall plant doth grow better and pleaſanter by time, as better at thirty yeares growth than at twenty yeares growth. This I know not. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Alſo he requireth much more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52612:16"/>
diſtance of the trees than we obſerve as ſixty foot at leaſt. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Orchards are at twenty foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; our beſt Orchards at thirty at leaſt, by alternative rowes <hi>per quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuncem.</hi> In large crofts of arable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for conſtant tillage, which is a neceſſary help to fruit-trees, our beſt husbands graft high, and preferre <hi>Lawſons</hi> utmoſt diſtance, even ſixty yards, that the teames may not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the trees; and then the trees bear a full load of fruit, and ſpread to the naturall perfection. This I adde, that if you would have the trees grow tall, and ſhadow more in Summer, and keep off winds better in Winter, and the fruit the ſweeter, then you ſhould plant the cloſer together, yet never nearer then twenty foot.</p>
            <p>To conclude my paradoxes; He that is provided of a nurſery, need not be very nicely provident for the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity of his trees. A ſmall parcell of ground will furniſh ſtore for all his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52612:16"/>
grounds, and for all his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to play away upon graffings and novell experiments. And to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage this nurſery, I now ſumm up all with my laſt paradox, That for theſe four laſt yeares, whereof two were very dry Summers, I laid the fruitfull ſprayes of naturall apple-plants in the ground, ſome very ſmall, not two foot above ground, all thereabout; and from the firſt Summer to this preſent Spring, they never failed to bear as thick as traces of onyons. But it is better for the plant, if you pull off the young apples ſoon after they be knitted, the firſt year at leaſt. Some I laid alſo of four yards length under ground, the ſprayes lying ſlope above ground: theſe grow and bear incredibly. Others I ſlope, and pare away the bordering turfe, that the reflected Sun may give me the early benefit of a dwarf Orchard; and theſe againſt Midſummer, are as big as a Ladies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52612:17"/>
fiſt. I preſent them to ſtore of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. If I dwelt neer <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> I ſhould make my new-planted Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery as rich as an Orchard. All natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall apples are not of this precocity: the more durable (as I ſaid before) are much more ſullen. Some require a knot for the root, others not: all three the better for it. To ſome a ſmall ſlice from the bark is as good. Before <hi>December,</hi> whilſt the ſpray growes on the tree, by the bluntneſs of the bud you may diſcover what branch will bear fruit the next Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer immediately following, if you cut off the branch, and ſet it before the buds be ſprouted too far forward, (as you may in <hi>February,</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>March.</hi>) This (with ſome) will paſſe as a propheſy. A ſore blaſt or <hi>May</hi>-Froſts may deceive you. Of theſe naturall apples there are not paſt ſix or ſeven kinds diſtinguiſhed by proper names amongſt us. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they can never be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52612:17"/>
for that every individuall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes aſſumes a peculiar nature from the infinite variety of compoſt. In this nurſery, 'tis the ſame pains, and no charge, to try the ſeeds of firres, pines, cypres, pitch, &amp;c. which prove better for replantation than in hote beds.</p>
            <p>Of the Art of graffing either with the ciens, bud or leaf, I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe every village amongſt us yieldeth ſtore of Artiſts: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny books ſhew the rules; but in theſe things an Artiſt can teach more in a day, than a book in a moneth.</p>
            <p>One reaſon why fruit do ſo abound in this County, is, for that no man hath of late years built him a houſe, but with ſpeciall regard to the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſome ground fit for an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, which ſhould be of ſome depth, as is commonly towards the foot of a deſcending ground, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with a proclivity towards the South; and the land not too fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52612:18"/>
or hollow, but ſomewhat tough, binding and tenacious, leaſt the winds root up the ſtocks. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſervants when they betake to marriage, ſeek out an acre or two of ground, which they find fit for Orchard: for this they give a fine, or double value for years or lives; and thereon they build a Cottage, &amp; plant an Orchard, which is all the wealth they have for themſelves, and their poſterity.</p>
            <p>For Gardens, we have little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to deſigne more than is for the neceſſary uſe of our own families, except our River <hi>Wye</hi> may be made navigable for tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And by defect of tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our ſtore of cider is become a ſnare to many, who turne Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings into wantonneſſe &amp; drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The credit of Cider being of few late years much advanced in the eſtimation of our beſt Gentry, who have ſought out the right method of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52612:18"/>
ripening and hoording the choiceſt fruits, and of finding the right ſeaſon of drawing it, and ſome alſo of bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling it. But I am confident that much more may be added to the perfection of it, when they ſhall alſo apply to it the due ſubtleties of the myſterious art of fermentation.</p>
            <p>I found it much amended, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pure cider upon the freſh lees of a butt of ſack, newly drawn.</p>
            <p>In Vines our Gentry have lately contended in a profitable ambition to excell each other: ſo that the white muſcadell is vulgar, the purple and black grape frequent, the parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-grape and Frontiniack in many hands.</p>
            <p>Wall-nuts belong to our high-way ſides, and are fitteſt for dry and ſtony grounds. I find them for the dryeſt ground of the Nurſery a never-fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing companion. In <hi>Columella</hi> we may find many excellent rules how to aſcertain and haſten their

growth, and to mend their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>The large Cheſtnut being ſuch a maſculine food for luſtie ruſticks, and ſo much uſed at the beſt tables in <hi>France,</hi> and ſo ſavoury in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſtrongeſt cider with ſalt, I much blame our Countreymen, that we have no more uſe of a food that would ſoon become cheap, common, and laſting.</p>
            <p>All theſe nuts and filberts do acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate growth, (as I have proved,) by the rules of <hi>Columella: In aqua mulſa, nec ninius dulci macerato, it a jucundio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſaporis fructum, cum adoleverit, praebebit, &amp; interim melius &amp; celerius frondebit, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and again, <hi>de arb.</hi> 22.

            <p>I do much wonder that ſuch a ſingular honeſt man as <hi>Gabriel Plat</hi> ſhould write, that it is found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that a cheſnut in ten or twelve yeares will grow into a fair tree, able to be the maſter-poſt of a fair build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

            <p>For paſtures we add improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments daily, and as a ſtranger paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by our habitations, by our fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Orchards, paſtures, arable, he may diſtinguiſh a well-ordered houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper and a freeholder, from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-wracked Tenant, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift.</p>

            <p>With one ſad note I muſt now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this diſcourſe. I wiſh this ſore proverb, <hi>Bona terra, mala gens,</hi> may not belong to us. The moſt High hath filled us with his bleſſings, but we fail ſo much in returning due thanks, that we many times turn his bleſſings into heavy curſes, and make his liberall gifts the prevailing cauſe of our haſty ruine. And whereas the rurall life ſhould in all reaſon be the moſt humble, tame, and innocent: yet daily experience ſheweth, that where any Trade of Manufacture is driven on, there the word of God beares a price: Where Trade thrives not, there the word of God is at the beſt but as a pleaſant ſong: if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they hear it, yet ſeldome they obey it. And all doors and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes are oppreſſed with idle and ſturdy vagabonds: and it is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52612:22"/>
for an honeſt Iuſticiary to do the work of <hi>Hercules</hi> in cleanſing the <hi>Augaean</hi> ſtable, than to remedy ſuch a cuſtomary and prevailing evil. Our freſh expectation is, that ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patriot will break through the difficulties of an obſtructive people, and force open a way for trade and commerce. Let our prayers and importunities preſs on all true-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patriots thus to advance the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. For this adventure is, without diſpute, ſure of a reward in heaven, and not only free from the envy of men, but alſo alwayes acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to deſerve everlaſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of glory. And thus alſo in the perſon of another (as under a fit vail of modeſty) I briefly hint unto you, what eſteem we do truly ow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your labours.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving imployed one day upon a long letter to you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Orchards and the Culture of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordſhire,</hi> and the Meſſenger being not yet gone, I ſhall now add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, or at leaſt ſumme up the reſult of my former diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The ground for an Orchard ſhould rather incline towards the South than towards the North: yet no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of niceneſſe in that point. They prove well towards the North. So rather towards the riſing Sun, than towards the Weſt. Yet the Weſt wind is the beſt, and the Weſtern Sun beſt ripening. And the blaſts commonly come from the full South, and about Noon: wherefore we pray with the Pſalmiſt, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the evil that flieth at Noontide.</p>
            <p>Yet a diligent obſerver may find that the hurtfull winds are apt to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52612:23"/>
into channels upon the ſurface of the earth, as the ſtreams of water do: and a man may find by his eye and reaſon, and ſee it confirmed by anniverſary experience, that at a miles diſtance one point of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens is far more agreeable, or more hurtfull than another, either by the conduct of hills and vales in the neighbourhood, or at diſtance, or by vapours ariſing from lakes, rivers, or mooriſh grounds, which by froſts are turned into blaſts. For we have confirm'd it into a proverb, that dry froſts do not blaſt, but moiſt froſts, and froſts following after rain do: and dampy grounds make froſts that would be drie in other places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moiſt in the neighbourhood. Alſo ſometimes in a very bottome the air is penn'd ſo cloſe, and the Suns heat ſo multiplyed by reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it is apt to gather the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern blaſts (which, as I ſaid, are the more frequent, and more hurtfull to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52612:23"/>
the nicer fruit, and to hops,) as in a furnace or oven.</p>
            <p>If the cruſt, or richer ſurface of the earth be near a foot deep, it is fully enough: and if the cruſt of the earth be deeper, yet I have ſeldome ſeen any of our ſtocks ſet more than a foot deep, except they be great ſtocks, which ſhould keep their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer depth.</p>
            <p>If the ground be equable, that is, in any proclivity relating towards a levell, then it is pity to ſtock it with naturall plants. The more expedite way were in <hi>October</hi> to ſettle crab-ſtocks at thirtie foot diſtance in the forementioned beſt order, <hi>per quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuncem</hi>: and after three yeares, the next following Spring, ſend for an Artiſt to graft them with the beſt fruit.</p>
            <p>The Crab-ſtocks ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the bigneſſe of a mans hand-wriſt: if bigger, 'tis leſſe apt to cloſe with the graft, and then the rain finds
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52612:24"/>
hole, to the danger of the ſtock. Our uſuall cuſtome was, upon the plain ſtock to ſet two or three grafts, which (for variety) might be different, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hazzard or dammage. Of late many do ſlope the ſtock for one onely grafte conceiving this the more certain way to unite the ſtock and graft fully and ſpeedily. In a Nurſery, if the ſtocks be as ſmall as twigs, the ſureſt and ſpeedieſt way is by the joynt-graft, where no leſſe than eight ſides are engaged, and this is an improvement of the laſt ſtamp.</p>
            <p>We cannot truſt to any Artiſt, but have need to uſe a true and carefull friend in the choice of grafts from the fruitfull branch of a ſound and fruitfull tree. And an errour in this point (beſides the miſtake of the fruit,) may prorogue the reward for five yeares or more, which is a ſad loſſe. <hi>Columella</hi>'s former note is worthy to be remembred in this point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52612:24"/>If the ground be very unequall, 'tis a great charge, and a very groſſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to levell it. For there is a kind of beauty, and a ſure refreſhment in a wilderneſſe; at leaſt it is a good ſoyl if appendant to a pleaſant garden. And it may be better, more kind, and more fruitfull, moſt certainly more fit for variety, and for all change of ſeaſons by inequality, than by equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And this is the ground that is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for the naturall apple, who is then wronged, maymed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he is hindered from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall courſe, or forced into order. Yet I ſhould not plant him in ſuch bottoms, where the water cannot paſſe away: the deſcent were beſt for his ſituation.</p>
            <p>The apples we commend for grafts, are the Stockin-apple, the Iellyflower-apple, the Well-apple, the Eliot, the Queen-crab, the Quince-apple, the Winter-quining, the Harvey, the William, the Lenard, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52612:25"/>
Iohn-apple, the Snouting, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the pearemain, and pippin, &amp; leather-coat. Theſe, and many more that are nameleſſe, are for the Table.</p>
            <p>For cider, the ſtreak't muſt is moſt commended; but tis but a kind of ſhrub or hedge-plant, not apt to grow to a large tree, and ſpending ſtrength ſo thick and ſo conſtantly, that the planter commonly ſurvives to ſee the decay of his own work. There is a white muſt, much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for a ſtrong luſty cider, the tree long laſting. Another white muſt hath this fault; they abide not on the tree, to be gathered together, but are alwayes dropping one after another.</p>
            <p>I need not note ſuch cautions as may affoord choice for all ſeaſons, early and late, and in the firſt ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ground to plant peares and apples alternatively, at leaſt if we have no certainty of the nature of the ground; and there is a beauty as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52612:25"/>
well as profit in variety: and peares grow long before they take up much room, and for the moſt part begin to be in perfection, when the grafted apple is decayed. Or a Winter-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which laſts longer, and growes ſlower, may be alternative to a cider-apple.</p>
            <p>The clay-land binds the tree faſter from wind-ſtrokes, the ſandy-land haſteneth the growth more. By rowes of Elmes every Orchard and Village is generally fenced from the North and North-Eaſt wind: yet no neceſſity.</p>
            <p>For Hops, we make haſt to be the chief hop-maſters in <hi>England</hi>; our Countrey having ſtore of Coppice-woods, and many provident men within theſe three yeares planting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the faireſt &amp; largeſt ſort of hops. All about <hi>Bromyard</hi> in a baſe ſoyl there is great ſtore. At firſt we adventured only upon deep, low, rich and mooriſh grounds: now we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52612:26"/>
climbe up the hills with wonderfull ſucceſſe. We find alſo that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are apt to gather heat as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as is aboveſaid) and that begets hony-dewes, when the more open air eſcapes it.</p>
            <p>Our Poets new and old, and all beſt judgements do highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the pleaſure of a Grove, <note rend="inter">Horat. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.</note>
               <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorum chorus omnis amat Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; fugit urbes.</hi> We do commonly deviſe a ſhadowy walk from our Gardens through our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards (which is the richeſt, ſweeteſt, and moſt embelliſht grove) into our Coppice-woods or Timber-woods. Thus we approach the reſemblance of Paradiſe, which God with his own perfect hand had appropriated for the delight of his innocent Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece. If a gap lyes in the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Orchard and Coppice, we fill up the vacancy with the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall help of a hop-yard. Where a buſy weed gives the ſhape of a wood.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52612:26"/>
This muſt content us, 'till we can gain the credit of a Vineyard, which as yet hangs between hope and fear. The late dry Summers did ſwell us with hopes; the later fickle Spring &amp; moiſt Autumn did blaſt, or drown our expectation.</p>
            <p>Some ſow acorns, and aſh keyes, and other ſeeds for Woods, in wild and hilly grounds. Others count it much better to plant quick-ſets, which make more haſt, and may be more reducible to the beauty of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Before we adventure for Woods upon untryed ground, 'tis not amiſs to make uſe of Sr. <hi>Hugh Plats</hi> his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur. My ſelf having bought a ſmall tenement, thought it worth the while to ſee the nature of mine own land, for nine foot depth, which was ſoon done. By that I found where ſand, where ſtone, and where marle of the beſt ſort were neereſt at hand: I found the reaſon why
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52612:27"/>
one piece of arable was more cold and moiſt, and leſſe fruitfull than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>We have a belief, that the moſt barren ſurface hath the richeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes, not only of metallick Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, but alſo of ſtone, yea of marle, or ſome other rich materiall. And this is certain, that which we eſteem the richeſt land, &amp; buy it at the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rate by far, that is in many reſpects the pooreſt land: as for example, our richeſt land is eſteemed to be on <hi>Frome</hi> banks, the paſture very rich, the arable a ſtiff clay bearing the beſt wheat; yet this clay is very unkind for Gardens, it does devour much compoſt. It is a ſlow ground for Orchards; the arable is much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to mildewes: if we have need to turn it into paſtures, though we have great advantages of land-flouds, or other fat waters, and the ground ſeem very likely for paſture, yet it is almoſt as good to give it away, as to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52612:27"/>
go about to turn it into paſture. I have ſeen, that in twenty yeares it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not a turf, or ſward. Yea lately, the want of winter-flouds two years together left the beſt paſtures as bare, hard, ſtarvy, chapt and cheany, as the baſeſt land on the <hi>Welſh</hi> mountains. And if the arable be there once out of heart, or miſſe of one courſe of plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is coſtly work to recover it.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, in many places of the hot rye-land, where the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures have a courſe ſea-green blade, or ſhort and poor, and where the fields refuſe wheat, peaſe, and fitches, there ſheep thrive beſt, and their dung ſuddenly recovers the arable, which is light, and eaſie for a weak team: in three or four yeares 'tis at the beſt for ſuch paſture as it proves. The paſtures quickly improved by fatting ſheep there, that may ly upon it night and day. The land quick for Orchards, or any ſort of trees, as well the talleſt Elmes, as the Aſh: eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52612:28"/>
ſitted for Gardens, for hemp, flax, turneps, parſnips, &amp;c. Hence you may judge which of theſe were more worthy to be called the richer land: if the rich water-flouds did not give the rich paſtures the advantage on one ſide. And hence you may ſee what a prevalency there is in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of paſture onely.</p>
            <p>I have ſeldome ſeen paſtures for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Compoſt in this Countrey, as I have ſeen it elſewhere. Onely in the Winter we feed our cattel on the higher paſtures, and in the hazzard of a rot, ſome follow the directions of <hi>Gabriel Plats,</hi> in putting out their ſheep all nights; which hath proved a ſafeguard to the ſheep, and a great help to the paſture. Other helps of paſture we do not omit, every rill of water is carefully conducted to the beſt uſe. If it runs from a fat ſtream, land-floud, or lime-ſtone, we finde benefit in it, if withall we let it paſſe over and away, before it exchangeth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52612:28"/>
it's fatneſſe into a cold hunger, which falls out in very few dayes. Some water we find ſo hungry, that we dare not receive it, but at ſeaſons of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Lime we have ſeldome try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon paſture. Aſhes we find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to beget the white and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hony-ſuckle, if ſifted on the ground in <hi>February,</hi> till it hath half candyed the ground, like a hoare-froſt. Our beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> hay-ſeed is by experience found to be our more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall friend.</p>
            <p>Our graſiers, which are butchers, do find this fault in the excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſtored with gilt-cups, which is a kind of crowfoot, that it makes the fat of their beef look yellow, as if it were of an old beef.</p>
            <p>The hony-ſuckle and delicate graſſe we ſort for cowes, the ſowrer for the breed of young cattel, the harder and ſtronger for labouring Oxen; and if it be rough, and little better than ſheep-paſture, tis the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52612:29"/>
for Horſes, to mend the breed of them for the ſaddle. In an hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall exceſſe, for the ſuller illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I may ſay, that a Nag fed upon high grounds and dry grounds is, for travell, as much beyond a Nag I bred in the lower medows, as a lion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth a cow in activity. For a bag to market, or a cart, you may breed them in the lower meadows, &amp; you ſhall ſee them big-limm'd, well-truſs't, &amp; apt to tire themſelves with their own bulk and weight. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that are bred on dry-ground, are airy and ſinewy, full of ſpirits and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, in ſhape like the barbe: they rid ground, and gather courage and delight in their own ſpeed. Thus colts well choſen, and ſheep well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, may be a rich help to repair the diſtreſſes of dry paſture.</p>
            <p>For ſheep we are skill'd beyond the rules of <hi>Gab. Plats.</hi> Our wooll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fineſt of <hi>England,</hi> and our ſheep ſmall, and not bearing above
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52612:29"/>
16. ounces ordinarily, (yet I have ſeen our faireſt Weathers bear thirty ounces of wooll) being ſmall and nice, they are generally houſed by night, Summer and Winter. And are therefore liable to two kinds of rot: the one is onely of the liver at firſt, and if it be diſcerned, tis cured by the butchers knife, without much loſſe to the owner; the other rot prevails over the whole body of the ſheep, &amp; makes the fleſh ſit for nothing but dogs. I know ſome places, in which there hath not been a rot in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of any of the inhabitants; but there they change often, becauſe the ground is very ſtony, and in two or three years wears out their mouthes: And nothing preſerves ſheep better than change of ſoyl. Our common husbandmen keep their ſmall flocks at all adventure without much care or caution. But for larger flocks our ſhepheards of <hi>Lemsters-oer</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinfield</hi> are moſt incomparably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52612:30"/>Whilſt this letter is under my hand, by a conference with Mr. <hi>S.</hi> concerning Orchards, I am aſſured, that upon a long trial (as in a way of conteſtation) it was found experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, that ſome apples raiſed of ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels did exceed the beſt that could be found of grafted apples in delicacy of taſt.</p>
            <p>That he tried to meliorate the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Codling, by a graft of the ſame kind, and it proved worſe.</p>
            <p>That a near neighbour made a hogſhead of cider of <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings onely: he taſted it this very week. It had a taſt far differing from all our other cider, not bad, nor very excellent. That it looks like perry, of a wheyiſh colour.</p>
            <p>He alſo gave me at his own houſe a moſt pleaſant drink, which I thought to be cider, and preferr'd it before red-ſtrak't cider, which was of the beſt, and, for triall, brought out to me and others at the ſame time.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52612:30"/>
This commended drink was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of crabs never hoorded, but ſhaken from the tree, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ground together with perry of that luſhious kind, which at this time of the year is alwayes wont to be roapy. This drink was not clear, but had ſome reſemblance of roapy perry. But he aſſures, that the crab does by this compoſition alwayes preſerve the perry from being roapy. If ſo (as of all men I can beſt believe him, who will not break his word to ſave his life) this is an excellent art, at one time to make Crabs, which grow naturally in all wild, dry, and barren ſoyl, a rich fruit; and by them alſo to make a rich benefit of thoſe peares, which in the language of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother good husband were called a Cumberſome Weed.</p>
            <p>He preſcribeth, that the more luſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the peare be, the more crabs be added to it. By the taſt in the mill, you may fit it, generally more peares
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52612:31"/>
than crabs. He noteth that theſe crabs were not of the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Bromsbury</hi> crabs, but common crabs: of which common crabs he advertiſeth there are two ſorts. The firſt ſoon ripe, and yellowiſh, and fit to be mingled with the peares that are firſt ripe. And of this kind was the cider that he gave to us. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a more ſullen crab, green about the end of Autumn. This agrees with it's contemporary peares. Or to make a kind of <hi>Scythian</hi> wine, fit to quicken the palat of a ſturdy hinde, they may be laid in heaps, for a months hoording, and then ground by themſelves, or with Winter-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. We know how welcome to forreign peaſants, and alſo to our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a rough vinegar or verjuice would be, either to mingle with pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or with water for drink. We have not yet felt ſo much want in <hi>England,</hi> as were neceſſary to teach us the uſe of crabs, or other generall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52612:31"/>
branches of frugality. The <hi>Bromsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Crab, ſo often mentioned, is far larger than either of the other ſort, and in ſhape like an apple.</p>
            <p>Sir, 'Tis time I ſhould now give you reſt. In this you may ſee my hearty deſires towards the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wellfare of our Native Countrey. If we muſt be hindered of Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> I wiſh our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> indignation would ſcorn to feed at their tables, to drink of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, or otherwiſe to borrow or buy of them, or of any of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, as long as our native ſoyle did ſupply us with neceſſaries. I pray God to ſtrenghthen us all in a firm love to his holy truth, and in a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love to each other, under the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his everlaſting Mercies.</p>

               <p>I dare not adventure for an exact tranſlation, having no other edition but that of <hi>Hieron. Commeline</hi> 1595, which is ſo full of errours, that I ſuſpect every line.
