            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable <hi>JAMES</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Poem being the last which I intend for the Theatre, ought to have the same Provision made for it, which Old Men make for their youngest Child, which is commonly a Favourite: They who were born before it carry away the Patrimony by Right of Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. This is to make its Fortune in the World; and since I can do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for it, Natural Affection calls upon me to put it out, at least, into the best service which I can procure for it. And as it is the usual practice of our decay'd Gentry, to look about them for some Illustrious Family, and there endeavour to fix their young Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, where he may be both well Educated, and Supported: I have herein also follow'd the Custom of the World, and am satisfi'd in my Judgment, that I cou'd not have made a more Worthy Choice. 'Tis true, I am not vain enough to think that any thing of mine can in any measure be worthy of Your Lordship's Patronage: and yet I shou'd be asham'd to leave the Stage, without some acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of your former Favours, which I have more than once experienc'd. Besides the Honour of my Wife's Relation to Your Noble House, to which my Sons may plead some Title, though I cannot; You have been pleas'd to take a particular notice of me, even in this lowness of my Fortunes, to which I have voluntarily reduc'd my self: and of which I have no reason to be asham'd.
<pb facs="tcp:48939:5"/>
This Condescension, my Lord, is not only becoming of Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family, but of Your Personal Character in the World. And if I value my self the more for your Indulgence to me, and your Opinion of me; 'tis because any thing which you like, ought to be consider'd as something in it self. And therefore I must not undervalue my present Labours, because I have presum'd to make you my Patron. A Man may be just to himself, tho he ought not to be partial. And I dare affirm, that the several Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which I have given to the Persons of this <hi>Drama,</hi> are truly drawn from Nature; all perfectly distinguish'd from each other. That the Fable is not injudiciously contriv'd; that the turns of Fortune are not manag'd unartfully; and that the last Revolution is happily enough invented. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I acknowledge, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that the Catastrophe which is made from the change of Will is not of the first Order for Beauty: but it may reasonably be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, in defence of this Play, as well as of the <hi>Cinna</hi> (which I take to be the very best of <hi>Corneille's</hi>) that the Philosopher who made the Rule, copy'd all the Laws, which he gave for the <hi>Theatre,</hi> from the Authorities and Examples of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, which he had read: And from their Poverty of Invention he cou'd get nothing but mean Conclusions of wretched Tales: where the mind of the chief Actor was for the most part chang'd without Art or Preparation; only because the Poet could not otherwise end his Play. Had it been possible for <hi>Aristotle</hi> to have seen the <hi>Cinna,</hi> I am confident he would have alter'd his Opinion; and concluded, that a simple change of Will might be manag'd with so much Judgment, as to render it the most agreeable, as well as the most surprising part of the whole Fable: Let <hi>D'acier,</hi> and all the rest of the Modern Criticks, who are too much Bigotted to the Ancients, contend never so much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I was afraid that I had been the Inventor of a new sort of designing, when in my Third Act, I make a discovery of my <hi>Alphonso's</hi> true Parentage. If it were so, what wonder had it been, that Dramatick Poetry, tho a limited Art, yet might be capable of receiving some Innovations for the better. But afterwards I casually found, that <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> in the <hi>Heauton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timoroumenos,</hi> had been before me; and made the same kind of discovery in the same Act. As for the Mechanick Vnities, that of Time is much within the compass of an Astrological Day, which begins
<pb facs="tcp:48939:5"/>
at Twelve, and ends at the same hour the Day following. That of Place is not observ'd so justly by me, as by the Ancients; for their Scene was always one, and almost constantly some Publick Place. Some of the late <hi>French</hi> Poets, and amongst the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> my most Ingenious Friend, Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> have observ'd this Rule strictly; though the Place was not altogether so publick as a Street. I have follow'd the Example of <hi>Corneille,</hi> and stretch'd the Latitude to a Street and Palace, not far distant from each other in the same City. They who will not allow this Liberty to a Poet, make it a very ridiculous thing, for an Audience to suppose themselves, sometimes to be in a Field, sometimes in a Garden, and at other times in a Chamber. There are not indeed so many Absurdities in their Supposition, as in ours; but 'tis an Original Absurdity, for the Audience to suppose themselves to be in any other place, than in the very <hi>Theatre,</hi> in which they sit; which is neither Chamber, nor Garden, nor yet a Publick Place of any Business, but that of the Representation. For my Action, 'tis evidently dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and in that I have most of the Ancients for my Examples. Yet I dare not defend th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> way by Reason, much less by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for their Actions, though double, were of the same Species; that is to say, in their <hi>Comedies</hi> two Amours: And their Persons were better link'd in Interests than mine. Yet even this is a fault which I shou'd often practise, if I were to write again; because 'tis agreeable to the <hi>English Genius.</hi> We love variety more than any other Nation; and so long as the Audience will not be pleas'd without it, the Poet is oblig'd to humour them. On condition they were cur'd of this publick Vice, I cou'd be content to change my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and gladly give them a more reasonable Pleasure. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, my Lord, is not altogether to the purpose of an Epistle Dedicatory: Yet 'tis expected that somewhat shou'd be said even here, in relation to <hi>Criticisme;</hi> at least in Vindication of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, that you may not be desir'd to Partronize a Poem which is wholly unworthy of your Protection. Tho, after all, I doubt not but some will liken me to the Lover in a Modern Comedy, who was combing his Peruke, and setting his Cravat before his Mistress; and being ask'd by her, when he intended to begin his Court? reply'd, he had been doing it all this while. Yet thus it happens, my Lord, that <hi>Self</hi> will come into all Addresses of this Nature, tho 'tis the
<pb facs="tcp:48939:6"/>
most unmannerly word of the World in civil Conversation, and the most ungrateful to all Hearers. For which reason, I, who have nothing to boast of, but my Misfortunes, ought to be the first to banish it. Especially since I have so large a Field before me, as Your Inborn Goodness, Your Evenness of Temper, Your Humility in so ample a share of Fortune as you possess; Your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to all Men, and Your Kindness to your Friends: Besides Your Natural and Acquir'd Endowments, and Your Brotherly Love to Your Relations. <hi>Notus in Fratres animo Paterno,</hi> was the great Commendation which <hi>Horace</hi> gave to one of his Patrons: And 'tis that Praise which particularly Crowns your other Vertues. But here, my Lord, I am oblig'd in common Prudence to stop short; and to cast under a Veil some other of your Praises, as the Chymists use to shadow the Secret of their great Elixir; lest if it were made publick, the World shou'd make a bad use of it. To enjoy our own Quiet, without disturbing that of others, is the practice of every Moral Man: And for the rest, to live chearfully and splendidly, as it is becoming of Your Illustrious Birth, so 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to thank God for his Benefits in the best manner. 'Tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary to wish you more Worldly Happiness, or Content of Mind, than you enjoy: But the continuance of both, to Your Self, and Your Posterity, is earnestly desir'd by all who have the Honour to be known to You, and more particularly by,</p>

               <l>Intends to gratifie the present Age.</l>
               <l>One Warrant shall be Sign'd for every Man;</l>

               <l>And you be Wits, but to your selves alone.</l>
               <l>Provided too; you rail at one another:</l>
               <l>For there's no one Wit, will allow a Brother.</l>
               <l>Provided also; that you spare this Story,</l>
               <l>Damn all the Plays that e're shall come before ye.</l>
               <l>If one by chance prove good in half a score,</l>
               <l>Let that one pay for all; and Damn it more.</l>
               <l>For if a good one scape among the Crew,</l>

               <l>Seeming to fan their Faces in cold Weather.</l>
               <l>But here's a Story which no Books relate;</l>
               <l>Coin'd from our own Old Poet's Addle-pate.</l>
               <l>The Fable has a Moral too, if sought:</l>
               <l>But let that go; for upon second Thought,</l>
               <l>He fears but few come hither to be Taught.</l>
               <l>Yet if you will be profited, you may;</l>
               <l>And he would Bribe you too, to like his Play.</l>
               <l>He Dies, at least to us, and to the Stage,</l>
               <l>And what he has, he leaves this Noble Age.</l>
               <l>He leaves you first, all Plays of his Inditing,</l>
               <l>The whole Estate, which he has got by Writing.</l>
               <l>The Beaux may think this nothing but vain Praise,</l>
               <l>They'l find it something; the Testator says:</l>
               <l>Tor half their Love, is made from scraps of Plays.</l>
               <l>To his worst Foes, he leaves his Honesty;</l>
               <l>That they may thrive upon't as much as he.</l>
               <l>He leaves his Manners to the Roaring Boys,</l>
               <l>Who come in Drunk, and fill the House with noise.</l>
               <l>He leaves to the dire Critiques of his Wit,</l>
               <l>His Silence and Contempt of all they Writ.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Critique, he bequeaths the Curse,</l>
               <l>To find his faults; and yet himself make worse.</l>
               <l>A precious Reader in Poetique Schools,</l>

Well, these Monarchs make no more of us Souldiers, when their turn is serv'd, than we make of our old batter'd Horses; to put us off for Stallions, is the best that can become of us: and those indeed are my present Circumstances: <hi>Dalinda</hi> will none, and <hi>Sancho</hi> is just mounting; if I get not between, and thrust him off: for which purpose I have insinuated to him that I have left <hi>Dalinda</hi> for his sake, and am upon another Scent,‚ÄîYonder he comes: This, and another Lye which I have ready coin'd, will go near to spoil his Market.</p>

               <p>You speak more truly than you think: I have shewn it. For, since I must confess the Truth to you, I am no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: my Father, tho' he bears it high to put me off, has Mortgag'd his Estate: We keep Servants for shew, and when we shou'd pay their wages, pick a Quarrel with their Service, and turn 'em off Pennyless. There's neither Sheet nor Shirt in the whole Family; the Lodging Rooms are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht with Loam: and bare Mattresses are the Beds. The Dining Room, plays the Hypocrite for all the House; for all the Furniture is there: when Strangers Dine with us, we Eat before the Servants, and then they Fast; but when we Dine alone, 'tis all a muss: They scramble for the Victuals, before 'tis serv'd up, and then we Fast.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>NOW, in Good Manners, nothing shou'd be sed</l>
               <l>Against this Play, because the Poet's dead.</l>
               <l>The Prologue told us of a Moral here:</l>
               <l>Wou'd I cou'd find it, but the Devil knows where.</l>
               <l>If in my Part it lyes, I fear he means</l>
               <l>To warn us of the Sparks behind our Scenes:</l>
               <l>For if you'l take it on <hi>Dalinda's</hi> Word,</l>
               <l>'Tis a hard Chapter to refuse a Lord.</l>
               <l>The Poet might pretend this Moral too,</l>
               <l>That when a Wit and Fool together woo;</l>
               <l>The Damsel (not to break an Ancient Rule,)</l>
               <l>Shou'd leave the Wit, and take the Wealthy Fool.</l>
               <l>This he might mean, but there's a Truth behind,</l>
               <l>And since it touches none of all our Kind,</l>
               <l>But Masks and Misses; faith, I'le speak my Mind.</l>
               <l>What, if he Taught our Sex more cautious Carriage,</l>
               <l>And not to be too Coming before Marriage:</l>
               <l>For fear of my Misfortune in the Play,</l>
               <l>A Kid brought home upon the Wedding day:</l>
               <l>I fear there are few <hi>Sancho's</hi> in the Pit,</l>
               <l>So good as to forgive, and to forget;</l>
               <l>That will, like him, restore us into Favour,</l>
               <l>And take us after on our good Behaviour.</l>
               <l>Few, when they find the Mony Bag is rent,</l>
               <l>Will take it for good Payment on content.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48939:50"/>
But in the Telling, there the difference is,</l>
               <l>Sometimes they find it more than they cou'd wish.</l>
               <l>Therefore be warn'd, you Misses and you Masks,</l>
               <l>Look to your hits, nor give the first that asks.</l>
               <l>Tears, Sighs, and Oaths, no truth of Passion prove,</l>
               <l>True Settlement alone, declares true Love.</l>
               <l>For him that Weds a Puss, who kept her first,</l>
               <l>I say but little, but I doubt the worst:</l>
               <l>The Wife that was a Cat may mind her house,</l>
               <l>And prove an Honest, and a Careful Spouse;</l>
               <l>But faith I wou'd not trust her with a Mouse.</l>
