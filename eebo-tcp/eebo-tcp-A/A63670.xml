            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NEver since GOD had first beene pleased to shew his mercies towards us, was it knowne, that pernitious and nefarious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders against his Church and elect, have escaped unpunished. Never have Conspirators gone undiscerned, ill members unconvicted; and generally no matter, manner, plot or conspiracie whatsoever, against Religion, remained unconcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but have (through his wonderfull means) pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably appeared to the attaching and punishing of the offenders, the terrour of malevolent and evill-minded persons, and the glory of Almighty God, the revealer of secrets. This no lesse then other, is worthy of your perspicuous apprehension. The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> whose iudicious understanding, if well applied, might have both much advantaged, and also extended to the setling of a generall and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished

peace in this kingdome, proving a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, and flying the iust iudgement and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Parliament against him, first attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a transportation for Ireland, reduced himselfe into the County of Carmarthen, where many dayes being vigilant, and wayting for opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being still frustrated, in respect that the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments most iudicious command denied any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce thitherward, without their speciall licence, he resolved of another, as hee thought more auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, was to returne for France; where, amongst hi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

This setled in his opinion, hee sets forward to sea in a French Bark, called <hi>le Olive Shampaneell,</hi> where although his desires were earnest, and expected a sudden tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportation; yet the winde proving inauspitious, and the Sea very turbulent, hee was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine upon the waves for the space of eight daies upon the coast of Wales: whereas it fortuned Sir <hi>Iohn Penington,</hi> Vice Admirall of his Maiesties Fleet, likewise to ride; who having divers times taken a view of him, and knowing him by reason of former acquaintance, attached him, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him into his ship, where hee is detained as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner untill further order should be given from the Parliament concerning the same.</p>

            <head>A RELATION OF THE ENTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment given to the Gentleman sent by the Parliament to be governour of <hi>Hull,</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">VVith his garrison of three hundred men, and their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same, as also their willing acceptance of my Lord of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> sent with a Commission from his Maiesty.</head>
            <p>VPon the tenth day of Ianuary last past, a Gentleman anthorized by the Parliament to undertake the government and vigilant care of the Towne of <hi>Hull,</hi> with three hundred able men for that purpose, set forward in their iourney towards the County of Yorke: where arrived, the inhabitants of the said Towne denied him entrance within the walles, notwithstanding hee produced the command from the Honorable House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to that effect. But after some time spent in mature consideration, they admitted him, but not his men, alledging that the Fort being his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties, he having there also a Magazine, the power and custody thereof ought not to bee conferd and delivered over unto any, without his Maiesties spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial commission authorizing some Noble and well knowne Common-wealths-man by it, otherwise they were not bound, neither would they deliver it up to any; but if he pleased to view their Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Magazine, and what strength they had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, he should and made no question but hee
<pb facs="tcp:62140:4"/>
should finde both it and them sufficient an able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to withstand any forraigne force or enemy in defence and safeguard of the same.</p>
            <p>Thus answered, hee deprrted; and came to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, since when the Earle of Newcastle authorized by his Maiesties commission, and attended with a traine of five hundred assistants, was generally and ioyfully received of the inhabitants, where he hath supplied his Maiesties Magazens and Block-houses (where it was wanting) with powder, shot, bullets, both for Canon and Musket,: hee hath also moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the peeces of Ordnances; raised platformes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified all defaults, whether in carriages or Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeces, and is now continually re-edifying and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fortifications formerly built there, his endeavours, and so generally thought for the good of this Kingdome, that wee daily wish a greater multiplication of such loyall subiects. He is a man so generally fraught with vertue, and so industrious in the effectation of his present commission, that neither being mis-led to vice, nor losing opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the proceeding in his importunate affairs, that he may be a paterne of emulation for hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The maner and plantation of the Ordnance is thus described.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Blockhouse standing towards the East, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning to the Sea, hath twenty peeces; five whole Canons, and fifteen Demicanons and Culverings: the other towards North-east, having ten peeces, whereof three are Culverings, the residue small peeces, and mounted with an aspect over the whole Towne for defence by land, two murderers at Gray
<pb facs="tcp:62140:5"/>
wharfe, and two more at Dilham Port, all made ready and fit for service: there being in the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines Armes for an hundred thousand men.</p>
            <p>These are the endevours of the worthy Earle of Newcastle, which we wish to continue both there and other places in this kingdome by him and such other like good agents, to the honour and glory of God, terrifying our enemies, our owne safety, and hopes of ensuing tranquility. <hi>Amen.</hi>
