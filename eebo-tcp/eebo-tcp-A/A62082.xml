            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the Ocean, and range about
strange Coasts to increase the number
of his Poetical Parasits, so with his Fish
Knight Errantry, he rushed through
the Straits, and turned his snout towards the North,
where in half a dayes swiming he reached the Coast of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> without any mischance, except a slender crack
in his <hi>Lerbord</hi> Finn that he got as he passed by the
Birling Islands; This did not at all startle him from
his Course to the Artick Pole, but most jocundly held on
till he came to the Bay of <hi>Biscay,</hi> where indeed his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

was fair to have gasped his last, with great difficulty he
rolled through that raging Gulffe, and no sooner came

his Crist, brandished his Triton with as dreadfull and
huffing an Aspect as the Ale-house <hi>Hectors</hi> will tosse

in this posture and rate he sneered away, seeeking for

by his snotty Beard, that he was a <hi>Hollander</hi>
come from <hi>Malago,</hi> drunk with Peettersemin, and to
chastise his intemperance, because it was not done with
Metheglin, he immediately from his Fore castle snuffed
a cast of Culverins, which did so smite the aquatick

to spend his Bowspreet upon the Cardinal Islands, and
if happly Monsiur de <hi>Fonquets</hi> Gallies of <hi>Bell</hi>-Isle had
