            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He picture of <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi>
(one of the
rareſt peeces of
antiquity) goeing
to be ſacrifiſed for
<pb facs="tcp:31982:2"/>
appeaſing the anger of <hi>Diana</hi>
offended with her Father <hi>King
Agamemnon</hi> for killing a ſtagg
conſecrated to that Goddeſs,
made <hi>Timanthes</hi> the Author
therof very famous. Hee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in lively cullors, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this faire <hi>Princes,</hi> her Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Frinds, Allyes, and ſuite
in great Conſternation, all
drown'd in lamentations and
teares; but the gallant Lady
(nothing in nature appear'd
more comly) ſmiled, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her countenance a
Majeſty, and contempt of
death: ſoe charming was the
art of this picture, that few
<pb facs="tcp:31982:2"/>
could view it without tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this Preface hath
drawne another <hi>Iphigenia</hi> of
the body of a noble, ancient
Catholick Nation cla'd all in
redd Robes, not to bee now
offered up as victime; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſacrific'd, not to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Deity, but to the living
<hi>God</hi> for holy Religion: look
but on this our bleeding <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia,</hi>
and I dare ſay you will
lament her Tragedy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſets downe his owne
feare and care about long E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
<pb facs="tcp:31982:3"/>
(which should be the
chiefeſt care of a Chriſtian)
confeſſing with griefe and
compunction of hart, that hee
had walk'd in daunger, even
to the age of 71. years, and at
length found himſelfe touch't
with that dreadfull theme:
<hi>Aut paenitendum aut ardendum.</hi>
That is: <hi>Either wee muſt doe
pennance, or burne.</hi> This drove
him to a reſolution of laying
aſide all wordly intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and converſations, for
obtaining the Kingdome of
heaven and taking order with
the houſe of his Soule, for
that hee was ſure to dye,
<pb facs="tcp:31982:3"/>
and could not live longe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hee expreſſes a Godly
anger againſt his frind<hi>Sall</hi>  an
Apoſtata. <hi>Sanctè Iraſcitur qui
pro Deo Iraſcitur. </hi>hat is: <hi>THee
is juſtly Angry, that is angry for
Gods Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hee delivers in ſencible
Language the ſlavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruine,
and diſtruction of his deare
Country.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hee preſents to the view
of our gratious <hi>King Charles</hi>
the ſecond a Catholick People,
his faithfull ſubjects wounded
by theeves, and left halfe dead,
like the miſerable man, that
went from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Ierico;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:31982:4"/>
deſiring his <hi>Majeſty</hi> with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and teares to com neare
and binde up rhe wounds of
the afflicted, powring in Oyle
and Wine, as did de Godly
<hi>Semaritane.</hi> His Language to
the King is with ſubmiſſive
duty, and yet with a <hi>Prieſtly</hi>
freedome Iudging with <hi>Saint
Ambroſe. Neque imperiale eſt
libertatem dicendi denegare, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
Sacerdotale, quod ſentiat,
non dicere.</hi> That is: <hi>It is neyther
Kingly to deny the freedome of
ſpeaking, nor Prieſtly, not to ſpeake
what hee thinks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Hee names in particulare
certaine Capitall, Implacable,
<pb facs="tcp:31982:4"/>
blooddy Enemyes of his
Country, and gives them the
Caracters, they deſerve: and
to juſtify this, ſays with <hi>Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liane,
In hoſtem Patriae, omnis
homo miles eſt.</hi> That is: <hi>Every
man is a Souldier againſt the enemy
of his Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſubject of his writing
was to reprove <hi>Sall</hi> a <hi>Ieſuit of
the Fourth Vow,</hi> for abjuring
the Catholick Faith, and leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his holy Order: In the
work hee proceeded to 8. or
9. Chapters, and went noe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but I hope ſome zealous
<hi>Iſraelite</hi> will build upon the
foundation hee hath laid,
<pb facs="tcp:31982:5"/>
a handſome ſtructure.</p>
            <p>You will perhaps inquire
who hee is that began, and did
not finish a good work; hee
is a learned worthy <hi>Prieſt,</hi> of
whome, all that know him,
will ſay, (his modeſty may
not be offended with the
trueth's I utter) hee hath beene
all his life tyme, ſincere in all
his writings, ways, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
(Hee is truly one
of thoſe can ſay with <hi>Seneca:
Quod ſentimus loquimur, &amp; quod
loquimur ſentimus.</hi> That is: <hi>I
thinke what I ſpeake, and ſpeake
what I thinke.)</hi> Ever Loyall to
his <hi>Prince,</hi> faithfull to his
<pb facs="tcp:31982:5"/>
Country, and true to his frind;
and ſoe harty a lover of peace,
with all kinde of men; that
hee neuer ingag'd in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
but what was pious
for defending Religion, and
the Juriſdection of the holy
Sea: in quarrells of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hee was ſtill fervent, and
feared noe man, and uſed to
ſay with great <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in ſuch
incounters. <hi>Nemini facio inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,
ſi omnibus Deum praefero.</hi>
That is: <hi>I injure noe man by prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
God before all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having conſidered with
attention this ſound Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
and finding the contents
<pb facs="tcp:31982:6"/>
ſollid, well ordered, and ſuch

World; hoping that pious

wounds wee have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for God, and Religion,
from the Enemys of both, will
open the bowells of mercy to

            <p>I conclude with a word or
two to my deare Countrymen,
recommending ſeriously to
them all, at home and a broad,
to humble themſelves under
the Iudgments of <hi>God,</hi> and
powre forth theire harts like

for the ſpace
of full ſeaventy years
in this Babilon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and miſeryes,
(wherin men are ſoe
ſtrangely tormoyl'd,
that the pleaſures they enjoy, often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
theire greateſt torments.) I began
at length with a ſencible care to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Long <hi>Eternity,</hi> purpoſing, to lay
aſide all falſe contentment, deceiving
Illuſions, and prophaine converſations,
heavy Chains I haue carry'd to long
with ſmall pleaſure, and great feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
although I found great danger in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, yet I had not courage enough
to shake them of for good and all. <hi>Vere

            </p>
            <p>My declining age forewarning mee
the downfall of my decaying body would
be ſoon, and perhaps ſuddaine, bid mee
prepare for a ſurer, and a more durable
habitation; and it ſeemed to mee my
Guardian Angell whiſpered to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
ſoule even the ſame words the
Prophet Iſaie uttered to King Ezechias
when dangerously ſick.<note place="margin">Iſa. Cap. 38,</note> 
               <hi>Thus ſaith our
Lord: take order with thy houſe, for thou
ſhalt dye, and ſhalt not live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This inevitable alarme of dying ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a high ſtorme within mee, I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
without further fluctuation to ſpend
the short remnant of tyme I haue to live,
in pennance, Holy contemplation, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Mortification for ſchanſelling
with tears (if God would be ſoe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
the ſinns and vanitys of my former
life.</p>
            <p>I had hardly begun to ſettle my
minde in this devine meditation, when
behold a printed paper from London
came to hand, of a publick <hi>abjuration</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:31982:11"/>
the Roman Catholick faith made by
<hi>Andrew Sall</hi> a Ieſuit of the fourth <hi>Vow.</hi>
This paper indeed gave mee a great
heavineſs of hart, for I loved the man
dearly for his amiable nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
parts, and eſteemed him both
a pious perſon and Learned, and ſoe
did all that knew him, but I ſee wee
were all deceiu'd in him. However
this ſuddaine change of him made mee
ſay with a ſad attention thoſe words
of Saint Paul.<note place="margin">1. Cor. Cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to ſtand, let him take heed leaſt hee
fall.</hi> For God knowes I noe way
feared this man would have falen into
heriſy.</p>
            <p>As I was Reading with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
Sall's <hi>Abjuration</hi> I call'd to
minde that <hi>great read Dragon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. Cap. 12.</note> 
               <hi>whoſe
tayle drew the third part of the ſtarrs of
heauen, and caſt them to the earth.</hi> And
then ſaid to my ſelfe, the tayle of an
infernall beaſt had caſt this Sall to the
Earth out of a little heaven: <hi>(The
ſtate of Religion)</hi> wherin for a tyme,
hee shined like a ſmall ſtarr in
<pb facs="tcp:31982:12"/>
vertue, and learning.</p>
            <p>After deſerting the Socitey of Ieſus
and running away with infamy and
ſhame, out of the whole Houſe of
God I could not Endure him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſolued to give him a sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion:
at which if hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
and fall into Choller for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring
to doe him good, I shall
hould that for an ill Symptome of his
diſeaſe <hi>qui corripientem Eum contemnit</hi>
(ſaith Salomon) <hi>non ſequetur Eum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas.</hi>
Some ſick men there are, that
now and then think themſelves ſound
and well, when they are moſt ſick, all
thoſe can not abide the ſight of a
Doctor, which is a Kinde of madneſs:
if Sall be one of thoſe, his cure will
be the harder; however for Charity-ſake,
and for the ancient amity wee
had, I will Imploy all paynes, and
dilligence for healing him, but the cure
muſt come from aboue,<note place="margin">Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſy.</note>

cum S. Auguſtino Loquar) ſemper fenſui

how to handle Sall. <hi>Dilige,</hi> (ſaith hee)
<hi>&amp; dic quod voles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what shall I doe to a man, that
hath ſtained his ſoule with the ſpott
of heriſy? with what waters shall I
wash him for wyping away the ſtaine,
with thoſe of <hi>Siloe,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Had Sall's ſinn beene noe more then
a ſlipp of Ignorance, or frailty, wee
could have covered him with a Mantle
of Charity; but the abominable abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

Ghoſt, I can not be ſilent, but muſt
openly rebuke his wickedneſs, and
maintaine truth againſt him before all
the world: can I ſee aman deare to
mee, vaunting and ſoe deſperatly defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Hoſtes of the living God, and
ſay nothing? that cannot be: Silence
here were a great ſinne being the true
tyme of taking up Davids Sling and
ſtone and throwing at this Gyant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minering
and vaporing againſt the camp
of Iſraell. I am not to powre oyle
upon the head of ſuch a ſinner, flattery
will not cure him, I muſt then in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
chide him and Exprobrat his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting

is wiſe and penitent, hee will ſay with
repenting David.<note place="margin">Pſal. 140.</note> 
               <hi>The Juſt shall rebuke
mee in mercy, and shall reprehend mee:
but let not the oyle of a ſinner fatte my
head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After lamenting Sall's woefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
I begin to think of my deare
Contry's affliction, and with feare, and
amazement to inquire the ground and
cauſe of perſecution there and in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31982:13"/>
Nothing was leſs feared (I am
confident) by the Catholicks of both
Kingdoms then a tempeſt of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to come upon them, lying ſafe
(as they conceived) under the wings
of ſoe great and mercyfull a Monarck,
as Charles the ſecond, a King of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons.
How then ſay men came this
about? how could ſoe clement a King
be induced to afflict ſoe loyall a people,
as the Catholicks of England, and
Ireland? I ſee noe Miſtery in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
all is cleare: theire affliction,
and cauſe therof is well knowne over
all Europ, and is (as I may ſay) even
the ſame with that of innocent <hi>Daniell,</hi>
whoſe Loyall fidelity to <hi>Syrus</hi> King of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> was ſoe cleare, as his malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Enemys ſaid expreſsly of him,
wee shall not finde againſt this <hi>Daniell</hi>
any occaſion unleſs perhaps in the Law
of his God; the Crime then againſt
<hi>Daniell</hi> and all the Jews was theire Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
upon this ground the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers
and great men of the Kingdome
gott the King to ſett forth an Edict
<pb facs="tcp:31982:14"/>
againſt the Jewes for profeſſing theire
Religion, and by this means <hi>Daniell</hi>
was caſt into the lake of the Lyons by a
King that lou'd him. The King lou'd
<hi>Daniell</hi> but hee feared the great men,
who preſſed the Law to be executed
againſt <hi>Daniell,</hi> and this feare more
ſtrong in the King then love,
made poore <hi>Daniell</hi> Companion to the
Lyons.</p>
            <p>Your Religion noble Contry-men,
your Religion is the ſole Cryme, for
which you ſuffer: (Bleſſed for ever be
the name of God for this) your Religion
hath ſtirred up this tempeſt, which
ought not to terrifye you over much,
ſeeing the Apoſtles our firſt Captains
and Leaders in this holy cauſe, thoſe
darlings of God, endured hard things for
Religion: Priſons, whippings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumilies,
and all ſorts of vexations
were to them delights, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:<note place="margin">Act. Apl. cap. 5.</note>
they after <hi>being ſcurged went
from the ſight of the Councell rejoycing,
becauſe they were accounted worthy to ſuffer
reproach for the name of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31982:14"/>
Doe not therfore feare all that
men can doe againſt you, while with
tears and patience you march under the
purple Standart of Crucify'd Jeſus,
for in the end, the day, and victory
will be yours: feare not the power of
men in this glorious tryall, there be
more with you, then againſt you,
(Legions of Angells though you ſee
them not) thoſe heavenly hoſtes are
pitching theire tents round about
you. Hee that Led the Children of
Iſraell out of Egypt in wonders through
the redd Sea, neuer wants power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you: waite for his good tyme, for
hee will come.</p>
            <p>A Table of ſage Counſells, that
hung by the bed of <hi>Ptolomeus Arſaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
King of Egypt, (by him Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously

raigne,) was delivered by a Prieſt of

now <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi> deſiring ajuſt and

then ſuch a demaund? yet <hi>Orery</hi>
muſt quarrell with the contents of ſaid
letter, and beleh out poyſon againſt the
whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nation and theire Religion.
To this anſwer <hi>P. W.</hi> replyed and
ſolidly confuted <hi>Orery:</hi> lett the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Reader after deliberation
Iudge of which ſide truth, ſollid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and learning is in the writings of

               <p>It vexed <hi>Orery</hi> above all meaſure
that <hi>P. W.</hi> advanced theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.
1. That the worſt of the
<hi>Irish</hi> Papiſts were no Regicids, 2. That
<pb facs="tcp:31982:18"/>
the <hi>Irish</hi> Papiſts fought againſt ſuch
men, when <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and the
Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> deſerted the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yall
cauſe.</p>
               <p>To the firſt <hi>Orery</hi> makes this pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
anſwer. <hi>That the Iriſh Papiſts are no
Regicids; let it be conſidered, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin
of Regicids is common in Romish Schools,
and the practice in theire courts.</hi> This is a
falſe Calamny, tell us <hi>Orery</hi> in what
Romish Univerſity or School is this
Doctrin Common? in what Catholick
Court is this practice? you can not tell
us, and therfore you are convinced of
Calumniating Catholick Schools, and
Courts, which is no creditt for
you.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme wee demaund
<hi>Orery</hi> in what School was the Doctrin
had, by which <hi>Crumwell</hi> and the rabble
of blooddy Rebells murthered the good
<hi>King Charles the firſt,</hi> in the School of
<hi>Geneve</hi> or <hi>Rome?</hi> Speak freely your
minde, and tell us on what ſide were
you when the King was murthered, of
<hi>Crumwells</hi> party or the <hi>Kings?</hi> of <hi>Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:31982:19"/>
party you were then, and had you
been then in <hi>London</hi> likely (this is the
opinion of many) you had been a high
man in that blooddy jury; and after that
<hi>Kings</hi> death noe man deſired more (as
was generally ſpoken of you) to King
<hi>Crumwell,</hi> and unKing our preſent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
then you.</p>
               <p>To <hi>P. W.</hi> his ſecond propoſition you
anſwer thus. <hi>That to touch the annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
is virtually to touch the annoynted, take
away the regalia, and in effect you take
away the King. Orery</hi> all this is true, but
what Illation make you of this? who I
pray are thoſe that touched the <hi>annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
and the <hi>annoynted,</hi> the Catholicks of
<hi>Ireland;</hi> or <hi>Cromwells</hi> party? (whoſe
faithfull <hi>Ianniſer</hi> you haue been.) The
annoyntings you haue touch'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
all the <hi>Regalia,</hi> the <hi>Kings Cittys,
Townes, Forts, Militia,</hi> and for addition
to your treaſon you made open warre
againſt the <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> (it was
<hi>Crumwell</hi> and you all touched then the
<hi>annoynted</hi> virtually) and here you ſtayd
not, but touch'd the annoynted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
<pb facs="tcp:31982:19"/>
when you put him to death by an
unheard and moſt blooddy ſolemnity,
and as it were by Iuſtice or courſe of law,
an aſacinate, that hath contaminated
the glory of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> though
the beſt and moſt of the <hi>Peers</hi> and good
people of <hi>England</hi> abhorr'd it. Your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this ſecond propoſition you
conclude thus. <hi>Had the Devill had leave
to touch Jobs perſon, hee would not haue
ſpar'd him, when hee touch'd all that was
his.</hi> You ſay right <hi>Orery;</hi> but what
ſay you to this; that you and your
Companions after touching all that
was the <hi>Kings,</hi> have touched his ſacred
perſon, and Barbarouſly kill'd him.
See and recken among your ſelves,
what Kinde of Divells you were then,
and if you haue not gon a ſtepp farther
againſt your owne <hi>King,</hi> then the Divell
did againſt <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orery</hi> you might take us for men
of short memory, if wee should forgett,
how you by a way of rallery ſaid of
54. Catholick Gentlemen <hi>Nominees,</hi> that
were to be reſtored, (and made account
<pb facs="tcp:31982:20"/>
they should be ſoe) to theire chief
houſes, and 2000. Akers of ground,
that it was intended by the act, they
should be only <hi>Nominees, Nomine</hi> reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but not <hi>re.</hi> You have play'd the
Prophett <hi>Orery</hi> (though you ſpake in
a leering way) for as yet none of them
have been reſtored, (as wee are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
nor likely shall; yett at that
tyme you abuſed the Kings goodneſs and
credulity, aſſuring his Majeſty, there
was a ſufficient ſtock of repriſalls to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
all.</p>
               <p>After taking ſome paines, in reading

Elaborated piece, but full of

and ſophiſtry; all his ſtudy and paynes
tend to render the Catholicks of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

hee showes in his writings a bitter

(I owe not ſoe much to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
as to ſpare telling him truth, nor
want I confidence to defend truth, and
my Country, againſt a perſon of higher
quality then hee is.) Neuer came in
my way an Author, that writes of a
whole Nation, and theire Religion,
leſs Chriſtianly, leſs nobly, and leſs
truly; and for his paynes hee is worthy
of the praiſe <hi>S. Anguſtin</hi> gives to ſuch

               </p>
               <p>Upon <hi>a Bull</hi> of <hi>Vrbanus 8. to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Catholicks of Ireland</hi> Anno 1643.
he makes a mocking malicious coment.
This <hi>Bull</hi> imports noe more then an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to the <hi>Catholicks</hi> to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the oppreſſions, and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Injuries, theire fellow subjects the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> did them, who had deſigned to
pull them up roote and bransh, (as was
evidently made appeare) hee alſoe praiſed
the Catholicks for indevouring to defend
<pb facs="tcp:31982:21"/>
themſelves, and theire Religion, and
gave them Indulgences in ſoe juſt and
good a quarrell; his <hi>Hollineſs</hi> ſpeaks not
a word in all againſt the King, nor obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
due to the King; <hi>Richard Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>
eſquire <hi>Agent</hi> to that <hi>Pope</hi> from the
confederate Catholicks hath ateſted,
that his <hi>Hollineſs</hi> commaunded him to
tell his Children the Catholick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats,
that hee would have them in
defending themſelves, and Religion,
to continue conſtantly obedient to
theire King, and after his <hi>Hollineſs</hi> ſent
an excellent and pious letter to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prem
Councell of the confederate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
of which I shall ſpeak more
hierafter. Will not the world rather
believe his <hi>Hollineſs</hi> owne Letters, and
the Meſſenger wee ſent him, in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his ſence in the aforſaid <hi>Bull,</hi> then
<hi>Orery</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> enemy? What I pray is
contained in that <hi>Bull,</hi> that an honeſt
man can reprehend? would <hi>Orery</hi> have
the <hi>Pope</hi> be ſoe madd, as to forbid
his Children to defend themſelves and
Religion againſt him, and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:31982:21"/>
Good God how this man doth abuſe
this <hi>Popes</hi> pious and good meaning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in foreſaid <hi>Bull,</hi> which <hi>Orery</hi>
tells the world was a Cherishing of the
Catholicks in Rebellion, as if our tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up armes for our neceſſary defence
of lives, and Religion againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
our fellow ſubjects could haue
been a rebellion, as hee would faine
perſwade his reader, and that the <hi>Popes</hi>
aforſaid <hi>Bull</hi> was a Cherishing of the
Catholicks in a Rebellion: to which
purpoſe hee ſpeaks thus. <hi>If the Popes
power over the Irish be ſoe great, theire obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the King muſt be little:</hi> as if the
Religion of the Catholicks had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency
with theire duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the King, which is moſt falſe.
The <hi>Popes</hi> power over the people is in
<hi>ſpiritualibus;</hi> the Kings power in <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus;</hi>
and thoſe powers doe wel agree
(as is evidently knowne over all the
world) in the power of Catholick
<hi>Princes</hi> over theire ſubjects, and in the
<hi>Popes</hi> power over the ſame people; thoſe
powers, and Juridictions in Catholick
<pb facs="tcp:31982:22"/>
tymes in <hi>England</hi> did not Clash, nor
doe they now in theire nature, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
people paying theire duty to
both; it is true the <hi>Luminare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
(the Pope)</hi> Catholicks venerate more,
then <hi>Luminare minus (the King)</hi> becauſe
<hi>Luminare Majus</hi> hath the greater light
and influence; yet they doe not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
omitt to pay due veneration to the
King. <hi>Orery</hi> brings noe proofe, or
ſound argument, to prove what hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
(that the <hi>Pope's Bull</hi> was ſent
for Cherishing a Rebellion,) but his
owne authority, which with us hath
little creditt, and will ſoe with any,
that shall know his ways and dealings.</p>
               <p>I pray <hi>Orery</hi> to make this reflection,
whether there have ever been in the
world more execrable and blooddy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi>
then himſelfe and Companions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who had noe dependence upon the <hi>Pope,</hi>
but quite contemned his authority, and
his perſon hated. Hee will not (I hope)
ſay the <hi>Pope</hi> Cheriſ'd theire Rebellion.</p>
               <p>The man hath much ſtrained his
brains in impugning the mentioned
<pb facs="tcp:31982:22"/>
                  <hi>Bull;</hi> and as if hee had done a great
buſſineſs, ſays thus of the Irish Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.
<hi>If they ſucceed, heaven and Ireland
is theirs; if they ſucceed not, heaven is
theirs. Orery</hi> by the quarrell, wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to hold what of <hi>Ireland</hi> was
ours, againſt invaders; who can
blame us for this? and fighting for
Religion, wee had a good claime to
heaven; and though wee ſucceeded
not in fighting, our claime to
heaven is ſtill good by our faith and
good works; this claime all our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys,
with the Proteſtant Parlaments of
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are not able to
take from us. <hi>Orery</hi> and all of his
band, and Combination hath dealt
with us as the Divill did with <hi>Iob;</hi>
the Divill touch't all that was <hi>Job's,</hi>
except his life; <hi>Orery</hi> and his people
have touched all that was ours except
our ſoules, which wee hope in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
mercy God will preſerve for his
owne Worſhip and glory, ſoe as wee have
ſtill title to ſay, <hi>heaven is ours:</hi> but hee
and his cannot ſay for themſelves, <hi>heaven
<pb facs="tcp:31982:23"/>
is ours,</hi> untill they shall change, theire
Religion into a true faith, doe good
worcks, and reſtore what they haue
uniuſtly taken from us.</p>
               <p>I will here ſett downe a few of <hi>Orerys</hi>
propoſſitions, let the reader after peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them, Iudge of them.</p>
               <p>In his auſwere to <hi>P. W.</hi> his Letter
to the Marquis of <hi>Ormond hee calls the
Irish Nation a beaſt,</hi> the Country <hi>a very
peſt-houſe, and the Religion of the
Catholicks ſomthing that pinns them upon
the ſleeve of the Pope.</hi> Was ever ſuch a
diffinition given of Religion?<note place="margin">Ad Hebr. cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Paul</hi>
defines faith thus. <hi>Eſt fides ſperendarum
ſubſtantia rerum, argumentum non appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentium.</hi>
The Apoſtle ſpeaks nothing
here of pinning, or of the <hi>Popes</hi> ſleeve.
<hi>Orery</hi> this kind of ſcoffing rallery in
holy things is ignoble, and better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Comedians then Counſellors.
Wee owe the <hi>Pope</hi> and his ſacred Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
due obedience, which wee will
with Gods bleſſing Religiously pay all
our lives, <hi>fremant, frendeant, rumpantur
invidia Oreri &amp; mille impij nugatores;</hi> and this
<pb facs="tcp:31982:23"/>
obedience did neuer take away, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
due to our King, nor ever will.
Who but a <hi>beaſt</hi> would call a noble

why came his Father thither (likely hee
hath herd, in what ſtate, and plight his

very well for many yeares in this <hi>Peſt-houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his anſwer to <hi>P. W. </hi>hee ſpeaks
theſe Godly words. <hi>Let it not ſeem ſtrange

not hee show the ſpleen, and rancor of

branch of defending the Crowne,

not accountable for what Murthers,
ſome of the common people at the firſt
riſing in the <hi>North,</hi> committed againſt
poore Proteſtants, with the taking
away of theire cattel and goods;
which wee pittied with all our harts:
the body of the Catholicks were not,
as yet com into the quarrell (but
awhile after were forced to take Arms
to avoyd theire owne Deſtruction
which could not be otherwiſe avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
and ſince taking Arms they have
done all a long what the lawes of a

your ſelfe commaunded a part of the

contained your common ſoldiers from

               </p>
               <p>I hope <hi>Orery</hi> will not ſay the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
the Irish Catholicks (ſuch hee
would haue them be) did ever revile
afflicted Majeſty in ſuch a ſcoffing way:
truly they did not, but at all tymes,
and upon all occations in theire Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitts,
theire congregrations, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
aſſemblyes they ſpake of the
King with all veneration, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
               <p>Now his Majeſty coming home in
proſperity, thoſe mockers of his Father
are all becom purify'd <hi>Muſaellmans</hi> and
ſpeake nothing but <hi>Magnalia</hi> of the
King. For all this, there are thouſands
of good true Proteſtants, Royalliſts
in <hi>England</hi> that ſtill feare, thoſe new
penitents, for abuſing Royall Autority
(or at leaſt faigne themſelves ſoe to
be) would be glad to heare once more
<pb facs="tcp:31982:26"/>
that millitary word <hi>as you were,</hi> and
if this shall com about, the King will
not have ſoe dutifull language from
them.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Orery</hi> ſays hee and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
complyed with the uſurpation
to a good end, is a ſtrange expreſſion,
hee needs explaine himſelfe. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
all the <hi>regalia,</hi> that is, they took
away the Kings <hi>Navy,</hi> Forts, Townes,
Militia, and in the end they Murther'd
the King himſelfe. Does <hi>Orery</hi> call this
a good end of complying with the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>The truth is, <hi>Orery</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in <hi>Ireland</hi> came home, when they
could noe longer ſtand of; the King
may thank Generall <hi>Muncks</hi> ingenious
ſtratagem for theire coming in, theire
intention and ways were well knowne.
Now the Kings worke being don by
<hi>Munck</hi> with all wished ſucceſs (ſoe as
thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> had noe power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it) then <hi>Orery</hi> and the reſt thought
fitt to cry out <hi>let the King live;</hi> and
as hee and his truſty comrades ſyding
<pb facs="tcp:31982:26"/>
with the uſurpation, had goverment
and places of truſt and profitt (they
then all danced to <hi>Crumwells</hi> pype) ſoe
now they court the King returning
home, <hi>and show themſelves great penitents,
taking shame to themſelves of theire guilt,
and giving Glory to God.</hi> Is not this a
great glory to God, to confeſs a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
they could noe more deny, then
wee can deny its day when the Sonne
is shining and ſcorching the earth.
That which much troubles <hi>Orery,</hi> is,
that the <hi>Irish Catholicks</hi> doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
themſelves guilty of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
with him, and give glory to
God that way, but they being, not
guilty of ſuch rebellion and treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Crowne anſwer with S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,
<hi>Praeſtat magis innocentem eſſe quam
poenitentem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orery</hi> ingag'd (as aboue was ſaid) in a
horrid rebellion, if hee could make the
Catholicks confeſs themſelves to have
been Rebells, if this hee could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
hee would indeed triumph, and
ſay in a leering way: behold the
<pb facs="tcp:31982:27"/>
                  <hi>Irish</hi> Catholicks Confeſs they have
been rebells as well as wee; but wee
have obtain'd pardon, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
them, and have gott theire eſtates
and lands to boot; let them now
walk through out the world like poor
and naked rebells.</p>
               <p>But of our ſide ſome will ſay, that
at the tyme <hi>Orery</hi> and his people had
pardon, and the Catholicks not: <hi>Non
erat Rex Iupiter omnibus idem.</hi> And that
his Majeſty's cenſure in the caſe between
us was that the Poet ſpeaks of.
<hi>Dat veniam coruis, vexai cenſura columbas.</hi>
Certainly his Majeſty, in our, and your
caſe, <hi>Orery,</hi> hath not walk't according
to <hi>Plato</hi> his excellent rule:<note place="margin">Plato legum 2. lib.</note> 
                  <hi>Non infaelix,
ſed malus ſemper caſtigandus eſt, ut fiat
melior.</hi> Not the unlucky, but the wicked
man, is allways to be Chaſtysed, that
hee may be amended. The Royall
Iudgment went quite another way, for
the unfortunate <hi>Irish Catholicks</hi> were
ſeverly punished, and the wicked <hi>Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welian</hi>
people have bin pardoned, and
rewarded with the eſtates of the <hi>Irish
<pb facs="tcp:31982:27"/>
Catholicks.</hi> Kingdoms a broad can
hardly believe matters were ſoe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed.
Likely theſe people are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
having theire harts deſire in this
world, ſoe as they may ſay without
feare <hi>Ireland is ours.</hi> But theire memory
will perish, and themſelves, or theire

men as themſelves that diſtroy'd us.

<pb facs="tcp:31982:28"/>
words of the King were not ſpoken in a

worthy to be written with a beame of the

               <p>

a ſpirituall Rebellion) then that of
Rebellion, and therfore leaves noe ſtone
unmou'd to make our warre ſuch: the

               </q>
               <p>Seing Rebells are ſoe odious and
execrable perſons, <hi>Orery</hi> is to make in
this place a dubble reflection; the firſt,
how infamous and wicked men they
have been, whoſe guilt was a confeſſed
Rebellion; ſecondly they are for ever
to praiſe the Kings Clemency, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
ſoe wicked a crime.</p>
               <p>The Iudgment of <hi>Civilians,</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
being as above ſpecifyed noe
greater injury can be done to the <hi>Irish
Catholicks,</hi> who have beene ſtill Loyall
<pb facs="tcp:31982:29"/>
to the King, then to tell the world,
theire juſt warre was a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>However it imports not much, that
our enemys call us ſoe, for an Enemys
teſtimony againſt another Enemy, is
of ſmall force: my poſſitive denyall of
what hee affirmes is a Iuſtification
good enough; if hee brings not againſt
mee, <hi>Tabulas, teſtes</hi> and great Evidences,
hee does nothing.</p>
               <p>My preſent ſubject of writing is not
to Iuſtify the <hi>Irish</hi> warre of 1641.
which, I heare, is already don by a
learned penn; yet ſomthing I will ſay
for confuting <hi>Orery's</hi> ill affected Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of us and our quarrell.</p>
               <p>That a <hi>defenfive warre</hi> can be raiſed
without the conſent and Authority of
any Prince is a Common Doctrin of
Divines, Canoniſtes, and Civilians,
and that it may ſomtymes extend it
ſelfe in effect to the nature of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
warre. This Doctrin is warranted
by the Law of Nature, (a more bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
law then are the poſſitive law's of
<pb facs="tcp:31982:29"/>
men, (which if repugne to that of
nature are noe law'<hi>s</hi>;) for by this
law, aman can defend himſelfe againſt
violence with out recurring to the
Prince. The Law of God is alſoe for
the like defence.<note place="margin">Exod. cap. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Si effringens vir do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum

reus ſanguinis. If the tbiefe be found break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the houſe or undermining, and receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a wound dye, the ſtricker shall not be
guilty of blood.</hi> By this divine precept,
as alſoe by the Law of Nature, it is
cleare and evident a private man may
kill another in defence of his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
goods.<note place="margin">S. To. 2a. 2ae. q. 6. A. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Sed multo magis</hi> (ſays S.
Thomas) <hi>Licitum eſt defendere propriam
vitam, quam propriam domum. That is to
ſay' it is much more lawfull for aman to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his life then his houſe. Ergo</hi> if aman
kills another in defence of his owne
life, hee shall not be guilty of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
which caſe is to be underſtood,
that hee intends not to kill t'other
man but in defence of his owne life;
and though ſome hould; the man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<pb facs="tcp:31982:30"/>
himſelfe may not intend the
killing of that other man, but only
the preſervation of his owne life, yet
the more Common opinion is, hee can,
and any other thing elſe that tends, to
the preſervation of his life.</p>
               <p>The ſacred Canons alſoe ſubſcribe
to this Doctrin in this Dialect.<note place="margin">De grafys ex cap. ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſti, deſce: 36. M. 35,</note>

<hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> hee is quitt, becauſe the

Legitemat ſuch an act the Princes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

               <p>It is here to be obſerued that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpable
defence hath ſoe large an
extent, that it reacheth to the defence
not only of every privat mans life, but
alſoe of his goods, Chaſtity, honour, if
ſuch things can not be otherways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.<note place="margin">In 2a. 2ae. q. 64. a 7.</note>
Soe <hi>S. Thomas.</hi> Now if ſuch
defenſe is lawfull for privat men, how
much more for a Common wealth or
Nation? <hi>Bonum enim commune excellentius,
univerſalius ac ſubendé Divinius eſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In 2a. 2ae. q. 40. a 1. dub: 2. con. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Bannez.
For that a Common good is more exellent,
more univerſal, and ſomtymes more Devine
then a private good.</hi> And if it be lawfull
to wage warre upon ſuch inferiour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
as is the preſervation, or recovery
of temporall goods, honour and the
like, how much more lawfull is it to
manage warre upon that ſupreme mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of defending, and preſeruing, the
Catholick faith, without which there
is noe Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:31982:31"/>
This was the Iudgment the pious

they undertook, and nobly perſued for
theire Religion and Laws, which they

               <p>How farre a defenſive warre may

The<hi> Irish </hi>Catholicks (ſay they) were the

of the Devines, that it is lawfull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
an Evill that can not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

anſwers that it is, in theſe caſes: firſt if

from the body of the <hi>Irish</hi> Catholicks,
and the <hi>Lord Bishop of Fernes,</hi> and <hi>Sir

did not tell thoſe <hi>Popes</hi> they came from
<pb facs="tcp:31982:34"/>
a body of Rebells, but from a people
Catholick the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
and for ſuch they were reſpected,
and viſſited by the greateſt <hi>Princes,</hi> and
<hi>Cardinalls</hi> in the <hi>Citty:</hi> and foure of the

               <p>Thus much I thought fitt to ſay by
way of digreſſion for Iuſtifying our
warr that it was noe Rebellion, and
that this Argument of <hi>Orery,</hi> the King
call'd the warr of the <hi>Irish</hi> Catholicks
a Rebellion, ergo it is a Rebellion doth
not hould;</p>
               <p>It is true, it is a received maxim,
that the King can wrong noe man.
<pb facs="tcp:31982:34"/>
The reaſon is, becauſe the King is the
Fountain of Iuſtice, and muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not to have a will to wrong or
offend any of his people. But there is
noe maxim that the King may not be
informed by Evill men or Counſells, to
the Diſtruction of his People, which
hath been often done by ſtatesmen, and
Counſellors, who ſeek after theire
owne intereſt more then the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people, which is and ought
to be the Kings principal care: in this
kinde the Lord Iuſtices in <hi>Ireland, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
and <hi>Burlaſe</hi> with a malignant part
of the Kings Counſellors in the yeare
1641. informed his Majeſty that the
Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> without diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
had entred into a Rebellion,
when only ſome diſcontented men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a Revolution in the <hi>North,</hi> and thoſe
(as was generally ſpoken) men of
ſmall eſtates, and broken fortunes, the
Lords and Gentlemen of the other
three Provinces, and all the Catholick
townes, and Corporations having not
taken arms, untill forced thereunto for
<pb facs="tcp:31982:35"/>
the neceſſary defence of theire eſtates,
and Religion, (as aboue hath been
ſaid.) I doe not heere accuſe, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the firſt ryſing in the <hi>North,</hi> but
I confidently affirme, the nobles, and
Catholick Gentlemen in the other
three Provinces (and ſome of thoſe in
the <hi>North</hi> to, that did not joyn with
the firſt Ryſing in that Province) and
all the Catholick Townes, and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
lived in ſoe happy a ſtate and
ſoe opulent and rich, that they would
neuer abett a Revolution for gaining
other mens eſtates; it is alſoe well
knowne, that all thoſe have bin ſtill
faithfull to the Crowne, and theire
Fathers before them, as was well try'd
in the warrs of Deſmon, Tyron, and
other ſmaller Revolutions. Thus it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
that his Majeſty grounded his
opinion upon the information of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>Parſons Bnrlays,</hi> and a mallignant
part of the <hi>Counſell,</hi> corrupt men, (who
after fell from the King and adhered
to the Kings Enemys, the Rebellious
Parlament.) Thoſe repreſented the
<pb facs="tcp:31982:35"/>
body of the <hi>Irish</hi> Catholick Rebells;
and the King deceived, and deluded
by this information, call'd us Rebells,
and our juſt warr a Rebellion, and to
this day wee were not heard to ſpeak
for our ſelves, and being unheard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ought to be reputed innocent. It is to
be obſerued, that the firſt flame of the
riſing in the <hi>Noth,</hi> had beene ſoon
quenched, had <hi>Parſons</hi> and thoſe of the
<hi>Councell</hi> given a Commiſſion to the
<hi>Marquis</hi> Of <hi>Ormond</hi> now <hi>Duke,</hi> to raiſe
five thouſand men, as hee demanded for
that effect, with him had gon alonge,
the Catholick Nobility and Gentlemen,
and ſoe they had made a ſpeedy work
of it: But the plott of thoſe Crooked
Miniſters of ſtate was to involue all the
Catholicks in the Buſſineſs, and there
by to finde a Cullor of confiſcating
theire eſtates.</p>

This noble man hath uſed ſtill
againſt us, his ſword and penn; but the
latter hath made the deeper wound, if
men creditt his writings: cannot hee
live contented with a good patrimony,
his Father provided for him, and agreat

upon him, at once with the place
of <hi>Lord Preſident</hi> of the faire and goodly

Theſe things I utter not by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
for wee are all the Children of

the low and ſmall neſt, in which his

not ſoe farr forgett himſelfe, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
and trample under foote a whole

thoſe that commaunded were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent;
it was then indeed men could

that there only ſmall theeves

free, and condemn'd the reſt; wee hope
it is not now ſoe in <hi>England:</hi> however
<hi>Orery</hi> for one man hath had the good
Fortune to eſcape in all tymes, and on

ſaid, that againſt a miſchief,
badd parents doe to theire Children,
there is noe other cure then patience,
but <hi>Orery</hi> being noe <hi>Parent,</hi> but an
Enemy to our Nation, is not to be
borne with, and it is more reaſonable
his owne confuſion should be his cure,
then our patience. The Catholicks of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> look upon him as a great beaſt
makeing a prey of all that's weaker,
and realy hee hath ſoe dealt with us,
<pb facs="tcp:31982:38"/>
wherfore wee may deal with him in
the ſame way according to our
ſtrength, and if hee is ſoe ſtrong and
in court ſoe much favoured as wee may
not have him cited to make anſwer, the
court will give us leave to expoſe his
vertues or vices as wee finde them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p>I will here take my leave of Count

               <q>For indeed my Lord hee appears to mee all

who ſee heaven, and all the hopes of the
other life, as Mathematitians make us behold

<pb facs="tcp:31982:39"/>
like shaddows and landſckips turned topſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turvy,
Verily, I take this Gentleman to be
abuſed ſoe by himſelfe. And that after hee
hath ſtopped up all the windows and acceſſes
to heavenly Ray's, hee hath made a little
hole for the Moone, and all the bleſſings
of the other life have ſeemed very ſlender to
his diſtruſtfull ſpiritt: and that hee hath
put on a Reſolution to make a Fortune at
what price ſoever, and to build on earth like
Caine, after hee hath allmoſt renounced the
hopes of heaven.</q>

               <q>I. A. B. doe hereby declare that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the pretended title of Charles Stuart,
and the whole line of late King Iames, and
of every other perſon pretending to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
<pb facs="tcp:31982:41"/>
of the Nations of England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

can any written wickedneſs aſcend

be greater then the pardon his
Majeſty hath granted to the men that
hartily took this oath?</p>
               <q>This Ingagment was forced upon the
Irish Catholicks in ſoe high a Nature,<note place="margin">Out of Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons Settlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sale of Ireland pag. 8.</note> that
thoſe who would not take it, were debarred
not only from the benefitt of law, but alſoe
expoſ'd to an inevitable danger of death,
the Soldiers of Crumwells Army, being
commanded by publick Proclamation, to kill
any man they met on the high-way, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
not a Certificate about him of having
taken that ingagment: Commaunds which
were Cruelly executed on ſilly Peſants, who
<pb facs="tcp:31982:42"/>
out of Ignorance, or want of care, having

               <q>It is very remarkable, <hi>(ſaith

and that thoſe, who neuer ſaw it,
before it was adminiſtrated to them, who
abbor'd it in theire harts, and were forc't to

               <p>Theſe are verities not to be doubted

<hi>(The Marquis of Ormond hauing bin your

Wee had an act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> from your

all done againſt us, is againſt

it were a greater mercy, to haſten

liberavi animam meam.</hi> Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> will
doe well to ſitt downe, and deeply
Meditate upon this weighty poynt,

               <p>Having expoſed to my Soveraigne
our calamity's, ruine and miſerys, and
offered humble prayers, for eaſe and
mercy. I now turne my ſpeech to you
my moſt deare and honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen,
for your ſake I have ſpoken
noe way minding redreſs, for what I
my ſelve have loſt, which was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>If Iuſtice shall be don you, and
cauſe of joy come from the <hi>Kings</hi> good
pleaſure and determination, prays <hi>God</hi>
and the <hi>King</hi> for that Happineſs, and
pray to <hi>God</hi> for his long and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Raigne. But if this shall not be
done <hi>(God permitting</hi> things to goe on
as they doe, either for punnishing ours,
<pb facs="tcp:31982:49"/>
and our Fathers ſinns, or for trying our
patience in this world.) Let his holy
Name be ever bleſſed: beare patiently
your poverty, and you shall finde po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
a great bleſſing, <hi>S. Iohn Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
compares it with Martyrdome.
<hi>Egeſtas</hi> (ſaith the Saint) <hi>bene tollerata
facit Martirium.</hi> I doe not think there
can hardly be any found in the world,
that have come to a greater diſtreſs, and
poverty, then that you endure, ſuffer
all willingly for <hi>God's ſake</hi> and you are
ſure of a <hi>Crowne:</hi> minde often that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſentence of S. <hi>Auguſtin. Saeculi
homines, infaeliciter faelices ſunt, Martyres
autem faeliciter infaelices erat. The men of
this world, are unhappily happy, but the
Martyrs have been happily unhappy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is your caſe, or very like it,
ſoe as in your nakedneſs, your are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
then thoſe that have all that was
yours, living in pleaſurs, and plenty,
Let this alſoe be ſome comfort to you,
that you have but loſt, thoſe things you
could not long hould, nor shall the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
poſſeſſors long enjoy them.
<pb facs="tcp:31982:50"/>
Though they think theire fortuns in
that <hi>Land</hi> ſurely ſettled, they are but
Pilgrims in the way as you are, and
muſt part as you shall (and with
more greef, and feare, for having
more then you have) and then they
shall know and feel Gods Iudgment
for what they have done to you.</p>
               <p>In all your afflictions, I shall pray
and conjure you, to demean your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
like good Chriſtians, paying
faithfully to <hi>God</hi> his due, and to the
<hi>King</hi> his; to the <hi>King</hi> Fidelity and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
in <hi>Civilibus,</hi> and that for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſake; to <hi>God</hi> Veneration and
higheſt Worship, which can not be
performed without profeſſing a true
<hi>Rcligion,</hi> the ſame you are of: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let noe wordly preferments, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity's,
that men can conferr on you;
nor punishments they can inflict, shake
your <hi>Religion,</hi> but hould the ſame
conſtantly in all tempeſts and ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
for of it depends eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeak at the preſent tyme
<pb facs="tcp:31982:50"/>
of your great afflictions, imitate I
pray you, the three <hi>Iſralites</hi> caſt into
the furnaſe of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and you shall
finde, as they did, an Angell to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you. They in the fyre bleſſed the
name of <hi>God,</hi> when <hi>Azarias</hi> ſtanding in

               <q>Bleſſed art thou O Lord, the God of

art juſt in all things which thou haſt

and thy ways righteous, and thy Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
