            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS Upon a late LIBEL, called A Letter from a Perſon of Quality to his Friend, concerning the Kings Declaration, &amp;c</head>
            <p>WE live in an Age where ill humor and Malice to the Government do ſo prevail, that men rail without any manner of diſtinction, and without examining what things are good or bad in themſelves; there ſeemeth to be no other Rule allowed by one ſort of Men, than that they cannot Err, and the King cannot be in the Right: This general Maxim is ſo eaſie, by taking the trouble of any further enquiry, that no wonder if it is cheriſhed and entertained; and thoſe who are ſo prepoſſeſſed, are ready to turn the beſt things to a wrong ſenſe, and to receive ſuch an interpretation of every thing that comes from the Court, as their Miſleaders are pleaſed to impoſe upon them.</p>
            <p>The Wiſer ſort of them knowing nothing is ſo deſtructive to their ends, as that the Government ſhould take ſuch meaſures as might ſilence their Objections, have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to blaſt every thing that is done on that ſide, and to disfigure with the colours they put upon them, all ſuch things as might undeceive the People, and reconcile them to the Crown; for at the ſame time they appear ſo eager to have Grievances redreſſed, their more ſecret Prayers are that they may be increaſed: If the Court maketh any falſe ſteps, or giveth any provocation, it raiſeth Noiſe and Clamour, the voice againſt it is loud; but the killing grief that afflicteth them inwardly, and galleth them to the ſoul, is, when the King doth a gracious or a plauſible Act to the Publick.</p>
            <p>Of this there cannot be a greater inſtance than their being ſo afflicted at the Kings late Declaration: It was an evidence of their grief, that it was ſo long before they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it: It was received with a ſilent indignation that the Court ſhould preſume to out-argue them; and though they had rage enough to rail, yet they were for ſome time reſtrained from their uſual Dialect by the reverence that is due to Reaſon, even when it is contrary to our Paſſions or Intereſts.</p>
            <p>At laſt when they ſaw the effect it had in the Nation, and being not without reaſon apprehenſive, that mens eyes might be ſo opened as to ſee them through their popular Diſguiſe, they thought of two ills, it was adviſable to chuſe the leaſt; and rather than lie under the general reproach of having nothing to ſay, they choſe to venture a Reply, though they could not make a good one, preſuming upon the ſucceſs they had met with in their impoſing upon the world, and believing it would be ſo favourably diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on their ſide, that where their falſe Arguments could not paſs, they would at leaſt be connived at.</p>
            <p>This being after more than one Meeting reſolved at a Conſult, out cometh a Letter to a Friend, which of late ſignifieth little leſs than a Proclamation ſet out by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the high and mighty Conſervators of <hi>England,</hi> there is only this difference which is for their advantage, that if theſe Letters take in the world, they are imputed to the wiſdom of theſe great Governors; if not, they are eaſily laid upon ſome fooliſh
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65660:2"/>
fellow that would be ſcribling; by which means the veneration due to theſe Princes of the People remains unblemiſhed and entire.</p>
            <p>This coming with other Pamphlets to me in the Country, I was tempted to make ſome ſhort Obſervations which are ſubmitted to the cenſure of the unbyaſſed Reader. Firſt they are troubled, that though Parliaments are frequent, they are ſhort and uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>The King hath done his part in calling Parliaments often, for which he is to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; except it can be made evident it was his fault that they were of no longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: ſo far from that, it is plain theſe men who complain have been ſo much the cauſe of the late Diſſolutions, that one would ſwear they deſigned to provoke the King to them, and that he hath had in theſe caſes ſo much patience, he can hardly anſwer it to the Nation, whoſe peace he is entruſted with and bound to preſerve.</p>
            <p>The Exceſſes of the Commons were beyond the cure of lower Remedies, and there was no other choice left, than either to part with the Parliament, or let the two Houſes continue fitting in a ſtate of Hoſtility hardly poſſible to be reconciled; of which the conſequences are ſo obvious, and might have been ſo fatal, that we are to thank God the Conſtitution of the Government hath lodged this neceſſary Power in the Crown to preſerve us from Ruine upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>But fain they would have Parliaments ſit as long as they pleaſe, and I cannot blame them, Authority is ſweet, and a Member of Parliament that would have us believe he bringeth all the ſenſe of his Country or Corporation along with him, cometh to teach the King better manners, and to adviſe him to keep better company. I ſay for ſuch a dignified Creature as this is, by one word of the Kings mouth to be reduced into his own ſingle ſelf again, is ſo cruel a charge, that no wonder if men ſo degraded are angry at it, and would be glad, inſtead of being as little men as their Neighbors, to gain that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority which Nature denied them, by virtue of an Authority to continue for their lives.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth then by this, that a long Parliament is not in it ſelf a Grievance, for now they would have one that they think their Party ſhall prevail in it.</p>
            <p>And it is obſervable that thoſe who were for the firſt Long Parliament, and againſt the ſecond, are now the chief men that would have a third: How far this ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the opinion either to the King or the Nation, I leave every man to judge; but to do theſe men right, they are for the preſent ſo modeſt they will not ſpeak out, ſo I will do it for them.</p>
            <p>The little thing they would have is a Houſe of Commons that may do what they will, how they will, and as long as they will, that is for ever, whether the King liveth or dieth, they muſt not be diſcompoſed, nor their Authority interrupted, for I would fain know where lieth the real difference between having a Parliament ſit for ever, or till all Grievances are redreſſed: the diſtinction will be very nice in an Age where it is Treaſon againſt the People not to grumble againſt the Government. Theſe rich Mines of Fears and Jealouſies can never be exhauſted in our time, ſo that the Workmen are ſure not only to be employed for their lives, but to ſecure their Poſterities being ſo after them.</p>
            <p>The Monarchy in the mean time would be in a good caſe to be under the continual Wardſhip of ſuch ſevere Guardians; and theſe very Gentlemen who have upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other occaſion affirmed that the very name of King muſt of neceſſity carry the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty along with it, would not fail to give a full inſtance to the contrary, if they could ever catch our Maſter in the Net of a Perpetual Parliament.</p>
            <p>They are troubled that the Declaration ſhould be read in Churches, from which this Obſervation naturally ariſeth, that they apprehend the making it ſo publick, may both expoſe them, and do the King right to the People; elſe ſure they would not of a ſuddain be ſo well natured, as to diſcourage the reading it, if they had thought the weakneſs of the Argument might have brought any diſadvantage upon the King.</p>
            <p>This Paper hath laid down Maxims that are very new in our Conſtitution, <hi>The King can make no ill Orders becauſe they muſt be by advice of his Council.</hi> This is a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Monarchy put ſo much into the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſhape, that a man would have much ado to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
            <p>It will be granted that the King is to hear the Advice of his Council, but for him to be bound by it, would make that greater than the Parliament; where if the King hath right to refuſe any Bill that is offered, ſure he may in Council reject any Opinion. I am confident it is not their meaning to attribute ſuch an Authority to the preſent Council; I am perſuaded it is far from their thoughts to wiſh the King ſhould be ſwayed by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65660:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of men who are ſo little in their favour, and eſpecially ſince it wanteth the help of thoſe whoſe abilities and other Vertues in their opinion did formerly ſupport it. This Complement muſt therefore be intended for another Council, a confiding Council that is to be made up with the reſt of the New Model, we may ſuppoſe is prepared againſt the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> is paſs'd, and then they do not care how much power they give to themſelves, or take away from the King.</p>
            <p>To excuſe the not giving Money for <hi>Tangier,</hi> they pretend they could not be ſecure of its being diſpoſed to that uſe. It is hard they ſhould expect the world ſhould believe them in this, when it is certain they do not believe themſelves. The experience we have had in our own time may ſufficiently convince them of the injuſtice of that Objection; and to ſay Paper Laws are nothing, is to ſay our Liberties and Properties are nothing, ſince we hold them chiefly by that tenure: But the truth is theſe men would impoſe upon us, that an Act of Parliament will ſecure nothing they do not like, and do every thing they have a mind to: For inſtance, <hi>An Act for excluding the Duke is all-ſufficient. An Act for limiting him Impoſſible. An Act of Excluſion will ſecure all. All other Laws are but Cobwebs not to be relied upon.</hi> Theſe Riddles are delivered to us with ſuch authority, that we are to receive them as Oracles, and it is become a mortal ſin for any man to queſtion the ſenſe of them.</p>
            <p>This ſlender way of reaſoning being ſo openly liable to confutation, and the diſguiſe ſo thin that every body muſt ſee through it, they have recourſe to that common place, the <hi>PLOT,</hi> for a Buttereſs and a ſupport to Arguments that are too weak to bear up themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is a retreat when they are beaten in Diſpute, an anſwer to any queſtion at a pinch; it is but ſaying there is a horrid Plot againſt our Religion, the Kings Life is in danger, the Pilgrims are coming from St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> is to be murthered, and the Popular Champion triumpheth without the help of Senſe, againſt his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That there hath been a Plot, is as certain, as that the men who moſt exclaim againſt it are of all men living the moſt unwilling to part with it: they cheriſh and nurſe it up with more care than the Jeſuites themſelves; they hug it ſo faſt, that it ſheweth how much they value it, as the dear inſtrument they make uſe of to deſtroy the Government. The Day of Judgment would not be much more terrible to ſome men, how little ſoever they are prepared for it, than that day which ſhould wind up the bottom of this beloved Plot, that men might come into their wits again. Ungrateful men then, that ſpeak ill of the only thing in this world that ſupporteth them: But the good men in their hearts are far from meaning it any harm. Were the Plot once over, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> would be quite degraded, loſe his reſpect at <hi>Wapping,</hi> and his authority in the Coffee-Houſes. His Lordſhip would put off his diſſembling-ſhape, and in this be a true mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for never man could have a greater loſs, and no doubt it would out of grief make him retire into ſome hidden corner, rather than ſee himſelf reduced to the miſerable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being quiet for want of ſufficient matter to trouble himſelf and the world with; ſo that when theſe men pretend to deſire an end of the Plot, it is a Jeſt fitter for a Smile than an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was a Rogue, granted, and yet as I hear, this Rogue was brought into both Houſes juſt before the Debate, to whip them up into the <hi>Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> but now they tell a very ſtrange thing, which is, that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is become truly honeſt. It is much, and in my opinion, it is a viſible but the Knave. That this man ſhould be made honeſt would be a mighty Cure, And ſuch a one as ſome of his Doctors would be loth to work upon themſelves. In the mean time I cannot but put them in mind that it looketh a little Popiſh, not only to give a general Indulgence to ſuch a known ſinner, but immediately to make a Saint of him. If the Gathered Churches can do ſuch Miracles, it is well, but if they ſhould endeavour to put falſe ones upon the world, it might diſparage their prudence, and leſſen their reputation; of which I am ſo tender, that in kindneſs to them I give them this warning of it.</p>
            <p>It is true that in ſome reſpects the Maxim is not inconvenient for theſe good men, <hi>That there can be neither Fools nor Raſcals on their ſide, and that the being of their opinion, like the Crown, taketh away all Defects:</hi> By virtue of this charm Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> is a Divine, Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> a Proteſtant, Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> a Saint, Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> a Patriot, and Sir <hi>Harry Capel</hi> a Stateſman.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of the fears the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> hath for himſelf, and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65660:3"/>
good nature would be glad to eaſe him of them; in order to it, I beg of him to believe the Papiſts are as tender of his life, as his Lordſhip is of the Plot: and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe he is of uſe to them, he hath abſolutely ſaved them by ſpoiling a good Plot, and dreſſing it ſo ſcurvily by the help of his under-Cook, that now it maketh even the beſt mens ſtomachs riſe at it. He ſerveth up things ſo much above the ſtrongeſt digeſtion, that few men can be perſuaded to ſwallow them. So that a man may affirm, that if it was a folly in the Papiſts to kill Sir <hi>Edmond Godfrey,</hi> it would be a madneſs in them to hurt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen are angry with the Guards which are ſo illegally kept up. Pray ſince when are they judged ſo? is it only ſince the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was put away from them? ſtrange! that ſince that time there muſt be ſuch a change, that he muſt be made lawful, and they illegal. It muſt be confeſſed, that next to the Laws, the Guards are the things of the world theſe men moſt hate: Fie upon them naughty fellows, rhey ſtand between them and home. The good men would fain have a ſafe victory, and do their buſineſs without venturing their skulls. For would it not be a cruel thing for an honeſt well-meaning Mutineer for his Zeal to deſtroy the Government, whilſt he is about it, to have his brains knockt out, and ſo loſe the benefit of ſpoiling the Aegyptians. Verily it is much better to have the Guards down, that he may walk into <hi>Whitehal</hi> with leſs peril of his perſon, and help to remove the Dukes Creatures out of all places Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and Civil.</p>
            <p>For be it known to all men by theſe preſents, that the Duke is more dangerous to us as he is the Great Miniſter of State, than as he is the next Succeſſor. Say you ſo, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, men gueſſed before this was your meaning; but I am ſorry for your ſakes you are ſo unwary as to diſcover it: Why ſuch earneſtneſs to remove the Succeſſor, when the danger is confeſſed to be greater from the Miniſter? Come, ſpeak out, the Poſition is, The Duke governeth all; conſequently every man in employment is his Creature, for that they are to be turned out, and theſe Gentlemen taken in: the deſign is well enough laid, and would do them more good than the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> which is but a pretence, and a thing fitted for other ends: But they did not do well to blab this out before it was time, it is a thouſand pities the Scheme ſhould not take, but I very much doubt it as things now ſtand, which is to be lamented, that the good men ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much pains, and all likely to be to ſo little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After having arraigned the Declaration, they come to juſtifie the proceedings of the Commons in the two laſt Meetings, and ſpeaking of ſome of their Addreſſes, ſay, <hi>The nature, and true ſtate of Affairs would not bear a milder way of repreſenting things to his Majeſty.</hi> Let them ſpeak truth, was it not rather the nature of thoſe men, whoſe pride and anger made them delight in handling the King roughly, and perſuade the Houſe, when they were asked what ſhould be done with <hi>Tangier,</hi> to anſwer with Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and a Remonſtrance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I admire the caution of thoſe <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good Men,</hi> who as the Paper ſaith, <hi>thought the Commons had gone too far, inſomuch as mentioning Money till our ſafety was fully provided for.</hi> They muſt be very jealous that could ſuſpect any ſuch danger; for beſides that we are very ſafe in the management of thoſe that led the Houſe, who no doubt will ever have a moſt particular care of us in theſe caſes; one may aſſure the <hi>Wiſe and Good Men</hi> of a further and better ſecurity, which is, that the Government is not yet ſo low as to ſell it ſelf ſo cheap. As for what the Commons propoſed, when-ever they have a mind to deal, it is to be hoped they will offer ſome more equal Bargain, than to demand from the King the whole power of the Crown both Civil and Military, and to propoſe from themſelves things ſo general, and ſo low, that the Supreme Wiſdom of the Nation could hardly be thought in earneſt when they offered them.</p>
            <p>It is added for a further excuſe that jealouſies eaſily ariſe amongſt Numbers, which is enough to hinder any intended Agreement. The anſwer to this is, that it is true, there did ariſe ſome jealouſies, that the Promoters of an Agreement with the King did not forget themſelves in it; but the Gentlemen who were concerned being ſenſible of it, did for their Vindication procure a ſolemn Vote, That no Member of the Houſe ſhould receive any place from the King <hi>without the leave of the Houſe,</hi> which was ſo perfect a cure for jealouſie, that they are unjuſt to be againſt all expedients, after this had been ſo proſperous. I am half in a rapture, when I think of this glorious Vote, worthy to be written in Letters of Gold, and impoſſible ever to be enough commended: By the firſt part of it they ſhewed their ſelf-denial, and by their ſecond their deference to a Houſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65660:3"/>
they thought at leaſt they governed. Great men ſure they muſt be, and bleſſed with ſo happy genius, that could ſo mingle their Diſcretion with their Generoſity, as at once to gain honor, and provide for their intereſt. The anſwer to the Kings Charge upon them for their Arbitrary Orders, is ſo weak and faint, that it cometh very near a confeſſion of their guilt in it, and it would be unkind to preſs them too hard in that which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeem to be aſhamed of. I will only take notice of one expreſſion, which is, <hi>That they have erred with their Fathers.</hi> If this is not true, it is no good Argument: and if it is true, they muſt allow it to be as good a one for the Papiſts, as it is for the Commons.</p>
            <p>They come next to ſupport their Votes againſt particular perſons, and do very boldly aſſert it may be made good by Law, <hi>The King ought to have no perſon near him who hath the misfortune of ſuch a Vote upon him.</hi> Great Lawyers no doubt have their part in this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but they who in ſo many caſes diſpute the Authority of the Crown, muſt allow men in this to demur to theirs; and I am troubled that a Vote of the Commons muſt be called a Misfortune; becauſe it looketh as if chance or ſudden heat, rather than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Debates and Juſtice of the Houſe had produced it. Where there is a ſetled Rule, and that Right only prevaileth, as mens guilt maketh them fall, ſo their innocence ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth them. But if men muſt depend upon their good or ill Stars, or upon the waſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh humor of an Aſſembly when an angry Planet reigneth, the conſequence is, that a man though never ſo faultleſs may by misfortune without guilt be transformed by a Vote, into an enemy of King and Kingdom; that is to ſay, into a man fit to be knocked on the head, and the Murtherer to be rewarded as the Law formerly directed for killing a Wolf; and yet God forbid one ſhould think the Commons intended him any harm.</p>
            <p>Well, but if the Houſe declareth they have juſt reaſon to fear ſuch or ſuch a perſon dangerous, muſt there be Order and Proceſs of Law before he can be removed?</p>
            <p>When the Commons have juſt reaſon to fear ſuch a thing, it is to be hoped the whole Houſe knoweth that juſt reaſon, or elſe they would not Vote it: when-ever therefore they will tell that juſt reaſon to the King, he is to blame in caſe he findeth it ſo, if he doth not comply with them; but if he judge otherwiſe, he hath as much right to refuſe, as they can pretend to have to ask. But if it muſt be ſo, that not only the real, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended fears of ſome angry men, who may have influence enough to miſlead an Aſſembly not ſufficiently informed, are to have ſuch an Authority, that the Kings Negative to them is diſallowed, it is ſuch a change of the Conſtitution, that the Legiſlative Power is wholly melted down into one of the parts that hath yet no power to do any Act that is binding without the concurrence of the Lords, and the Kings Royal Aſſent.</p>
            <p>This doth ſo much out-go even our modern <hi>Plato,</hi> that it will be a harder matter than perhaps theſe Gentlemen think, to get either the King or the Nation to conſent to it. Men are not ſo well edified with the practice of the Commons in this laſt Age, or the juſtice that hath been uſually diſtributed by their Sovereign Committees, as to devolve the whole power into their hands, thinking it much better lodged where it is by the preſent Conſtitution. But it is ſaid the Commons by their late Methods do not fine men, nor deprive them of Life, Liberty, Lands or Offices beneficial. I would firſt ask, is it not a Fine, and to many men the worſt kind of Fine, to be excluded from the lawful advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges every Subject is born to. Would not a Merchant think it a Fine, if he were ſentenced never to go to Sea again? Or to come nearer, Would not theſe very men of Law who will have this paſs upon us, take it unkindly, and think it a Fine, if they were excluded from all Practice? 'Tis true, if they would always argue for their Clients; as they do now for the Commons, their loſs perhaps might not be very great; but preſuming better things of them, I conclude the ſentence would be very heavy, and that they would think it ſo.</p>
            <p>Concerning Life, if the definition of an enemy to King and Kingdom is a certain crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is not fit to live, then the Commons have done all they can to take away the lives of thoſe they have ſo ſentenced, except they had ſent a ſelect Committe to ſtrangle them, which had not been ſo convenient till the Laws are removed, which would have made it Murther; ſo that they muſt either ſay that a man who doth what lieth in him to kill me, meaneth no hurt to my life, which is but indifferent ſenſe; or they muſt confeſs there was plain Murther in the intention of thoſe Votes.</p>
            <p>For to borrow their own ſtile, it may be reſolved by the authority of impartial reaſon, that whoſoever Voted any of thoſe perſons enemies to King and Kingdom with any other intent than that the ſaid Perſons ſhould be abſolutely deſtroyed, is a Mad-man, an Ideot, a Promoter of Lunacy, and an enemy to Common Senſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65660:4"/>Then for Liberty, ſee whether that is touched or no. If Liberty ſignifieth a power of doing every lawful act, and that it is a lawful act for every Subject to have acceſs to his Prince, then without ſome act committed to forfeit that common right, it is a wrong in any one man, or any number of men to Addreſs to the King for the incapacitating any one man in this caſe. Sure men will not ſay our Liberty is not invaded except we are thrown neck and heels into a Dungeon. It is a tenderer thing than that cometh to, and it hath been formerly judged even by a Houſe of Commons, that mens being ſent away againſt their wills upon Forein Employment, was a Confinement. By this it may appear that it is poſſible to make an unjuſt Demand as well as to give an unjuſt Sentence: And though the King hath power to refuſe any thing that is asked of him, whatever ſome men would perſuade us to the contrary, yet that doth neither abſolve the Commons, nor any other man from the guilt of making a requeſt that is not juſt, nor from the folly of making one that is not pertinent.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee now whether even mens Lands would not have been reached by theſe Votes, if theſe good Gentlemen might have had their will; for by the ſame rule that a true Proteſtant Jury muſt have been directed by them not to find it Murther in any man to kill an enemy to King and Kingdom, they muſt upon any diſpute of title of Land, give it without going from the Bar againſt any man ſo branded and proclaimed. Sure a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> at a time when they are in open War with us, would hardly hope to carry a cauſe againſt an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>; no more is a man to pretend, whilſt under a Character that putteth him into a ſtate of Hoſtility with <hi>England,</hi> to keep up a ſuit againſt a Neighhor, or expect the benefit of the Law, which is to give no protection to publick Enemies.</p>
            <p>As to Offices beneficial, it muſt be confeſſed they ſhew ſome gentleneſs at laſt, and give ſo much indulgence to thoſe they have diſplaced by their Votes, that I do not ſee but any of them may upon due application, and expreſſive and fit remorſe for the inſolence of reſiſting their high and mighty pleaſure, be admitted to be a Conſtable or Headborough in <hi>Wales</hi> or <hi>Cumberland,</hi> or ſome ſuch unexpected Office in which <hi>the Publick State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are not immediately concerned,</hi> where they may exerciſe their Magiſtracy, and enjoy their dignity without prejudice to the Nation.</p>
            <p>This Grace ſeemeth the fitter to be acknowledged, not only becauſe it is perhaps the firſt evidence that party hath given of their good nature, but becauſe they do in this deal more gently with thoſe againſt whom they have Voted, than they do with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty himſelf as well as they love him; for by what I can perceive, the King is only to eat and drink, and perform ſome offices of nature. They are kind men; but it was not arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially done to leave it out, that <hi>A King is to have ſome Pocket-money for play things,</hi> ſince it is but reaſonable for them to uſe a thing kindly, which if they can have in their power, they intend to make ſo good uſe of.</p>
            <p>That wiſe and great Princes have ſometimes hearkened to Addreſſes of this kind, is not truer, than that they have oftner denied them: for the King to do in all caſes like a wiſe and a great Prince, as it is a general propoſition, all who do not know him have reaſon to wiſh it, and all who do have very good grounds to hope it. But as far as one ſort of men may be concerned in their own particulars, I gueſs wrong, if it would not be too fatal a thing to them ever to joyn in Prayer for it.</p>
            <p>The Votes to forbid men to lend the King money, are to theſe mens thinking not only juſtifiable, but very wiſe ones too. Theſe are Epithetes which it ſeemeth belong to every thing they do, or elſe I would ask where is the Juſtice of doing that for which they have no authority, or the Wiſdom of doing that which hath no effect; only it ſheweth their good will, by throwing the greateſt indignity they could upon the Government. Men will lend ſtill notwithſtanding this mighty Vote, and perhaps upon eaſier terms than theſe Gentlemen would require for any money they part with in Parliament. In the mean time would theſe equitable men take it well, if by their example the King ſhould ſend to all the Burroughs and Counties in <hi>England</hi> not to chuſe ſuch and ſuch men, nor to truſt thoſe with a ſhare in making Laws, who have in the late Parliaments aſſumed to themſelves the priviledge of breaking them? The argument is at leaſt as ſtrong on the Kings ſide, without any Complement to Majeſty, as they can pretend to make theirs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pretence of diſtruſt, or the miſ-application of the Publick Money: and yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelf, they would hardly allow ſuch a proceeding, or commend it, as they do their own, to be wiſe and juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65660:4"/>They take ſo much care of the Houſhold, that one would ordinarily ſuſpect they had ſome Correſpondence with the diſcontented Reformadoes of the <hi>Green-Cloth.</hi> I who live in the Country will never ſpeak againſt the ſmell of Beef, no more than I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that of Match to be at <hi>White-Hall</hi> inſtead of it: But I am far from apprehending the Country Farmer to be concerned in the late Retrenchments; for ever ſince the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were removed out of the Hall, and the Brewis turned into Fricaſſees, they have loſt their part in them, and eſpecially ſince the Kings coming in, not only the Country Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but the Country Gentleman; and if you will the Country Lord too might have been ſhrewdly diſappointed if they had depended upon the Hoſpitality of the White-Staves for a Dinner: That whole buſineſs was brought into ſo unpopular a ſhape, that the Nation will hardly take up Arms to reſtore three or four Tables; they are rather pleaſed to ſee them put down, ſince they were ſo transformed, and wholly altered from their firſt inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Bankers are called the Bane of the Nation; if ſo, I have a great mind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if it was poſſible, it was for that reaſon alone, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> broke them. I never was partial to that ſort of men, and ſo will leave them to make their own Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: but I muſt ſay, it ſeemeth a little hard to me to make theſe Poſitions, <hi>The Bankers nor any body elſe muſt lend the King Money. The Kings Wants are only to be ſupplied by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Parliament is not to give the King a farthing.</hi> Theſe laid together, have in my judgment a very odd appearance: <hi>Ay, but the King ſhall have money enough upon good terms from the Parliament:</hi> Shall he ſo? Theſe good terms are to come; for thoſe that have hitherto been offered are ſo far from tempting, that they may rather fright the King from dealing with the ſame Chapmen. Would theſe Gentlemen grow a little kinder and treat for a Mortgage of the Crown, allowing equity of Redemption, it might incline the King to hearken to them; but by all that appeareth yet, we may conclude nothing leſs will ſatisfie than a total ſurrender and paſſing away his title to them.</p>
            <p>In the caſe of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it is pretended the Commons did not aſſume the power of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending Acts of Parliament: what was it then? They did a thing they had a mind to in a manner they cannot juſtifie; they have as much right to make a Law, as they have ſingly to declare what is Law: but becauſe they ſeem to give up the cauſe by the flatneſs of their anſwer, I will only add, that as their zeal in this caſe tranſported them beyond their bounds, it is to be hoped, time and ſecond thoughts will reduce them to a better temper againſt the next Meeting.</p>
            <p>In Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi>'s Caſe it is ſaid the Commons could not come to a Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to a Reſolution: ſuppoſe it, what then? muſt that Reſolution of neceſſity produce ſuch Votes? If they had upon a cool Debate reſolved that they were in the right, and ſent to confer with the Lords either to have brought them to their opinion, or laid it aſide if the Lords could have uſed arguments ſtrong enough to convince them, they had prevented all objection. But to ſay the Commons could not reſolve this amongſt themſelves without ſuch injurious and unparliamentary terms as they were pleaſed to make uſe of in their Votes, is to ſay, if I have a difference with another man, and would diſcourſe with him to compoſe it, I muſt needs for the better aſſerting my own right, ſend him word beforehand, he is a Rogue and a Villain, as a fitting Preliminary for a friendly Conference in order to an Agreement. For their Votes upon this occaſion have, as much as in them lay, put the Houſe of Lords under an Interdict, and fixed ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon their whole Body, that if it were not a little ſanctified by that choſen Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Proteſting Lords, I do not know but it might bear an Action, to be called by the Scandalous name of a Peer, after a Sentence that putteth all the Lords in as ill a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as thoſe few that in the former Parliament they beſtowed their Votes upon. How much ſoever theſe Gentlemen may flatter themſelves in this matter, I can aſſure them, we in the Country underſtand it otherwiſe than they would have us: for by the infinite heat and ſtrugling to put off his Tryal both in and ſince the Parliament, and by the Character of the Perſons who principally appear in it, we are apt to conclude ſo warm a Contention muſt be grounded upon ſomething very conſiderable; and we take it to be, that could this point be gained, men might either ſpeak or act Treaſon with impunity; and that would be of ſuch excellent uſe to ſome men, that no wonder if they are very earneſt to compaſs it.</p>
            <p>I am very glad to hear there is nothing to be ſaid for thoſe angry Men who have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſigns; if any thing could have been ſaid, I am confident it might concern ſome of thoſe who have had a hand in this Paper, ſo far as to have perſuaded them to venture at their Apology.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65660:5"/>There is an Aſſertion made with the modeſty and truth which belongeth to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz. That all who are out of their places might have kept them.</hi> If I am either rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or may be allowed to gueſs from what they deſerved, it is perhaps the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe men have for their ill manners, that from the proſpect they had of being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, they choſe to prevent the Kings Juſtice, and to gain popularity, by endeavouring as much as in them lay to throw the affront upon him.</p>
            <p>The Court hath long lain under the ſcandal of Popery, but it was news to me that they were for a Common-wealth too: This is ſo very unlikely, that for the ſake of our Religion which dependeth ſo much upon their credit, I muſt give them warning to be a little more cautious in their Accuſations, and take care that one part of their charge may agree with another; elſe as it happeneth to their <hi>Mufti</hi> Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> men will be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by their alledging things impoſſible, to have doubts even of that part of their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which may be true.</p>
            <p>The laſt Paragraph telleth us <hi>how we ſhall be happy, and the King be himſelf.</hi> I was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to know this receipt, having a great mind for my own ſake, and for every bodies elſe, to have ſuch a thing compaſſed; but by taking the ſenſe of the words as well as I can, it is no more than this in ſhort: All will be well if the King will be entirely governed by the Houſe of Commons; for we know they alone ſignifie the Parliament, as they have more than once given us to underſtand by their Votes: and that their Advices are to be Commands, is no more a doubt, than that their Orders are to be Laws. I ſhall give no anſwer to this, but may be permitted to gueſs the Kings will be <hi>le Roy s'aviſera.</hi> In the mean time I have ſo great a deſire to be happy my ſelf, and that the Nation may be ſo too, that if any thing may be received under the unwelcome name of Expedients, I would beg leave to offer a few to their better conſideration.</p>
