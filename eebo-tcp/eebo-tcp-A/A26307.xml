         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And Sir, the Experiments of Healing by <hi>Transfuſion of

may caſt ſome Radiatiations of light upon the obſcure and
devious paces of Nature, ſuch as may perhaps diſcover ſome
of her more hidden receſſes, eſpecially in her regiment of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies. I have (as far as was poſſible) avoided hard
and obſcure words, but having taken upon me to inquire into
the reaſons, and examine the admirable ſucceſs of theſe late
Experiments, by the Teſt of Hermetick Phyloſophy, it was not
poſſible for me to avoid ſuch Terms as this Art neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
to render it intelligible; though (if I miſtake not) this
method gratifies the underſtanding with far more evident and
apparent reaſon than that of the Peripateticks, commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

Majeſtie into a good opinion of the noble Science of Chymiſtry,
which ſolely poſſeſſes all the keyes of the three Kingdomes
of Nature, the natural propenſity of Your Royal Genius, ſtrongly
<pb facs="tcp:56531:3"/>
inclines You to the love of all Learning, but more particularly
of this, the most worthy perhaps of all humane Sciences, ſuch as
that antiently amongſt the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Arabians,</hi>

&amp;c. and although the ignorance and Thraſonick boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Pſeudochymiſts, have almoſt brought it into contempt in
this Age, yet it is a moſt undoubted truth, That <hi>Paracelſus,
Van Helmont,</hi> and many others, have been able to conquer all
Diſeaſes Gallenical Phyſitians now call incurable, and that
with great facility; in effect, true Philoſophers have not only

UPON A
LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which I find moſt remarkable in Mr. <hi>Denis</hi>'s
Letter, is firſt, the Transfuſion of the Blood of a
Mangie Dog into a Sound one, to try whether
the Mange would be communicated with the
blood; the Mangie Dog is found cur'd; and
the other who had received his blood, not become Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</p>
            <p>The next is the Experiment upon a Youth, who had for the
ſpace of above two Months, been tormented with a contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and violent Fever, which (ſaies the Narrative) oblig'd
his Phyſitians to bleed him twenty times, in order to aſſuage
the exceſſive heat. Before this Diſeaſe he was not obſerved to
be of a lumpiſh dull Spirit, his Memory was happy enough, and
he ſeem'd cheerful and nimble enough of body: but ſince the
violence of this Fever, his Wit ſeem'd wholly ſunk, his Memory
perfectly loſt, and his body ſo heavy and drowſie, that he was
not fit for any thing: to trouble you no longer with every
particular of the relation; They opened his vein, and took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three ounces of blood, ſo black and thick, it could hardly
form it ſelf into a threed to fall into the Porrenger: At the
ſame time they brought a Lamb, whoſe <hi>Carotis</hi> Artery was
prepar'd, out of which, they emitted into the Young mans
vein about three times as much of its <hi>Arterial</hi> blood, as he had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56531:5"/>
emitted into the diſh, and ſo ſtop't the Orifice of the vein as
uſually in other Phlebotomies; being ask'd how he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſaid during the operation, he felt a very great heat all
along his Arme, but in brief, he preſently became more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and lively, eat his meat very well, and ſhew'd a cleer and
ſmiling Countenance; the next day ſlept better, and from that
time got the victory over his drowſineſs, he had no longer
ſlowneſs of Spirit, nor heavineſs of Body, grew fat viſibly,
and is (ſaies Mr. <hi>Denis)</hi> a ſubject of amazement to all that know
him.</p>
            <p>Though Mr. <hi>Denis</hi> hath ſufficiently anſwered the weak ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
aagainſt the Practice of this new Art, yet, how the
ſound infus'd blood of one Animal, mingling with the infected
Maſs of another (and eſpecially, of a different Species,) indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
renovation and health into the diſeas'd, without receiving
infection from ſo deſperate acommixtion, ſeems worthy of a
further inquiry than has been yet made.</p>
            <p>As to the Experiment of the exchange of blood, between
the Mangie Dog and the Sound one, by which the firſt receives
his cure, the other remains uninfected, Mr. <hi>Denis</hi> inquires
whether the blood of the Mangie Dog were putrefied, and
corrupted in his veins or not: As if putrefaction of the blood,
were neceſſarily the efficient cauſe of the Diſeaſe; but by the
common experience of Anatomy, the blood is found not to
putrefy within the vein many daies after death; much leſs than
it is to be ſuſpected ordinarily of putrefaction in the living
vein, where, by continual circulation, and the irrigation of
the vital Balſome of its volatile ſalt, congelation, the beginning
of putrefaction is moſt powerfully refitted. Beſides, the <hi>Adepti</hi>
know how to rectify the blood in all Fevers, the <hi>Galleniſts</hi> call
putrid, <hi>(citò tutò &amp; jucundè)</hi> with the precipitate Diaphoretick
of <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> But ſurely, if putrefaction be the repulſion of the
Craſis of the thing putrefied, neceſſarily inducing a new form,
the blood muſt either be granted not putrefied in the Veſſels,
or a regreſſion from privation to habit, which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Experiment, Mr. <hi>Denis</hi> ſuppoſing the blood of
the Mangie Dog to be wholly corrupted in his veins, imagines it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56531:5"/>
probable that the cooler blood of the ſound Dog, alaying the
extreame heate of the other, may work the cure; aſcribing
the Diſeaſe to the Tranſpiration of corrupted blood, and that,
to an extraordinary heat. But the blood being ſuppoſed to be
vit<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> to prevent its difflation by cooling, were ſooner to
introduce death, than a remedy; beſides, Tranſpiration is not
the effect of heat effective, but excitative only; for the blood
is prop<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly volatiz'd by the Vital ſpirit and its own Ferment,
whoſe operation is more powerful than that of Fire; for Glaſs
held for the laſt act of Fire, is really further reducible by the
help of Ferment into water. So then the action of extream
heat (ſuch as is ſuppoſed here) would rather have deſiccated and
and fixt the blood than have mov'd it to Tranſpiration; Be it
then properly the act of the Vital ſpirit and Ferment, and
not of heat, and conſequently no need of cooling in our
caſe.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Diſeaſe it ſelf, I take it to be the excretion of
an Acid ſalt from the blood, cloſing with <hi>Hippocrates Acidum,
Acre, Amarum, Ponticum,</hi> &amp;c. for Morbifick cauſes. This hoſtil
Acidity (as we ſee in Tartar of Wine, which is no other than
a congelation of the Acetous part of the Wine into Salt,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
ſome degree of fixation of the volatile Salt of the
blood, contrary to the ſcope and intention of Nature, which
is, to have it totally volatil and tranſpirable without any foeces,
is by the prepotency of the Vital ſpirit and Ferment, driven out
together with the half fix'd Salt into the skin, where for want
of volatility, it ſticks and turns to the Mange. Hence I ſuppoſe
that if the ſound Dog had been coupled up with the other for
ſome time, he had been more likely to have received his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,
than by the Transfuſion of blood.</p>
            <p>The Experience upon the youth labouring of a violent fever
and cur'd by immiſſion of the Arterial blood of a Lamb into
his veine, is more obſervable, as being more applicable to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
now As to the fever; I take it for a Maxime, <hi>Quidquid
in ſanis edit actiones ſanas, idipſum in morbis edit actiones vitiatas.</hi>
But in health the vital Spirit naturally warmes a man, the ſame
Spirit therefore <hi>aeſtuates</hi> in a fever, vehemently ſtriving to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56531:6"/>
the occaſional matter of the Diſeaſe, and this I take to be
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Spiritus impetum faciens</hi> of <hi>Hyppocrates Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
proves this by the example of a thorne run into the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which though both actually and potentially cold, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
quickly raiſes a burning, paine, and phlegmot in the
part, inasmuch as the ſenſitive Spirit being hurt by the thorne,
provokes the Archeus to expulſion, in which endeavour, the
Spirit is firſt accended and then the part: Hence expert Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
direct their cure of fevers and other acute Diſeaſes, to
the pacation of the Archeus, without purging or letting of
blood; how contrary was the procedure of thoſe Phyſitians
who blooded this youth twenty times to aſſwage the heat of
his fever; but to how little purpoſe theſe large profuſions of
blood are, may appear by the miſerable death of <hi>Pr. Ferdinand</hi>
Governer of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who in the year 41 fell ſick of a fever, his
Phyſitians (according to the method of theſe) with reiterated
Phlebotomies ſo exhauſted the ſtock of his blood, that being
dead, and his Heart, Lungs, Liver, Veines, and Arteries
diſſected in the preſence of <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> there was ſcarce found
a ſpoonfull of blood left in his body, and yet the day before his
death, he had ſuſteined as violent a fitt of his feaver as at firſt;
I leave it then to the Judgement of the indifferent Reader that
hath not Subjugated his reaſon to the Authority and vulgar
practice of others to the contrary, to judge whether Bleeding
be a proper Remedy for a fever, when the Exantlation of all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the whole Maſſe of blood, had not ſo much as made any
Diminution of the Paroxiſme. But to ſtrengthen this my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
a little further, which ſeemes to be ſingular, eaſily to gain
credit, take this familiar Inſtance: Let a veſſel of new Wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its clarification, be ſuppoſed to be agitated by a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Fermentation, which motion in the Wine (as in our caſe
of the fever) is ſtir'd up by the natural force and activity of its
Spirit, ſtriving to attain the vertue of its perfection, which
cannot be but by the ſhaking off, and Separation of the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and other wild Heterogenious and Immiſſible parts from
the truly Vinous and Homogenial; the ſcope of Nature is the
very ſame in the fit of a fever, <hi>viz.</hi> Separation, now let any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56531:6"/>
man to ſtop this Fermentation draw off a part of the Wine,
and he ſhall ſoon perceive that although he hath leſſened the
quantity of the Wine, he has by this meanes made no alteration
in the quality, the Fermentative principles in the remaining
part, keeping ſtill their natural Energie in proportion to the
whole: but if an untimely Fermentation happen, tending to
the deſtruction of the Wine, let him but caſt in a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of milk, and he ſhall quickly finde that furious orgaſme of
the Wine to ceaſe; ſo that this turbulent motion in the Wine
either ceaſes naturally, the Heterogenious parts being ſeparated
by due Fermentation, or elſe by <hi>Sedation,</hi> as in the experiment
by milk, the like method ſeemes moſt rational in the cure of a
fever, either by Medicines ſeparative, of which I prefer Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks,
or ſedative without phlebotomie, by which there
alwayes happens ſome irreparable loſſe; for though not only
the blood, but influous Spirit too, be reſtorable by our daily
food, yet the loſſe of the inſitous or innate Spirit is never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
by art or Nature; if it were it would not be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
by art to render men immortal. If then either the inſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfulneſs
of the practice, or reaſon may prevaile; I adviſe the
<hi>Galleniſts</hi> to make uſe of powerful Diaphoreticks in rectifying
the blood, or ſuch ſedative Medicines as can quiet the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montick
Spirit, rather than this needleſſe cuſtome of Bleeding.
Eſpecially ſince the <hi>Angina, Peripneumonia,</hi> and <hi>Pleuriſie</hi> can
more ſpeedily and ſecurely be cured without it. The Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor
here ſeemes to be well ſatisfied with his conceipt of
ſtagnation of the blood in the veſſels, thinking his opinion ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
confirm'd by the iſſuing forth of a blood blacker and
thicker than ordinary upon the opening of the patients vein.
But the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> in their youthful and moſt vigourous eſtate
of health, are ſaid to have their blood very black, with little or
no Serum. And upon inſpection of the blood of neer 200
ſeveral perſons drawn in one day (it being a cuſtome amongſt
the Bores in <hi>Flanders</hi> to be blooded upon a certain day) there
were found all ſorts of colours and conſiſtencies the moſt diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
imaginable to be found in blood, and the ſeveral men
from whom ſuch variety was drawn, all of them in a perfect
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56531:7"/>
ſtate of health. <hi>Van Helmont</hi> (well acquainted with the excellent
Medicinal uſe of the blood) goes further, and making choice
of the moſt different ſortes, Firſt, tryes them by their analyſes,
then by their virtues, adminiſtring them prepar'd ſeverally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Art, and finds them (notwithſtanding their diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of colours) of equal force in medicine; ſo that this ſort of
divination by colour ſeemes full of uncertainty. As Dyers out
of the ſame vate, and ſame tinging liquor, at the ſame time
give ſeveral colours, according as the ſeveral peices are various<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
praediſpos'd; ſo perhaps the univocal liquor of the Stomack
in its progreſſion to the liver, meeting by the way with ſeveral
Ferments, receives ſeveral tinctures, without any Depravation
at all of its Subſtance. For proof of this the foregoing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Now as to the proceſs; the <hi>Arterial</hi> blood of the Lamb, is
immitted into the <hi>vein,</hi> of the man the Patient finds a great
heat all a long his Arm but not any further. The reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
why he finds a heat in his Arm and no further, may be the
impetuoſity of motion in the narrow chanel of the Arm by the
irruition of a quantity of freſh blood, which entring by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavia
into the large aſcendant trunck of the <hi>Cava,</hi> though
quickening the motion there, yet having more room and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more immerg'd, the exceſſive heat ceaſes, for no more
new blood enters this great channel than paſſ'd the leſſer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
motion of impulſe is ſo much the quicker, by how much
it is neerer to the <hi>impellent.</hi> Nor ſhall I doubt to aſſigne the
cure both of his ſide and fever, principally to the nimbler cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the blood of the Patient, actuated as well by the
extrinſick motion of the Arterial blood of the Lamb, as by its
tenuity, for it may probably be ſuppos'd much thinner than the
<hi>Venal</hi> blood of the Patient, ſince naturally the <hi>Arterial</hi> blood
is thinner and moves faſter than the <hi>Venal.</hi> Nature ſeemes to
teach us not only the uſe, but even neceſſity of a nimble <hi>circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the blood by ſtirring up quicker and ſtronger pulſations in
the Heart and Artery during the criſis; here I muſt forſake <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
and not allow the principal uſe of the pulſes to be <hi>Ad cordis
refrigerium et fuliginum exploſionem;</hi> for the Heart and Arterie of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56531:7"/>
a frog (without need of refrigeration or fuliginous exploſion,
becauſe actually cold) being diſſected alive, pulſe as in other
Animals whoſe blood is actually hott; and if you will ſay that
potential ſuffices; It ſeemes abſur'd to ſuppoſe a thing bare<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<hi>in Potentia, Actu jam agere;</hi> it is more likely then on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to be <hi>Ad caloris augmentum,</hi> and that for the moſt part;
but alwayes for the production of the vital Spirit, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of it, to the languiſhing maſs; and this by traction of
Aire by the <hi>Arterial</hi> veine and <hi>venal Artery</hi> into the left ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the heart; for <hi>Gallen</hi> eſteemes Air as it were the food
of the vital Spirit, and the learned <hi>Chymiſts</hi> (not every
diſtilling Mountebanck) know how by the help of Air, to
volatize the moſt fixt Alkalious ſalts, that the force of the moſt
vehement Calcination can produce: ſo then Nature ſeemes
rather to intend Volatization than Refrigeration, by the pulſes;
for as <hi>Bartholinus</hi> obſerves in acute fevers, and moſt violent
Ebullitions of the blood, the pulſe is often weak and low,
which otherwiſe ought then to be ſtrongeſt. This being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
let us ſee in our caſe, what probability of quickening, the
motion and volatization of our Patients diſeaſ'd blood by
this immiſſion of the blood of a Lamb; and what other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
may occur by this commixion tending to a cure.</p>
            <p>I have already ſhew'd how the motion of the Patients blood,
might be advanced by the Impulſion and Attenuation of the
other; there is yet a more natural way, which is, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a new Ferment. This, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls Divine,
and is the undoubted parent of natural motion, <hi>Cum tendentia</hi>
(ſays the excellent Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in his book <hi>de Fermentatione) ad
perfectionem, vel propter mutationem in aliud.</hi> Now the motion
requir'd in our caſe, tending to the Melioration of the blood,
and conſequent cure of the fever, is, that it be throughly
volatiz'd, and diſpos'd to an eaſy tranſpiration; Hence <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi>
and <hi>Van Helmont</hi> (next to their great univerſal medicines
conquering all diſeaſes) commend the volatil ſalt of Roſemary,
Sage, Rue, &amp;c. for the cure of fevers, and the volatil
ſalt of Tartar, for the cure of allmoſt all diſeaſes; wee ſee how
ſoon a little Spirit of Wine cheers and quickens the vital Spirit,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56531:8"/>
by mingling it ſelf preſently with it by reaſon of their Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie;
but the Spirit of Wine is nothing but the ſolution of its
volatile Salt; for it may by the ſpirit of Urine or Salt of Tartar,
be corporified into a manifeſt and palpable ſaline concretion,
and indeed it is in this inſtance by contact of the Vital Ferment
preſenty turn'd into a volatile ſaline nature, ſuch as is the Vital
ſpirit it ſelf. Now that the Vital ſpirit is of a ſaline nature,
ſeems evident by the teſtimony of Senſe, for if a part happen
to be torpid or benum'd, by any accidental prohibition for a
while of the influx of the Animal ſpirit, which acquires no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
tranſmutation in the <hi>medulla oblongata,</hi> nor other difference
from the Vital, <hi>ſane gradu perfectivo,</hi> upon the return I ſay of this
ſpirit to the ſuccour of the part labouring, we find a kind of
ſtinging and pricking, and infallible Index of its ſaltneſs; as is
its total difflation in healthful bodies, of its volatility: I
mean here the Influous ſpirit, which is continually reſtor'd,
not to the Inſitous, whoſe decay is naturally attended with
irrepairable weakneſs and its total extinction or efflation,
with preſent death. Let us now ſee if we can find ſuch
active principles in the blood of the Lamb thus emitted
without diminution of its vital energie, as may ſuffice for the
actuating of the languiſhing Ferment of the blood of the
Patient.</p>
            <p>It cannot be deny'd, but that the blood of Beaſts as well as
men, is full of Vital ſpirit, and volatile Salt. <hi>Fernelius (de ſpiritu
viventium)</hi> defines the ſpirit of all living creatures to be <hi>Corpus
aetherium,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> holds it to be of a Caeleſtial Divine nature;
anſwering to the Element of the Starrs. There cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
then be ſo great a diſſimilarity between the Vital ſpirit
of the Lamb, and that of the Man, but that the firſt, (elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in its way to the patients heart, by the Action of the Innate
ſpirit implanted in every part, and afterwards by the force of
the Vital Ferment in the left Ventricle, which <hi>Helmont</hi> calls
<hi>(Maxime vitale &amp; luminoſum)</hi> may eaſily be tranſmuted, and
aſſimilated into the latter; and the Archeus of the Patient thus
fortified might well overcome his diſeaſe, Nature being her
ſelf (if freed from impediment) <hi>Morborum Curatrix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56531:8"/>
Now as to the volatile Salt, it may be eſteemed the Balſome
of life, and preſerver of the whole body from corruption, upon
whoſe Oeconomy depends the juſt Circulation, and (as I ſaid) the
Difflation of the blood; and upon theſe, the preſervation of the
life of the Individual: This Salt reſolves the Congelations of
extravaſated blood, opens Obſtructions in the Veins, reſiſts and
conquers Acidity; <hi>Omnem Aciditatem quam attingit, perimit,</hi> ſaies
<hi>Helmont;</hi> but Acidity (according to him) out of the ſtomack is
inimicous to the whole body, <hi>Exorbitans Peſtilenſve impreſſio

                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>
id locorum contigerit.</hi> Beſides theſe more than ſufficiently power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Operations of the Vital ſpirit and Volatile Salt, there are
yet in the blood innumerable ſecret medicinal Virtues. The
blood of a ſound man prepared according to <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the conſent of the moſt learned and experienc'd
Chymiſts, to cure Radically the Epilepſic Palſie, Apoplexie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated
lungs, and Pleurifie; and (if <hi>Faber</hi> deſerve credit) may
worthily be eſteemed amongſt the greateſt <hi>Arcana.</hi> The
blood of an Aſſe is ſaid to cure a Quotidian Fever, and of an
Aſſes Colt the Yellow Jaundies. The blood of a male Goate
rightly prepar'd (for as 'tis found in Apothecaries ſhops it failes)
certainly cures the Pleuriſie and Peripneumonia. The blood
of an Oxe is ſaid to cure the Dyſenterie. The blood of a Cat
cures the Falling-ſickneſs and Herpes. Of the blood of a male
Deer is made a Balſom againſt the Gout. The blood of a
Fox is an excellent remedy againſt the Stone in the Reins or
Bladder. If then Blood extravaſated be endued with ſo many
admirable and powerful virtues, what may we expect from it
communicated (as in this our Experiment) without any loſs at
all of its mumial virtues? ſurely ſuch an addition of Vital trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to the depauperated ſtore, muſt needs enrich it with new
ſtrength, quicken all the Vital faculties, and might with very
good reaſon overcome our Patients Fever.</p>
            <p>There is yet a conſideration which perhaps may not ſeem
vain to ſuch as are acquainted with Hermetick Philoſophy, and
'tis this, a Lamb is eſteemed to be the meekeſt and moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Animal Nature has brought forth; why then might not his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56531:9"/>
blood ſigillated with conformable Idea's, by the imagination
of the Archeus, introduce ſuch a pacation into the tumultuous
blood of the Patient as was ſufficient for his cure? For thus cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Arcana</hi> prepared by ſecret Art (unknown to all vulgar Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts)
by inducing onely reſt and in the Enormontick ſpirit, are
eſteem'd by <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Van Helmont</hi> (and ſome of them
known to my ſelf) for almoſt Univerſal Medicines.</p>
            <p>Since then the practice of this new method of Healing by
<hi>Transfuſion of Blood,</hi> ſeems to be warranted both by reaſon and
experience, I adviſe the curious Experimentor, to make trial
upon Animals of the longeſt life, ſuch as are Staggs, Eagles,
Crows, &amp;c. for the prolongation of life; And in the cure
of Diſeaſes, to make choice of ſuch Animals as by their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
proprieties are found to have curative virtues peculiar to
ſeveral Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given a gueſs at the reaſon of this new and
(till of late) unheard of way of curing, by <hi>Tranfuſion of Blood,</hi>
which if I have err'd, let it ſerve for my excuſe, that no man has
gone before me to ſhew the way.</p>
