            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Parishioners of Trinity,
GRACE &amp; PEACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S you have the <hi>Plague</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in your streets, so you are to take
notice of a <hi>worser,</hi> even the <hi>Spiritual
Plague</hi> of your <hi>Hearts.</hi> To this purpose
I hope <hi>this short Discourse</hi> may be
somewhat serviceable, which (even when it shall please
God to take away the <hi>Bodily Disease)</hi> may still be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to you, to guard you against the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but
more poisonous Distemper. It is recorded to the honour
of Queen <hi>Eleanor,</hi> that when her Royall Husband in
the Holy War was wounded with a poisoned Knife by a
desperate Saracen, the Incomparable Lady sucked the
poison out of his Wound. A signal instance of her Love
to him! Sin, Beloved, is Poison: I wish unfeignedly, I
could by any holy skill and method, ease you of <hi>that more
dangerous Venom</hi> at your <hi>Hearts:</hi> O that this <hi>Paper</hi>
might prove a <hi>Plaister</hi> to <hi>draw it!</hi> It is true, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
my self one of the meanest and unworthiest of all those
<hi>Physitians and Guides of Souls</hi> that are in the Church: I
may not be able to treat so successfully of this <hi>Spiritual
Disease</hi> as those worthy persons, who are of <hi>greater pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>
and <hi>larger experience.</hi> But I request you, that when
you make tryal of what is <hi>here,</hi> you would call upon <hi>God</hi>
for a <hi>blessing;</hi> and if you find any good, thank <hi>God</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:109227:3"/>
it, not <hi>me.</hi> I will not beg your excuse, by telling you <hi>these</hi>
are very slender Preparations for the Press; for I chose
rather to hasten this little Thing, and give it you <hi>as it is,</hi>
then to loose the opportunity of <hi>doing good,</hi> by making it
<hi>better.</hi> There is nothing in it can render it worthy of the
publick view, but its seasonableness, and your kind accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of it. Many of the <hi>Directions</hi> which you will meet
with, I gave you lately in some of my Sermons which I
Preached since the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath been heavy upon
this Town. I must tell you, I designed not <hi>language,</hi> but
<hi>living well.</hi> It is not required that the <hi>Physitians Bill</hi> be
curiously Penned, but that the Medicines be there faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
prescribed. Besides, a <hi>gaudy</hi> and <hi>flaunting</hi> stile is no
ways suitable to these <hi>Mournfull Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have onely this to beg of you, that you would be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of me at the Throne of Grace, beseeching the Lord that
he would crown my <hi>Ministery</hi> with the conversion &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of many souls, and that he would make me feel the
power and influence of those saving Truths upon <hi>my own
heart</hi> which I deliver unto <hi>you.</hi> And my earnest Prayer
for you shall be, that <hi>ye may walk worthy of the Lord
unto all pleasing, being fruitfull in every good work,
and increasing in the knowledge of God: that ye may
approve things that are excellent, that ye may be
sincere, and without offence, till the day of Christ;
being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are
by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 KINGS 8. 38.</bibl>
               <q>—Which shall know every man the Plague of his
own heart.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words are part of King <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer,
which he made at the dedication of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
the drift of the whole is, that God would
be pleased, whensoever any judgements and
calamities befall the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to hear their requests, and
answer their prayers put up in that place, and to remove
their crosses, and forgive their sins. This is the design of the Prayer;<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> and the Lord appeared to <hi>Solomon</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
assuring him,<note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> that he had heard this his supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Here then is a refuge and an escape for penitent
sinners, against Distresses, Plagues, and Troubles; But
every Prayer will not prove effectuall; observe therefore
the severall Requisites fairly intimated in this Holy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> namely, <hi>confessing of Gods name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of sins,</hi> and <hi>turning from them;</hi> and then lastly, the
prayer and supplication must be made by those <hi>Israelites
which shall know every man the Plague of his own heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which shall [<hi>know.</hi>]</p>
            <p>1. Take notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109227:4"/>
2. Lament and be sorry for.</p>
            <p>3. Avert and cure.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Every man.</hi>] Every one, all persons of both sexes,
of all qualities.</p>
            <p>[<hi>The Plague.</hi>] 1. The <hi>stroke,</hi> the <hi>blow;</hi> that's the
Originall signification.</p>
            <p>2. Any great judgement sent by God for the punishing
of sin, the lashes of the Divine Nemes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, strokes on the
estates or bodies of men.</p>
            <p>3. That signall <hi>stroke</hi> of God, that <hi>Plaga Dei,</hi> that
infectious and fatall Disease which we call the <hi>Sickness</hi>
with an Emphasis. Thus the word imports, but here it is
applyed to the</p>
            <p>[<hi>Heart.</hi>] 1. The soul and its faculties, principally;
they received a <hi>blow,</hi> a foul knock in <hi>Adam;</hi> and since
they are bruised daily by our venturing at the breach of
Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The life and practice, consequently; for</hi> out of the
Heart are the issues of Life.</p>
            <p>So that as we consider in the Heart in mans Body, its
passages, apartments, and ventricles; so here we may
well understand, both the corrupt principles and evill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of our natures, and the vanities and follies of our
lives, which are but the emanations of the former.</p>
            <p>[<hi>His own Heart.</hi>] The man is to look into his own
breast, and see if he find any <hi>tokens</hi> there, he must live at
home, he hath work to do within doors.</p>
            <p>So that I might present you with an Observation from
every word; but my design at present is onely to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
from these words to treat of the <hi>Plague of the Heart;</hi>
for though (as I have intimated already) the word here
used, doth not properly and primarily signifie the <hi>Disease</hi>
of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> yet in the Verse foregoing it is joyned
with <hi>(Sickness) [whatsoever Plague,<note place="margin">Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se 37.</note> whatsoever sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there be,</hi>] and it plainly referrs to the <hi>Pestilence</hi> or
<hi>Plague</hi> Emphatically so called. [<hi>If there be Pestilence</hi> in
the Land] One Plague suggested another to the good
mans thoughts: and indeed it is no unusuall thing with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons, to make even the <hi>diseases</hi> of their <hi>bodies,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
matter of devout meditation for the <hi>health</hi> of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109227:4"/>
their <hi>souls:</hi> there is nothing that they see, but it brings
God to their thoughts, there is nothing in Nature, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Providence that they converse with, but their
sanctified minds can make some good use of: a devout
Fancy turneth earth into heaven, and all secular occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
into something Divine and Spirituall. Did not our
Saviour make use of Parabolicall speeches to slip in to the
fancies, and prevaile upon the affections of his Auditours,
and to represent to them heavenly matters more forcibly
and lively? to this purpose serve all those excellent Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
and choise Metaphors which the Holy Scripture is
full of; amongst the latter, that which I have now pitched
upon is no contemptible one.</p>
            <p>Sin is the distemper and sickness of the soul; which the
good Psalmist knew well enough, when he made that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
<hi>Heal my soul,<note place="margin">Psal. 41. 4.</note> for I have sinned against thee.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is Sin any light and inconsiderable distemper: all the
laws and rules concerning the Leprosie of old, do but sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
to us more plainly the grievous nature of sin: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>words</hi> and <hi>doctrines</hi> of vitious men and hereticks, are
compared by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> to a <hi>Canker</hi> or <hi>Gangreen:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 17.</note> nay, the
sinner is a most wretched Lazar, and his soul a very Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of diseases,<note place="margin">Isai. 1. 5, 6.</note> sicknesses, sores and bruises; <hi>the whole
head is sick, the whole heart faint, from the sole of the foot,
even unto the head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds,
and bruises, and putrifying sores.</hi> And then (as the summ
of all) the sinner is an <hi>Infected</hi> person, he hath the <hi>Plague,</hi>
the worst of Plagues, the <hi>Plague of the Heart.</hi> It will be
worth our while, to search into the nature of <hi>this deadly
disease,</hi> to shew the resemblance between the <hi>spirituall</hi>
and <hi>bodily Plague,</hi> and to know the nature of <hi>the one</hi> by
<hi>the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They agree as to their generall <hi>Nature,</hi> and may be fitly
expressed in the same terms; for the best masters of Physick
acquaint us, that the Pestilence is a dangerous <hi>Poison</hi> which
corrupts and invenoms the bloud, and taints the spirits,
and spoils the agreement and harmony of the parts of
mans body. And Sin is the <hi>Poison</hi> that seizes on our
<hi>souls</hi> and spreads it self into our members and senses. Of the

full of deadly poison,</hi> the Heart is much more so. In short,
the least sin is rank poison, it corrupts and debauches our
minds, perverts our faculties, destroyes our good principles,
it forces even nature it self, it is violent, and disagreable to
rectified reason, it is improportionate to our souls, it puts
all out of order and due frame, and brings in unspeakable
confusion. Poison cannot make greater havock on our
bodys, then Sin on our immortall souls. But because the
Essences and abstract natures of things are hard to find out,
we shall view it further in its Effects and products, and in
its Cure too: as Physitians say, that by these we shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know what the disease is. But before we come to
those, let us stay a while and consider the <hi>Original</hi> &amp; <hi>Causes</hi>
of the <hi>Spirituall Plague,</hi> or the way how it is propagated.</p>
            <p>And in this too, as well as in the other, it will appear
that the <hi>Bodily</hi> and <hi>Ghostly</hi> disease resemble one another.</p>
            <p>For, not to speak here of the primary cause of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
and of the Pestilence more signally (which all but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists
acknowledge to be the hand of God,) nor to reckon
up all other causes which are assigned, many of which are in
the dark and can scarcely be explained, without a piece of
old Philosophy called <hi>Occult Qualities;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two main Naturall and Secundary causes of the
<hi>Pestilence,</hi> may very well intimate unto us the rise of the
<hi>Spirituall Plague; (viz.)</hi> Inward corruption, Outward
infection.</p>
            <p>1. That originall corruption and pollution which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the loyns of our first Parents: which though
indeed it may seem to be a cause of the second rank, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we bring it into the world with us, and it is rivetted so
fast into the hearts of the best here on earth, because it is
something bred within and brought up with us; therefore I
call it the <hi>Inward corruption,</hi> and that which answers to
the <hi>putrefaction of the humours in</hi> the body, which is the
root of the Pestilence. And thus there being something
corrupted within,</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis no wonder that there is an <hi>Outward infection &amp;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109227:5"/>
Corruption (the corruption of our ways)</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Mich 7. 3.</note> that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the corruption unto others, and are again infected
by the vitious world. For as we experience that men by
lying or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting with infected persons, or by keeping some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on which the contagion hath seized, or by taking in
unholsome vapours and exhalations with the common air,
have the <hi>Plague</hi> derived unto them; just so is Sin propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
and increased: Whilest we more nearly converse
with our wicked neighbours, we participate of that <hi>fatall
poyson,</hi> which will destroy both them and us.</p>
            <p>But let us passe from the <hi>Causes</hi> to the <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes</hi>
of this <hi>Spirituall Plague,</hi> by which I mean all the
sad attendants and consequences of the disease; and here
we will set down those severall Passions, Tokens, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications
by which men commonly judge of the <hi>Bodily
Plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin first with the excessive <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Inflammation</hi>
which attends the disease: the Sinner is one always in a
feaver; and therefore that expression of the Evangelicall
Prophet is worth our notice, who reproves the Jews for
<hi>inflaming themselves with Idols;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 5.</note> and not onely the fond wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
of Idols, but every sinfull passion and pursuit of lust
is furious and enraged, fierce and fiery, and (which is a sad
truth) these <hi>flames</hi> are but a prologue to <hi>everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
But as a man in a violent feavour is <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi>
and yet so <hi>strong</hi> that he is able enough to beat his best
friends, and those that would hold him within his bed; so
fares it with every sick sinner. Which leads me to the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Symptome</hi> (which naturally follows from that exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
heat;) namely</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inordinate motions, restlessnesse and unrulinesse.</hi> And
here I might lead you to the sinners chamber; draw aside
the curtains, and let you see how he <hi>tumbles</hi> and <hi>tosses:</hi> you
may think he sleeps soundly; yet you cannot say he <hi>takes
his rest. The wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

peace;<note place="margin">I saiah 57. 20, 21.</note> saith my God, to the wicked.</hi> It is Sin that overturns
the course of nature, and raises tumults both in the world
and in the sinners conscience, and at last these exorbitances,
these <hi>hot fits,</hi> bring the man to <hi>distraction.</hi> Which is the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109227:6"/>
               <hi>third Symptome</hi> of the disease, for sin is a violent <hi>madness,</hi>
a strange <hi>distraction</hi> of the mind and reason, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a man from himself: In this <hi>Phrentick state</hi> was
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> once, when he punished and persecuted many of the
Saints; you have the confession from his own mouth that he
was <hi>exceedingly mad against them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 26. 11.</note> And idolatry (which
you heard before was an inflammation) is in another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
account no less then <hi>madness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 50. 38.</note> Sin then is the worst
<hi>delirium</hi> and <hi>phrensie,</hi> for in this mad humour men abuse and
barbarously wound their own souls, which the Wise man
knew well when he said of sinners <hi>(they lay wait for their
own bloud,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 18.</note> they lurk privily for their own lives.)</hi> And this
<hi>madness</hi> is <hi>long</hi> and <hi>lasting,</hi> (as the same Preacher delivers
it) <hi>(the heart of the sons of men is full of evil; and madness
is in their heart while they live.)</hi> I might add another
Symptome near of kin to this, which sometimes attends the
Bodily Plague, but always the Spirituall. I mean a strange
<hi>vertigo</hi> and <hi>meagrim</hi> which every wicked man is troubled
with; else he would not <hi>stagger</hi> so shamefully as he doth,
and <hi>decline</hi> his duty, and <hi>giddily</hi> rush into evil company,
and suffer himself to be <hi>shaken</hi> from the truth, and (as the
Apostle phrases it) [<hi>be carried about with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>]
Again look as when the Poyson hath seized on
the whole mass of bloud and got possession of the heart,
the usuall and equall mixture of the bloud is spoiled, and
thence followeth a coagulation and stagnation of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
so is it in the <hi>Spirituall Plague,</hi> which makes the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>cold</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> benummed, and indisposed to every ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
action: his heart like <hi>Naballs, dyes within him, and
he becomes as a stone.</hi> The <hi>Holy Spirit is</hi> stifled; then it is
no wonder that the man grows stupid, that his pulse is so
low and languide: <hi>swoonings</hi> and <hi>faintings</hi> are no unusuall
things in the <hi>Plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then in the next place, the bloud being putrified and
invenomed, and it's motion retarded, we see that <hi>boiles</hi> and
<hi>swellings, spots</hi> and the like <hi>tokens</hi> discover themselves in
the outward parts. And are there not as sad <hi>breakings out</hi>
of sin, are there not fouler <hi>blemishes</hi> and <hi>spots</hi> upon every
wicked man? else what mean those palpable <hi>risings</hi> of lust
and uncleanness? What are those <hi>swellings</hi> and <hi>tumours</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:109227:6"/>
of pride? What are those dismall <hi>characters</hi> and worser sort
of <hi>Carbuncles</hi> in the intemperate person and common drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard?
What are those lamentable and apparent marks,
those <hi>blows</hi> and <hi>bruises</hi> which oppression and cruelty are
the cause of? What are those curses and oaths which I
hear from the swearers mouth? such <hi>breaking out at the
lips,</hi> is no good sign in the spirituall patient. Alass! how
many ways doth a naughty heart discover it self? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Plague-sores</hi> doth the sinner carry about with him?
Upon this must follow another effect and consequent,
namely, <hi>Filthiness, pollution,</hi> and <hi>noisomness:</hi> but of this
loathsome attendant on the Spirituall Plague, I shall speak
some what when I come to consider the cure of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The next sad companions of the Plague (as of most sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses)
are <hi>anguish,</hi> and <hi>aches, pain</hi> and <hi>disease.</hi> Sure I am they
are the inseparable associates of the <hi>Plague</hi> of <hi>sin;</hi> out of
the <hi>corruption</hi> of mans heart is soon bred the <hi>worm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
Horrour and a certain looking for of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a sting and tortures, these are things that flagitious
sinners know at the first naming: and as wounds and sores
do usually prick and pain most towards night, so when
<hi>death</hi> approaches, the guilty conscience finds it's torments
doubled and redoubled upon it.</p>
            <p>I might add another Indication and Symptome, which
is common to the Plague with all other sicknesses, and that
is a certain <hi>nauseating</hi> and <hi>refusing of food,</hi> as it must needs
be when the pallate is out of taste and cannot relish, and the
corrupt matter hath infected the stomach. Thus is it with
a sick sinner, he hath lost his <hi>spirituall taste,</hi> and cannot <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the things of God,</hi> but in the mean time the sweets and
delights of the wicked world strike briskly upon his vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
pallate, and are taken down with a huge <hi>complacency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to leave these more common Signs, I pass to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
direct and <hi>proper</hi> Symtome, which is the <hi>Pestilentiall
malignity and Contagion,</hi> which ever waits upon the Plague,
it is of that ill nature that it propagates and derives it self
from one to another. <hi>Adam</hi> was the first that had the
<hi>Spirituall Plague,</hi> and he got it by eating the forbidden fruit,
and since it hath sadly spread and descended from one
to another. All sin to this day <hi>is Epidemicall</hi> and <hi>catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:109227:7"/>
we are corrupted our selves, and we corrupt others.</p>
            <p>How many are there that take a course to damne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
but that is not all, they must damne their friends
and neighbours too. This, this is the nature of sin, it diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it self in a large circle, it runs as in a train, and doth mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
on all sides, it over-runs the whole man, soul and body.</p>
            <p>Our Inward man, that is first depraved and infected. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
the brain is faulty, the understanding blind and dark,
it is dull to conceive what is good and vertuous, but it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
vain, unprofitable, and fruitless notions, it is stuffed with
carnall reasonings, fleshly wisdome, fond disputes, pride
and false principles: there is errour, folly, rashness, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
raigning in the judgement:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note>
               <hi>We are vain in our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and our foolish heart is darkned.<note place="margin">Jer. 4 22.</note> We are wise to do
evil, but to do good we have no knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the affections too there is inordinacy, coldness and
inpotency, a loving of what we should hate, and a hating of
what we should love.</p>
            <p>The infection seizes also on our memories; as <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
tells us of some persons who were infected in that
great plague at <hi>Athens,</hi> that by reason of that sad distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
they forgot themselves, their friends and all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.
Most certain it is that by the Spirituall infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
men forget God and their duty, and their memories
are onely tenacious in holding what is evil, especially vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and injuries.</p>
            <p>The will likewise receives no litle damage by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,
it being made weak and feeble, and wholly indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to good, it draws back at the proposall of vertue, but is
resolute, obstinate and stubborn in the ways of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
The conscience is dull and dead, and (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
well expresses it) <hi>is seared with a hot iron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2.</note> it dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not it is office aright either in acquitting or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but is sadly insensible, presumptuous and desperate.</p>
            <p>I might proceed to shew you how all the parts and
members of the body are tainted and infected,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13.</note> and are
(in the Apostles words) <hi>instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will say something of the <hi>adherency</hi> and <hi>pertinacy</hi>
of this Spirituall disease, the infection sticks close and cleavs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109227:7"/>
to our nature,<note place="margin">Levit. 14. 41.</note> it is like the <hi>fretting leprosie</hi> in the wall; the
wall must be pulled down before it can be extirpated. We
must be striving every day against our lusts, but they will
not be quite rooted out, the <hi>leprosie of the soul</hi> will not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be removed till the wall be thrown down, till the house
be dissolved, even our <hi>house of clay.</hi> And as we see the <hi>Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce</hi>
lyes still and dormant for a long time, and then
breaks forth more furiously, being rouzed (as it were) from
sleep, it gets up and spreads it arms wider, to take in greater
numbers into it's fatall embraces: so is it oftentimes with
this <hi>Spirituall distemper,</hi> it seems to be quelled and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but soon after it regains it's strength and by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of that evil Spirit it makes fresh assaults upon us, and
we are brought into it's subjection more then ever.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That which brings up the rear in the <hi>Body of
sin,</hi> is <hi>the decay of strength, weakness, universall languor,</hi>
and <hi>a sudden approach of death.</hi> For as in the disease now
reigning, the spirits are seized upon, their strength and
vigour is exhausted, and so consequently, the motions
and functions of the body are hindered and destroyed, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is debilitated, and the strength failes; so doth the
Infected Sinner grow <hi>sicker</hi> and <hi>weaker,</hi> fainter and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
every day, disabled to perform any offices of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
And the case being thus, death is making it's fatall
approaches; as we see in Infected Persons, when the <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
hath fully seized on the throne of life, and it's retinue,
the vitall spirits, nothing but death is exspected; the
throbbs at the heart, and the faint and uneven <hi>pulses,</hi> are but
as so many sad <hi>tolles</hi> of the <hi>Passing-Bell:</hi> so may you even
<hi>Ring out</hi> for the sinner; after so many sad Symptoms that
I have named, it is no wonder that he dyeth, and that being
dead in sin, he also dyeth eternally.</p>
            <p>The disease then being (in it self) mortall, let us
learn from the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Symptoms,</hi> what may be the
most effectuall way to <hi>prevent</hi> it, and <hi>preserve</hi> our selves
from it.</p>
            <p>In order then to <hi>Prevention</hi> and a happy <hi>Cure,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labour to <hi>know</hi> the disease; 'tis true here, as in other
distempers, the perfect knowledge of them is half the cure.
Do therefore what thou canst, to see the odiousness of sin
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109227:8"/>
in it self, and how loathsome it makes us in the eyes of
God, <hi>who is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity.</hi> All the
laws of old about uncleaness, (as I have told you before)
were designed on purpose, to express the pollution of sin;
for there is nothing but <hi>this</hi> can defile us, nothing but <hi>this</hi>
can separate us from the favour of God. The Poets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
present some of their Gods obscene and debauched,
lustfull and impure; but our God, as he is purity it self,
so nothing can make him abhorre a creature, but what is
contrary to it. 'Tis sin therefore, and that onely which
stains and defiles us, which slurrs and debases us, in the
midst of all our riches and honours.</p>
            <p>Again, In order to the Cure, know that the <hi>Spirituall
Plague</hi> is the worst sort of Plagues: all the <hi>Plagues</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> were nothing in comparison of his
<hi>hardness</hi> of <hi>heart:</hi> all the boyls and blains, the froggs and
lice, and swarms of flies, were not half so dangerous and
destructive, as <hi>the Plague of his heart.</hi> For consider with
me, that</p>
            <p>1. <hi>This</hi> seizes on the <hi>best</hi> part, the <hi>soul</hi> of man, which
was made for God, and bears his Superscription.</p>
            <p>2. This being a <hi>Spirituall Plague,</hi> is therefore <hi>Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and hard to be discerned; <hi>this,</hi> rather then the <hi>other,</hi>
may be called the <hi>Pestilence that walketh in darkness,</hi> it
destroys silently; and this <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rthering-piece</hi> (as they say
of a piece charged with white Powder) goeth off without
a <hi>Report.</hi> Some sins there are, which like Plants and
Herbs, have no visible motion in their growth, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
by degrees, softly and insensibly; though it must
be confessed, there are others which are so plain and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
written in so <hi>large a Character,</hi> that <hi>he that runs
may read them.</hi> Some persons indeed there are, that are
so fouly Infected, that every one may see, that <hi>their spot
is not the spot of Gods Children:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 5.</note> But there are others, that
are not so much as <hi>suspected,</hi> and they may pass for <hi>Clear-Corps,</hi>
let the <hi>spiritual Searchers</hi> be never so inquisitive.
The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> gives the reason,<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 9.</note> [<hi>The heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
above all things, and desperately wicked, who can
know it?</hi>] The scene of vice is the Heart, which is remote;
and therefore to be vitious and to be known to be so, are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109227:8"/>
two things. Thus, though in the <hi>late</hi> Philosophers sense,
<hi>The mind be more knowable then the body,</hi> yet the <hi>diseases</hi>
of the forner, are harder to be discovered then those of
the latter,</p>
            <p>3. As it destroys more <hi>silently,</hi> so more <hi>suddenly</hi> then
and <hi>Bodily Plague;</hi> it hides it's fatall shafts for a while, but
then it surprises the poor sinner unawares, and wounds
him without hope of cure.</p>
            <p>4. It <hi>sticks closer,</hi> and <hi>stays longer: this</hi> is that which
<hi>doth so easily beset us;</hi> this is (in the <hi>Apostles</hi> language)
<hi>Sin that dwels in us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> which is hereditary and inseparable;
and (as I have told you already,)<note place="margin">Rom 7. 17.</note> is like that <hi>fretting le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie,</hi>
which could not be removed, without demolishing
of the house it self. 'Tis sad to consider, how invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
this Plague grows by custome and frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
<hi>Can the Aethiopian change his skin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 13. 23.</note> 
               <hi>or the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard
his spots? then may ye also do good that are accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It <hi>spreads further:</hi> it diffuseth it's poyson on all our
duties, actions, and performances: the poyson is in the
very fountain, and so derives it's hurtfull nature to the
streams; or, like polluted vessels, we taint all that is
poured into us;<note place="margin">Isa. 64. 6.</note> 
               <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our
righteousness is as filthy raggs.</hi> Our most solemn atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances
on God in his Ordinances, our praying, hearing,
reading, and conversing, as well as all our actions in our
particular callings, are more or less, <hi>touched</hi> with this <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

Which I take to be the meaning of those words of the
<hi>Preacher,<note place="margin">Ecclesiastes 9. 18.</note> [One sinner destroyeth much good:</hi>] he is able
to infect whole Families and Towns, if he be not careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

dangerous in this affair. Alas, poor souls, <hi>now
is</hi> the time for you to see your Plague, and understand
your misery; for if you stay till death, then indeed will
you see it with a witness. Oh! <hi>then</hi> the guilty soul will
know what it is to be void of grace and holiness, but it
will not know how to help and recover it self. So it is, that
one minutes delay may cost thee thy life.</p>
            <p>Look out then for a Physitian presently; <hi>Naaman</hi>
when he had the leprosie, repaired to the <hi>Prophet.</hi> Some
there are, that nominate a particular Saint, as a proper
Physitian, for every distinct disease: and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Sebastian</hi>
hath the <hi>Plague</hi> for his charge belike. Sure it is, that
there are Quacks and Empricks enough in the world, who
can <hi>palliate</hi> the disease, and <hi>skin over</hi> the wound, but
know not how to <hi>cure</hi> either. There are <hi>Doctors</hi> who
prescribe Physick, which leavs the Patient as sick as it
found him: he is sick at <hi>Heart</hi> still; I, <hi>there</hi> indeed lies
the distemper, at the <hi>Heart:</hi> the cure must be wrought
within, the applications must be such, as are able, not
onely to <hi>stint</hi> and <hi>silence</hi> the pain for a while, to <hi>mitigate</hi>
and <hi>asswage</hi> the grieved part, but to <hi>remove</hi> even the very
<hi>cause</hi> of the distemper. Wine and merry company, the
pleasures and entertains of the world, their jollities and
catches may <hi>sing</hi> the mans sorrow asleep, and flatter his
disease for a time; but <hi>haeret lateri lethalis arundo,</hi> the
poysoned Arrow sticks fast in him, and the disease by such
methods as this is not eradicated. Thus there are <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
of no value, miserable comforters</hi> to the sick sinner,
who (with the Woman in the Gospel) may spend all he
hath upon them, and yet be never the better. But there
is <hi>balm in Gilead,</hi> there is a <hi>Physitian there: Whether
should we go but unto Christ? he hath the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life.</hi> But be sure you be not defective in these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things.</p>
            <p>1. Have a good opinion of Him: great hopes may
be conceived of thy doing well if thou <hi>likest</hi> thy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian.</p>
            <p>2. Despise not the <hi>meanest</hi> advice: if it be but [<hi>wash
and be clean,</hi>] hearken unto it. The <hi>cheapest</hi> Medicine may
be the best. But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:109227:10"/>
3. If it should be <hi>chargable,</hi> and must cost thee pains,
refuse not the Physick upon that account; Or</p>
            <p>4. If it seem <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>bitter,</hi> no ways pleasant and
toothsome, take it down thankfully; as we take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Physick, and are content to be sick, that we may
be well.</p>
            <p>Thou being thus prepared before-hand, and answering
affirmatively to that question which our Saviour put to the
diseased; [<hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi>] I commend unto
thee these following <hi>Preservatives</hi> and <hi>Antidotes</hi> against
the <hi>Plague</hi> of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is a <hi>holy fear</hi> of the <hi>Spirituall Plague.</hi> Be affraid
to offend God. <hi>Ioseph</hi> made use of this <hi>preservative,</hi>
when he was set upon and assaulted by his lascivious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 9.</note> [<hi>How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</hi>] So true is that of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 16.</note> [<hi>A wise wan feareth,
and departeth from evill.</hi>] That we may then avoid the
<hi>infection</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> let us be <hi>working out our salvation with
fear and trembling:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 8. 13.</note> let us <hi>sanctifie the Lord of Hosts, and
let him be our fear, and let him be our dread:</hi> And let
Christ his Advice to his Apostles prevail here,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 28.</note> [<hi>Fear not
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul;
but rather fear him, which is able to destroy both soul and
body in hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second rule for preventing the <hi>Spirituall Plague</hi> is,
that we shun all <hi>Infected places and persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. All places and dwellings where sin takes up it's
abode, and keeps open house, for the entertainment of
all comers. Such are those <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Vice, Shops</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi>
and <hi>Nurseries</hi> of <hi>Prophaness</hi> and <hi>Lewdness,</hi> which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
are erected in every <hi>City</hi> and great <hi>Town.</hi> We
must be carefull that we <hi>Walk not in the counsel of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>godly, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat
of the scornfull;</hi> or, <hi>in the chair of Pestilences,</hi> (as
the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render it.) But the places are to be
avoided</p>
            <p>2. For the persons sake. You are therefore to reckon
notorious sinners, as those that have the <hi>Plague-sores</hi>
upon them: by associating with them, you partake of
their sin; your commerce with them draws the infection
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109227:10"/>
to your selves. <hi>This</hi> is the reason of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> counsel
which he gave his <hi>Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 11</note> [Have no fellowship with the
unfruitfull works of darkness.</hi>] And of <hi>Solomons</hi> dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
[<hi>Enter not into the path of the wicked,<note place="margin">Prov. 4 14, 15.</note> and go not
into the way of evill men, avoid it, pass not by it, turn
from it and pass away.</hi>] And more particularly he guards
us against the <hi>strange Woman,</hi> as if she (as well as others
of her wicked profession) were <hi>Infected,<note place="margin">Prov. 5. 8.</note> [Remove thy way
far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house;</hi>] for
(as he adds) [<hi>Whosoever toucheth her,<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 29.</note> shall not be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>]
The <hi>Psalmists practice</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> should be
our pattern,<note place="margin">Psal. 26. 4, 5, 6</note> [<hi>I have not sat with vain persons, neither
will I go in with dissemblers: I have hated the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of evill doers, and will not sit with the wicked:</hi>] and it
follows, [<hi>I will wash my hands in innocency, and so will I
compass <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ine Altar, O Lord.</hi>] The Good man washed
his hands, before he conversed with God; but had he
come just then out of wicked company, he had had much
more reason to have done so. The Church Story reports,
that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> (his Scholar) made all the
haste they could out of the <hi>Bath,</hi> when they espyed <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
that Arch-here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick, to be there, as if they feared
infection from the very <hi>water</hi> that mans limbs were washed
in. And concerning that Martyr and Disciple of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn,</hi>
(even now named) we are told, that it was his usuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
to <hi>stop his ears</hi> at the <hi>wicked speeches</hi> of some that
lived in his time. You know who it was, that made a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
of <hi>Chastity</hi> with his <hi>eyes;</hi> and he was a <hi>Wise man</hi>
that wisheth us to make a <hi>vow</hi> of <hi>temperance</hi> with the same
sense; that is, that <hi>we look not on the wine</hi> when it spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
in the Glass. This mans Father fell fouly, by a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious
glance upon <hi>Bathsheba;</hi> and therefore, it is likely
he guarded <hi>that sense</hi> better for the future; and he desires
God, to <hi>Set a watch over his mouth, and keep the door of
his lips,</hi> that he might shut out <hi>Infection</hi> there. We shall
do well to stop up all the avenues and ways by which sin
usually enters; we must not approach so much as the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines</hi>
of Satans Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gdom; we must <hi>abstain from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of evill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes 5. 22.</note> shunning the <hi>occasions</hi> of sin,<note place="margin">Ep. Jud. 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and <hi>hating even
the garment spotted by the flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:109227:11"/>
The third effectuall <hi>Preservative</hi> against the <hi>infection</hi> of
sin, is a <hi>holy confidence, undauntedness, and trusting in
God:</hi> For as we see, that a fearfull fancy and imagination,
melancholly and a dejected spirit, have brought diseases
upon mens bodies; so is it as true, that <hi>fearfullness</hi> and a
<hi>desponding spirit,</hi> have betrayed men to the commission of
sin. Then therefore we consult our own welfare, and the
health of our souls, when we confide and rely upon
God. But this must be done in the way of duty and
Prayer.</p>
            <p>In the next place then, get the <hi>Fire of devotion</hi> to <hi>air
your houses,</hi> to <hi>warm</hi> your <hi>hearts,</hi> to <hi>inflame</hi> your <hi>souls.</hi>
Observe therefore the Connexion of the words prefixed
to this Discourse, [<hi>Which shall know every man the Plague
of his own heart, and spread forth his hands towards this
house.</hi>] While our hands are lifted up in devout Prayer,
our spirituall enemies cannot prevail. Be sure then daily
to use <hi>this perfume, this incense of Prayer;</hi> this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>remedy</hi> against the <hi>Spiritual Plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this belongs <hi>Confession,</hi> and an <hi>humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of our sinfull ways; by this we may <hi>disgorge</hi> our
selves, when our consciences gripe us, and sin makes us
<hi>sick;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 32. 3, 4.</note> by this we cleanse and ease our souls. [<hi>When I
kept silence,</hi> (saith that good King) <hi>my bones waxed old
through my roaring all the day long, my moisture was turned
into the drought of summer.</hi>] These were the sad effects of
his sinfull silence, and hiding of his sin; but the remedy
follows,<note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> [<hi>I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have I not hid.</hi>] Uncover therefore thy folly, and
make thy breast bare before God; as I have seen diseased
Cripples lying in the midst of the streets, opening their
bodies, and shewing their grievous wounds and sores,
and then by hideous lamentations, extorting charity and
pitty from beholders. We read that <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Alass! How many are there, that (with our first
Parents) use <hi>figg leaves</hi> for their <hi>Spiritual sores and
Plagues,</hi> concealing their faults, and hiding them, if it
were possible,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 13.</note> from the eyes of God? But, <hi>He that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
his sin, shall not prosper;</hi> as we see many have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109227:11"/>
of the <hi>Plague,</hi> because they would not <hi>make it
known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Confession</hi> must be accompanied with <hi>grief,</hi> and <hi>sorrow,</hi>
and <hi>hatred</hi> of sin; such a <hi>sorrow</hi> as <hi>pricks</hi> the very
heart: <hi>this</hi> will <hi>break</hi> the <hi>boyl,</hi> and <hi>take down the swelling.</hi>
Beg then a broken and a contrite heart, and the cure is

            <p>And thus having insisted on the Metaphor in the Text,

            </p>
            <p>And the first <hi>Direction</hi> is this, Be sensible of Gods

God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear, seeing our

but God must be acknowledged the author and

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>divine superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency</hi>
in all our calamities, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> speaks
of, and frankly acknowledgeth in all diseases. And
Christians should much more allow of it, looking beyond
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109227:13"/>
               <hi>second causes</hi> to the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> of all. Say not then
that the influence of the starrs and heavenly bodies, or
the late glaring <hi>Comets</hi> which appeared, were the causes
of the <hi>burning feavers</hi> and <hi>malignant distempers,</hi> and even
of this fatall <hi>Pestilence,</hi> which sweeps so many into their
graves; blame not this or that. Indeed as <hi>Philosophers</hi>
and <hi>Naturalists,</hi> you are permitted to search into the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary</hi>
and <hi>physicall</hi> causes of this dreadfull distemper;
but as <hi>Christians</hi> and those that live by <hi>higher principles,</hi>
you are <hi>first</hi> to <hi>look up</hi> unto God, and then <hi>down</hi> into your
selves, and there behold the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> stretched
out against you. God is the great Soveraign of the world,
the wise disposer of the Universe, <hi>who doth what seemeth
good unto him, both in heaven and in earth.</hi> If he shall
please to correct and chastise us, all <hi>naturall</hi> causes shall
give way to his <hi>providence,</hi> which can find us out, though
we labour to run never so far from it. The <hi>Plague</hi> can
climbe over walls, never so high and strongly built; it
can come in at the windows, though they are made never
so fast; it can make it's passage through the doors of the
house, though they are never so closely lockt and bolted.
Labour then to be convinced of this, that there is a <hi>God
that judgeth in the earth,</hi> that you are in his hands, and
that whatever you suffer, is by his disposall. [<hi>I, even I
am he,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 39.</note> and there is no God besides, I kill, and I make alive;
I wound, and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out
of my hand.]<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 6.</note> [The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he
bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up.</hi>] And it is clear
from <hi>Davids Choice,</hi> that the <hi>Pestilence</hi> is more <hi>remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
the Hand of God.<note place="margin">1 Chron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. 12, 13.</note> Let me fall now into the Hand of
the Lord</hi> (saith he) and by <hi>Davids Seer</hi> it is stiled <hi>the
sword of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>present Arrows</hi> of the <hi>Almighty</hi>
are not like that with which <hi>Ahab</hi> was wounded, which
the Story tells us, one shot <hi>at a venture: No, chance</hi> and
<hi>fortune</hi> have nothing to do here. <hi>Apollo</hi> was fitly feigned
by the <hi>Poet</hi> to have sent the <hi>Pestilence</hi> into the <hi>Graecian
Army:</hi> no less then a <hi>God</hi> in their Divinity could do it.
But I pass to</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Direction;</hi> Be more sensible of your <hi>sins</hi>
then of the <hi>punishments</hi> that are upon you; be more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109227:13"/>
of the <hi>Plague</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> then of the <hi>present conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
that raigns in your streets; be much more troubled in
<hi>your souls,</hi> to have <hi>committed a sin</hi> against God, then to
have it <hi>punished by him;</hi> and for the future, choose rather
to undergo any <hi>suffering</hi> from <hi>men,</hi> then to <hi>dishonour
God:</hi> Avoid that which <hi>grieves the Holy Spirit,</hi> rather
then what <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>afflicts</hi> thy <hi>outward man.</hi> How
timorous are we and dejected, at the thoughts of the
<hi>Plagues</hi> approaching near us? We have much more
reason to be <hi>fearfull</hi> of sin which is the <hi>sting</hi> of all <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
We are apt to sit down and bemoan our selves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner: Alas! our condition is very sad, the
place we live in is Infected, we see whole Families drop
away; here Parents are bereaved of their Children, there
the Children survive their Parents, but (alas) are left
shiftless to the wide world: Many houses are shut up,
and onely sickness and death are <hi>Tenants</hi> there. Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are affraid of one another, and it is not <hi>Trading,</hi>
but <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>want</hi> which bring them to the sight of one
another: How many are <hi>buried,</hi> as it were, while they
<hi>live?</hi> and when they are <hi>dead,</hi> they can hardly finde any

complainings are there in our streets? and, if <hi>Gods Hand</hi>
should continue on us longer, it will be hard to tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>scarcity</hi> or the <hi>Sickness</hi> be the worst <hi>Plagues.</hi> After
this sort do we bemoan our selves under Gods judgments;
but where is the man among us, that cryes out of his
<hi>sins,</hi> his <hi>sins?</hi> Where is the <hi>spiritual mourner</hi> that lays
<hi>iniquity</hi> to his <hi>heart,</hi> and feels a thorow remorse upon
his minde for his rebellion against God, for his bidding
defiance to Heaven, and for his abuse of Gods mercies?
Where is the man, that beginning to be sensible of the
<hi>hardness</hi> of his <hi>heart, strikes</hi> upon it, as if he would <hi>break</hi>
it, and <hi>drops down penitentiall tears</hi> that he might soften
it? Such a man is not easily found, such severity on our
selves is not usuall. But know this, that nothing is worth
a tear, a sigh, a groan but <hi>Sin.</hi> Turn therefore your
grief <hi>this way,</hi> and your sorrow for <hi>affliction</hi> will not be so
loud and clamorous. As <hi>Physitians</hi> stop the blood by
<hi>revulsion,</hi> stenching i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vein in <hi>another,</hi> so do you change and divert your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
turn it quite into another channel: <hi>Humble your
selves in the sight of God, lye low before him,</hi> being <hi>cast
down</hi> by the <hi>burden</hi> of <hi>sin:</hi> Be sensible of the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
which is <hi>heavy</hi> upon you, but <hi>chiefly</hi> eye <hi>the finger</hi> that
<hi>points</hi> at thy <hi>Sin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 9. 33.</note> 
               <hi>God is just in all that is brought upon
you, for he hath done right, but you have done wickedly.</hi>
Gods wrath is but a due punishment for your abuse of
his mercy; the overflowing of his anger is but a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for your repeated provocations. Justifie God,
but judg and condemn your selves. Your destruction is
of your selves, your Plagues are the fruit of your own
ways. Had you not been stubborn, and obstinate, and
sinned against mercy, you had not felt such <hi>heavy strokes:</hi>
but because you would not be drawn with <hi>cords of love,</hi>
it was but just, the <hi>cords</hi> should be <hi>twisted into a whip</hi> to
<hi>lash</hi> you into your <hi>duty. Common sicknesses</hi> would not
amend you, you went on and minded not the <hi>ordinary
summons</hi> of <hi>Mortality,</hi> those it seems were not terrible
enough. No wonder then, that God takes another
course, changeth the <hi>rod</hi> into <hi>a Scorpion,</hi> and instead
of the usuall diseases, sends a more <hi>fatall</hi> and <hi>asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
distemper</hi> which carrys <hi>poyson</hi> along with it. You
may thank your selves for all this, for sin was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing

<hi>heals:</hi> and the <hi>Holy man</hi> is well pleased with this sacred or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and method, nay he would have been contented with
the <hi>pardon of sin,</hi> though the <hi>infirmities</hi> of his <hi>body</hi> had still

should be our most ardent request that God would pardon
our sins, subdue our wicked natures, and sanctifie us
with his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and then though the Cross lies heavy on
our bodies and makes our <hi>outward man</hi> decay, yet our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

which this Land is highly guilty of, you are to

And yet I have not named a <hi>brace</hi> of <hi>horrid vices,</hi>
which this Land is to answer for no less then for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;

every sentence with too many men is set off with an oath,
Gods <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious Name</hi> is used and usurped in the

speeches. Gods Name is seldom used by such wretches
in <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>supplication</hi> at the <hi>throne of Grace,</hi> but in
bitter curses and execrations against their brethren it is
daily abused. And is it not just with God to visit <hi>those

well, and besides what I have said, consider also the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

for mourning.</p>
            <p>But then too, if you search and try your <hi>own</hi> ways and

and the <hi>destroying of the accursed thing from amongst us.</hi> For
you must know this, that Praying, and Fasting, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
of our sins, are not the things <hi>ultimatly</hi> designed
in Religion, they are in order to something higher, and
that is <hi>Reformation of our lives. Fasting</hi> is made a duty,
because it may be subservient and instrumental to holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
to our nearer converse with God, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
of our lusts. It was one of <hi>Pythagor as</hi> his <hi>Symbols</hi>

they should be retired, and keep out of <hi>publick offices;</hi>

piety and devotion, and therefore it is to be used to such
an end as that. So likewise for <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Confessing of
our sins,</hi> they are intended to render us more holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
to compose our thoughts, to elevate our souls to
God, and that we may breath out the very secrets of our
hearts before him. 'Tis pity therefore, that <hi>these duties</hi>

praying, and fasting, and seeking of God without <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>

when we <hi>confess</hi> sin and <hi>pray</hi> against it, and yet
<hi>live</hi> in the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of it; we do instead of <hi>averting</hi>
Gods judgments, <hi>pull</hi> them <hi>down</hi> upon us, and continue
them longer amongst us. Be perswaded therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
your lives, and turn unto God in good earnest; do
not onely <hi>pray</hi> but <hi>practice,</hi> as those Mariners who <hi>cryed
every man to his God,</hi> and withall, <hi>cast Ionah over-board.</hi>
Cast out sin, punish sinners, and then <hi>the storm will cease.</hi>
Let every one reform <hi>himself,</hi> and endeavour to reform

way to work a thorow amendment in the <hi>whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
thus the good work will go on apace and come to

            <p>And to promote this <hi>reformation,</hi> let me suggest these
ensuing truths unto you:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Deliverance and mercy is promised to a Nation upon</hi>
this condition <hi>and upon</hi> no other. <hi>Thus runs that answer
of the Lord to</hi> Solomon,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7. 13, 14.</note> [If I shut up heaven that there be
no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if
I send pestilence among my people; If my people which are

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k my face, and turn from their wicked ways: then will
I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will
heal their land.] <hi>Thus likewise you finde it in that word
of the Lord to</hi> Ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>miah,<note place="margin">Jer. 18. 7, 8.</note> [At what instant I shall speak
concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up,
and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that nation against
whom I have pronounced, turn from their evill, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of the evill that I thought to do unto them.] <hi>But</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:109227:17"/>
2. Put the case that the <hi>Plague</hi> be <hi>removed,</hi> and your
<hi>sins still remain;</hi> then I must tell you, that <hi>such a removal
is not a mercy,</hi> for God never <hi>takes away</hi> his <hi>anger</hi> till you
<hi>reform.</hi> He often times indeed leaves a Nation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to themselves and to their own sinfull wills and ways:
But alas! there is no greater <hi>punishment</hi> then <hi>this,</hi> and no
plainer sign of Gods displeasure. It is sad when God
speaks unto a Land as he did of old to <hi>Iudah,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 4, 5.</note> [Ah sinfull

                  </gap> corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord,
they have provoked the holy One of Israel unto anger, they
are gone away backward.</hi>] And then it follows, [<hi>Why
should you be stricken any more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you will revolt more and more,
the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint,</hi> &amp;c.] When
the heaviest <hi>strokes</hi> and <hi>Plagues,</hi> when the greatest judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and calamities will not amend a people, then God
gives them over; as <hi>Physitians,</hi> when their <hi>patients</hi> are
past recovery, permit them any thing.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Punishments removed</hi> and <hi>your sins still remaining,</hi>
do sadly portend a heavyer judgment for the <hi>future,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon your bodies or your souls, either in <hi>this</hi> or the
<hi>other world.</hi> When God took away the <hi>Plagues</hi> from
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he sent <hi>hardness of heart.</hi> Nay, God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the <hi>Plague</hi> and reserve you for <hi>Hell,</hi> and then you
cannot say your case is mended. Thus every ways it is
your interest to <hi>reform</hi> and break off your sins by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

<hi>never felt</hi> the <hi>edge</hi> of it. Here you will do well to make
them experience how <hi>sharp</hi> it is; that <hi>others</hi> too beholding
the punishment inflicted on <hi>them,</hi> may not presume to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

have nothing to live upon these sad times but what they
have laid up before; so let me desire you in <hi>another</hi> and

how <hi>good God</hi> hath been to you, and do not look upon the

            <p>

And as you must <hi>look backward</hi> unto Gods <hi>former mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
so <hi>look forward,</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> for <hi>further afflictions.</hi>
Lay in yet a <hi>larger stock,</hi> thou wilt have need of it <hi>all</hi> when
thou art <hi>sick</hi> and in <hi>sorrow:</hi> Provide then for affliction by
meditating on it <hi>before hand,</hi> make it <hi>now</hi> familiar to thy
thoughts, and so it will be entertained with contentment
when it comes. Ask thy self thus, How should I bear it,
if God should cast me on a bed of sickness? What if I
should go down the wind, if my credit should crack and
my friends fail me? What if God should take all my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enjoyments from me, stripping me naked and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me so into the wide world? I have received <hi>good things</hi>
at Gods hand, how shall I do to receive <hi>evill things?</hi>
Thus by putting <hi>these demands</hi> to thy own soul, and by

it up by little and little, thou bowest thy neck, and fittest
it for the yoak. Oh then fail not to <hi>parly</hi> thus with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>But then remember on the other side, how sad and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
it is to dye in the commission of sin; and are there
not many persons that instead of being employed in Gods
work, are wholly taken up with the Devils, and go out
of the world in that employment? Have you not heard of
some that have <hi>swom</hi> out of the world in <hi>excessive drink,</hi>
they being (in the worst sense of all) <hi>dead drunk?</hi> Was
not <hi>Senacherib</hi> slain when he was worshipping in the house

scared and affrighted are their souls in their entrance into
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109227:24"/>
that other state? This should make all persons, especially
now at this season, to be careful over their ways, that Gods
judgments may not arrest them in the commission of sin,
and so their case be unspeakably forlorn: this should make
us all faithful in our general and particular callings, that
our Lord when he comes may find us doing his will, and
then <hi>in what maner soever</hi> he comes we shall be safe.</p>
            <p>More particularly, to reach thy case, whosoever thou
art that hast or shalt have <hi>the hand of God</hi> upon thy body,
and so art <hi>shut up</hi> and hindred from commerce with the
world, my <hi>Direction</hi> to thee is, that thou converse more
immediatly with <hi>God,</hi> when thou art kept from the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>men.</hi> Thou art <hi>Gods prisoner:</hi> He hath shut thee up,
and though thou art never so closely confined, he can <hi>let
in</hi> his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to thee, and <hi>let out</hi> thy <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt prayers</hi> to
Him. <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> will come and <hi>visit</hi> thee when thou
art <hi>alone,</hi> when lovers and friends s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and aloof off, and thy
nearest relations hide themselves. This is an unspeakable
happiness, that thou hast a God to go to, who is a rock
and place of refuge, who will never fail those that put their
trust in him. When, like <hi>Daniel,</hi> thou art shut up, make
thy prayers to God, spread thy supplications before him,
for thou art not out of Gods hearing. In the want of all
<hi>temporal</hi> enjoyments, seek after those which are <hi>divine</hi> and
<hi>heavenly.</hi> Let the sense and feeling of Gods love to thee,
and the comfortable witness of thy own conscience, make
thee joyful in the midst of all discouragements. Let it not
trouble thee, that thou art separated from thy friends and
acquaintance. It is not long before we must all take leave
one of another, and be <hi>shut up</hi> in our <hi>Coffins.</hi> The enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this world cannot long endure, and therefore dote
not so upon them, as to be utterly dejected when thou
art cut short of them: if thou art imprisoned by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
undergo thy restraint patiently, and do not, like
<hi>children, cry to go abroad.</hi> If thou conversest with God
and thy own heart, thou wilt not be so eager after other
company.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Direction</hi> (but more large) is this, that in this
time of danger you use such means and secondary helps as
Providence hath approved of, but that you do not <hi>trust</hi> in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109227:24"/>
them. We must not be disobedient to Gods order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
what he hath provided we may lawfully make
use of, but then we must beg a <hi>blessing</hi> of God and leave
the success to him. King <hi>Asa</hi> did otherwise and was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for it,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 16. 12.</note> namely, that <hi>when he was diseased he sought not
to the Lord, but to physitians.</hi> Thou mayst repair to the
Physitian, but remember that thou <hi>seekest to God first</hi> and
<hi>beggest</hi> his <hi>blessing chiefly;</hi> for it is only under the conduct
of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> that those <hi>outward means</hi> and <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,</hi>
helps and <hi>medicines</hi> do take effect.</p>
            <p>And so likewise if you have any thoughts of <hi>changing
your place,</hi> and <hi>flying</hi> from the danger, be sure to <hi>take
God along with you.</hi> This the very <hi>Heathens</hi> were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of, who thought themselves safe where ever they
iourneyed, so they carried their <hi>gods</hi> along with them.</p>
            <p>Thus they tell us of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that when <hi>Troy</hi> was on
fire, he was no less mindful of rescuing his <hi>houshold
gods,</hi> then of bringing away his <hi>old d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

back: you must think he reckoned so <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
a <hi>load</hi> as his best <hi>protection,</hi> and that which would
serve to <hi>lighten</hi> his future calamities. And shall I add
what some have conjectured concerning <hi>Rachels</hi> stealing
her Fathers Images, <hi>viz.</hi> That she was somewhat infected
with the Idolatry of <hi>Labans</hi> family, and so being to leave
<hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> she would rather <hi>rob</hi> her <hi>Father</hi> then go
without those little <hi>Moveable</hi> and <hi>Guardian gods.</hi> As for
thee, if thou intendest to shift thy place, forget not to take
the <hi>God of thy fathers</hi> along with thee, even the <hi>great God
of heaven and earth.</hi> Be sure that thou flyest not away from
the Town where Infection is, that thou mayst sin <hi>more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely</hi>
in another place: remember God sees thee, and
can send his <hi>flying arrows</hi> after thee, though thou doest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
thy self never so closely. Rather make thy peace
with God, and get the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Lamb of God
sprinkl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

over</hi> thee: where ever thou art make the <hi>most High</hi> thy
confidence,<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 3, 4.</note> so thou shalt be best secured. [<hi>Thou wilt
keep him in perfect peace whose minde is stayed on thee, because
he trusted in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever, for in the
Lord Iehovah is everlasting strength.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:109227:25"/>
But though thou art <hi>free thy self,</hi> by Gods great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

of the <hi>Royall Preacher</hi> is more especially directed to

be <hi>girt about,</hi> and <hi>your lights burning,</hi> as servants atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Master's business, ready to do any thing that he
shall enjoyn them. Now you had need <hi>exhort one another

after the concerns of your <hi>own souls,</hi> and do what you
can by sober advice and councel, by exhortation and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
reproof, by a holy and exemplary life to make your
neighbours better.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>What maner of persons ought you to be
in all holy conversation and Godlinesse?</hi> Let me under this
<hi>Direction</hi> leave with you but these <hi>four</hi> words, which are
the abridgment of what I have said already;</p>
            <p>1. Converse with God more vigorously then ever,
<hi>unite your forces,</hi> and <hi>wrestle strongly</hi> with Him, till you
prevail for <hi>your selves,</hi> for this <hi>sinful land,</hi> for this <hi>distressed
Town.</hi> 2. Disingage your affections more resolvedly
from the world: you see the vanity of it daily, you have
fresh experiences of the uncertainty of all creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts;
let your hearts be taken off from them even whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
you do possess them, and be ready to <hi>part</hi> with them.
3. Act <hi>Faith</hi> more strongly, and trust on <hi>God</hi> when the
<hi>world</hi> fails you. 4. Walk more warily and strictly in
your lives, throw not away your time so vainly as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be more sober and watchful, minding the welfare of
your <hi>own souls,</hi> and calling upon <hi>others</hi> to serve God and
credit the Christian Religion by a holy life. Act to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of your power in the place God hath set you,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 9.</note> 
               <hi>be not
weary in well doing, for in due season you shall reap if you
faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, to draw to a conclusion, when it shall please
God in much mercy to remove the present <hi>Plague</hi> and
judgment from this Town, remember that you faithfully
keep those vows and promises which you made unto God in
the day of your fears and distresses,<note place="margin">Psal 50. 15.</note> [<hi>Call upon me</hi> (saith

ate taken out of the <hi>Furnace of affliction,</hi> do not return to
your former <hi>hardness</hi> and <hi>inflexibleness.</hi> If you have laid
aside your sins in your affliction, do not afterwards take
them up again when the affliction is removed. Do not as
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, who cryed out to have the <hi>Plagues</hi> taken
away, and withal acknowledged his sin, and asked forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and made large promises of amendment; but when his
request was granted, he hardned his heart, and returned to
his former wickedness. 'Twas a bad requital <hi>Noah</hi> made
for his escaping the <hi>flood,</hi> to be <hi>drowned</hi> afterwards in <hi>wine.</hi>
'Twill be sad for thee, if thy <hi>resolutions</hi> of <hi>living well</hi> end at
last in <hi>forgetfulness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>dishonouring of his Name</hi> by

and cordial in thy purposes, and if (with <hi>Hezekiah)</hi>
thou hast <hi>years added to thy life,</hi> add likewise to thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
