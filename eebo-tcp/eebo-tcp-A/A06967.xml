            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27862:6"/>
this famous Art taketh its deriuation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that is to say.</p>
               <p>First, the Carriage and vse of Armes, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in diuers <hi>Postures</hi> or <hi>Stations,</hi> expressing the Forme, Comlinesse and Readinesse of Men in Armes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Distance</hi> or Seperation of place, whereby Battayles are formed, changed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, according to the will and pleasure of the principall Commanders.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, March and Motion, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from certaine peculiar words of Command, and generall direction, the Soldier applieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to performe euery command in the fullnesse of perfection.</p>
               <p>And Fourthly and lastly, the knowledge of the Beatings of the <hi>Drumbe,</hi> by which the Soldier taketh notice of euery Command, when the sound of Mans voice is drowned or obscured.</p>
               <p>It now seemeth good vnto me (and I hope it will yeeld a generall profite to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) to fixe vnto the aforesayd <hi>Accidence</hi> a <hi>Grammar</hi> or Introductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> into more higher, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and more subtile and curious Rules of the Art <hi>Mylitary,</hi> whereby the younger Schollers may be enabled to proceed and goe forward in the greater and more hidden secrets of the Arte, and the elder or better experienced Men of Warre, may eyther finde Solutions for such doubtes as shall incumber them; Or else matter whereon to worke, and make their owne more singular Inuentions and Applications more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27862:6"/>
wholesome for the common vse, and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to their owne Studies and Labours.</p>
               <p>The first thing therefore which I hold most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Intreate of in this <hi>Grammar,</hi> is of <hi>Great Motions in generall</hi>; Because according to the Opinion of the Auncients, <hi>These Military Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the Life of an Armie, and only giue meanes of Victorie; and without which, all preparation of Forces are vaine, and auaileth nothing in the Field, nor to the end for which they were Leuied.</hi> Since then, Motion is of this inestimable reputation, the labor cannot be misimployed, which bringeth any luster or explanation vnto the same.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Smaller Motions,</hi> I haue spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what already in the <hi>Accidence</hi>; As of <hi>Fileing, Rancking, Returning to the first Posture, Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marching, Doubling,</hi> and such like, so far foorth as they appertayne to euery single Person, or to the parts and members of a priuate Companie, which we call <hi>Squadrons</hi> or <hi>Camerados.</hi> But now I am to intreat of the <hi>Greater Motions,</hi> which belong to <hi>Regiments, Battalias,</hi> and the whole Bodie of an <hi>Armie:</hi> Neyther in the discourse of these things, are you to expect much alteration of wordes, or sence, but only the application of them vnto the Greater and more infinite Bodies, from whence they take the denomination of the <hi>Greater Motions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gretians</hi> (as <hi>Aelian</hi> and his Schollars) doe reckon vp nineteene seuerall <hi>Great Motions,</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Distances.</note>Of Fyles and Rankes, what they are, what their extents ought to be, what effects, vertues, and vses are wrought by them, I haue sufficiently shewed in my <hi>Accidence:</hi> Only, because there is a little difference betwixt vs and the Auncients, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Schollers of these Moderne times, and the Schollers of the Elder World, I will as neere
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27862:9"/>
as I can, reconcile them, or at least, bring them to shake hands, and agree together.</p>
               <p>The first Receiuers of Millitarie Discipline (and those which are at this day their Schollers, and profest Imitators) would haue a File to consist of Sixeteene Men in depth, successiuely one after an other: Others would haue it consist of Eight; And others (which are our latest and best appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) would haue them consist of Ten.</p>
               <p>The reason why the first would haue it consist of sixteene,<note place="margin">The Ancient and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Author reconcil'd.</note> is because it is an euen and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable number, which may bee doubled to the last man; as from sixteene to eight, from eight to foure, from foure to two, from two to one; and so backe againe reduced to the first forme or Station. This I confesse beares a faire shew of much probability, and was doubtlesse in the first Age, of singular vse and benefit, both for the forming and proportioning of Battailes; as also for the readinesse of Marching, and the mixing or ioyning of many Grosses, or great Bodies, in one square, Round or Triangular fashion. But it is to be vnderstood, that in these former dayes, there was no vse or knowledge of Shot, because the inuention of Fire lay then vnknowne; their Darts, Slings, Crosse-bowes, Long-bowes, and the like, which passed vnder the Light-armed, held then no method or prescript forme in giuing their Volleis, but deliuered them one ouer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others head, without danger: so that the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the File was, the greater the Volley was, and the Enemy the more indangered; besides
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27862:10"/>
the drawing and nocking of the Arrow, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Sling, the bending of the Crosse-bow, and the charging of the Dart, are Motions so soddaine, so quicke, and so secure, that there is no necessity of alteration of place; for in as much as not any of these Volleis are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vpon the Leuell, but vpon necessity on the Mounture; therefore the forestanders, or leaders of Files, and their followers are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by the Reare: so that in this case, the deeper the File is, the more hands are brought to fight, and the victory the sooner obtained.</p>
               <p>But with vs now in these moderne and latter times, wherein the Inuention of Shott and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is founde out; and the danger, Sodainnesse and Violence of the Fire is knowne: in so much that it is euer deliuered in Leuell, seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at Random (for that is vselesse and to no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant purpose). In this case there is great respect to be had to the alteration and change of place, for (as I haue sayd before) to deliuer Short one behinde another (and that also in Leuell) is for the hindmost to Kill the formost, if they Shoot in Leuell (as they ought) or otherwise Shooting at Randome, to spende their Bulletts to no purpose and leaue the Enemie vnauoided; Therefore in this true and certayne Discipline, Fier is onlye to be giuen in the Front, and so by succession of Ranks, one Volley after another, euery hand is in his due time and place brought to Fight, and the Volley hath no intermission or respeit.</p>
               <p>Now it is to bee considered in what space of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27862:10"/>
time a man may Charge and Discharge his Peece mouing from the Front to the Reare, and so As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sending vp to the Front againe; and it is found by the experience of all well Iudging Souldiers, that the depth of Tenn men is the absolute best Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, For the first man Discharging in the Front, in the space that nine more shall come and doe the like: The first shall make his place good againe, &amp; so continnue the Volley <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Now there are some which strongly hold opinion, that Eight in depth of File shall doe as much as ten, and with as litle Difficultie make readie and Present; which no question, may be possible, in expert, old, and readie Soldiers and so a competent and sufficient File; But in raw, Ignorant, and half exercised men it cannot be so, Neither can it be hoped that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shall so sudainly be performed, And if there be losse of dutie in one man, there will be losse of duty in more, and so the Volley will be weakned &amp; the <hi>Battalia</hi> put in danger; To add a man and make the File nine, is no good Extent, because that odd Number comming to be doubled, there will be a weaknesse either in the Front, or in the Reare; And that wekenesse may ouerthrow the whole <hi>Battalia</hi>; So that for a conclusion of this point, I cannot but disallowe Sixteene in File as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to great a Number, in which no lesse then Six men are lost in euery File so oft as they shall Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vp or make their aproaches, eight I feare is two men to litle, the Skill and Dexteritie of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being doubtfull; and Nine, for the odds may not be admitted, So that it resteth that Tenn men
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27862:11"/>
in File is the olde cettaine, and alowable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I doe not denie but that in Exercising of the Souldiers, the Number Eight is very alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and will bring them to a great quicknesse and readinesse, but when they shall be brought to to fight, and mixe with other Regiments; Then you are to obserue the generall forme of the Armie, and what Extent of File the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Marcheth in, the same Number and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you shall keepe in your priuat Companie, Which questionlesse at this day is the Number Tenn, and no other: both for the fittnesse of the Number in Discharging Dutie, as also in that by the Number Tenn, Euery Hundred Men make a perfect Square, and so are the soonest and with the least trouble drawne into any Forme of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile that the prncipall Commander can desire.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue shewed you the trne Extent of a File,<note place="margin">The ground of all <hi>Motions.</hi>
                  </note> and the Impediments which hang vpon the alteration of Opinions; wherein you are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that in all Millitarie Motions there must be euer a certaine and Infallible grounde whereon to Builde the greater workes; For where euerie thing is vncertaine there all things must needes be Confused, Now in the Artt of Warr, Rankes are vncertaine, and doe consiste of Numbers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge to pleasure? Companies are Imperfect, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationed by imployment, Sicknesse, Death, or other Dissasters: Regiments are more or lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the goodnesse, or badnesse of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, only the File is certaine and without Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, So that from that Ground, euerie good
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27862:11"/>
and great Commander (vpon the first view) can tell howe to shape and proportion any Battaile whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>This being then the concluding <hi>Maxime</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the true Extent,<note place="margin">The drawing of Grosses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order.</note> and Quantitie of a File, which is the Grounde or Foundation where vpon all great Battailes are Built. We will now proceede to the seuerall Motions belonging to the Foote Companies, of which the first and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncipall, is the drauing of Rude, and Indigested Grosses, into a faire, orderlie, and well proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Bodie; and this must not in anie wise be done by Rankinge, and Drawinge forthe of Rankes, for that is rude, and vn-souldier like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Ranks haue no certainty, nor hold any cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Number: So that no man taking a rude heape of confused men (which number he knoweth not) can tell how many Rankes they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and keepe the Files certaine: therefore to put these men in Order, it must be done by Filing, and not Ranking; euery File of one and the same Weapon, being drawne out File after File, and then ioyned and formed into one grosse Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to the pleasure of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. And in this drawing vp of Bodies, is to bee considered the composition, or parts, whereof euery File must consist; that is to say, the principall and first man of euery File, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Leader, or Captaine of the File, hee leadeth; then followeth him three of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degree; the first man is called the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle man to the Reare, or a Leader of halfe files
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27862:12"/>
to the Reare; the sixth man is called the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-man to the <hi>Front,</hi> or leader of the halfe file to the <hi>Front</hi>; then after them, three other inferiour followers; and lastly, the Reare, or Bringer vp: So that euery File consisteth of foure men of eminence and desert, as the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Bringer vp,<note place="margin">Of single Files.</note> the Middle-man to the Front, and the Middle-man to the Reare, and sixe inferiour followers or attendants, as by this example you shall see more plainely.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:27862:12"/>The next Motion after the drawing vp of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Numbers into an vniforme,<note place="margin">Of closing and opening.</note> is the closing and opening of Fyles or Rankes, or both Fyles and Rankes at one instant; And in this Motion, is to be obserued, true Distance, or seperation of Place, according to the will of the Commander, because it is a Motion that only consisteth in distance.</p>
               <p>The next, is a Motion in Forme, and that also consisteth of Fyles or Rankes seuerally, or of both Fyles and Rankes ioyntly, in one instant; And this is doubling of Fyles, or Rankes: If doubling of Fyles? it is according to this example.</p>

               </p>
               <p>These Fyles being eight in Number, are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to the Right Hand,<note place="margin">The manner of performing the <hi>Motion.</hi>
                  </note> the outermost or corner Man of the Rght Hand standing still, and making good both his owne Place, and all the rest of his Fyle, and the next Man on his Left Hand passing behind him, and so successiuely the whole second Fyle passing (as the first) behind the first Fyle, the fourth Fyle behind the third Fyle, the sixth behind the fifth, &amp; the eight behind the seuenth;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27862:13"/>
and so they stand doubled, as in the Example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed; where eight Fyles are brought into foure, and the depth of ten brought into the depth of twentie: And in this doubling, is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by those which remooue and passe behind the other, that if it be to the Right Hand, then he is first to come about round with his Left Foote, then step forward with his Right Foote behind his Leader that must be, and then bring on his Left Foote, and place his Body euen; so that by these three Motions, the action shall be performed in perfection: And thus as you double Fyles to the Right Hand, so you may also double them to the Left Hand, vsing euerie Motion in a contrary manner; that is to say, where the Right hand Man did before stand firme, and the Left hand Man did moue; now the Left hand Man must stand firme, and the Right hand Man must remoue; and as before, the Left foote did first come about, so now the Right foote must, and when they shall be reduced back againe to their first Place or Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then it is to be obserued, that they must in three Stepps or Motions, recouer their former Places, remouing first the Left foote, if the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were to the Right hand, and the Right foote, if the double were made to the Left hand.</p>
               <p>The next Motion,<note place="margin">Aduancing of Files.</note> being also a Motion in Forme, is the aduancing of Fyles, which is also a doubling, though after another manner: For in this aduancing of Fyles (if it be to the Right hand) then the Right hand File standeth still, and the Leader of the next file vnto it, doth advance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27862:14"/>
the Right hand file, and his whole file fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him in true order and distance, they all aduance, till the Bringer vp, or Reare Man, stand iust before the Leader of the Right hand file, which standeth still, and moueth not; then the fourth file aduanceth before the third, the sixth before the fifth, and the eight before the seauenth, and so forth, till euery other file haue aduanced in the whole <hi>Battalia</hi>: And in like manner, if the Aduancement be made to the Left hand, then those which stood still, when the Aduancement was to the Right hand shall moue, and they which did moue shall now stand still, as by these Examples doth more plainely apeare.</p>
               <figure>

               </p>
               <p>Thus you see how Fyles are to be Aduanced, eyther to the Right hand, or to the Left, wherein is to be obserued; that howsoeuer I speake of files to be aduanced distinctly, one after another; yet the Motion is to be don entirely, of one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing file at one instant: And thus, if you please, you may Aduance so oft, that you may bring a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27862:15"/>
whole <hi>Battalia</hi> into one single file.<note place="margin">Reducing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to their first forme.</note> Now for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them into their first forme or body againe, the Word (<hi>As you were</hi>) being giuen, euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing file that did Aduance, shall turne Faces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and so march back to their first places; and as thus, you aduance eyther to the Right or Left hand at one instant; So you may also at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant aduance both to the Right and Left hand by deuision, making the second file aduance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first, the fourth before the third, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth before the eight, the fyfth before the sixth: And as thus in aduancing, so also in doubling of files, as you double to the Right or Left hand; so you may double to both the Right and Left hand at one instant by deuision, the second file passing behind the first, the fourth behind the third, then the seuenth behind the eight, and the fifth behind the sixth.</p>
               <p>Now here by the way there may a scruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, that for as much as numbers may vary, and that all bodies hold not one euen or iust content or Number; that then in case there be an odd file, how then shall the bodie be doubled? To this I answere, that if you happen to haue an odde file, then looke to what hand you double vnto, then the outmost file to the contrary hand shall stand and keepe his place firme, without doubling at all; as if you double to the Right hand, then the Left hand file stands fast and vndoubled; or if you double to the Left hand, then the Right hand file stands fast and vndoubled, as by these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples plainely apeareth.</p>
               <p>

begin and conduct in this orderly manner; so shall all the rest of euery File, obseruing true Place and Distance, follow with as great care and seuerity, euery Man obseruing his Leader and his Right hand Man, and that by no meanes they offer to turne, till they haue made good the first place, where the Fyle Leaders did turne, and so keeping their Rankes euen and iust, the Motion will be exceeding comely, as by this Example apeareth.</p>

               <p>The manner of this Nation is thus, the first Ranke or Leaders of the Files of Shot, doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and giue fire, then stand; and the second Ranke passing either to the right or left Hand (according to commandement) aduance before the first Ranke, couering them both in order and distance; then the third Ranke aduanceth and couereth the second; the fourth, the third; and so foorth in an orderly charge, till the Bringer vp or Reare be brought and made the Front; and so as occasion shall serue to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue still, till the ende of Commandment. Now for the Pikes or short Weapons, they shall not need to aduance one Ranke before another, but shall keepe their constant March (with their Pykes aduanced, ported, or shouldered) euen still with the first Ranke of Shot, till they come to encounter and charge the Enemy, and then at pleasure, and as occasion shall serue, they may couer one another, and bring euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall hand to the pushe, till the last be first, and the first last, as by this Example doth plainely appeare.</p>

then the whole wing is as it was at the first, 1.2.3 now as thus you may cast off the files to both Hands, making the file 10. to stand, and the Volley giuen to retreate betweene the file 8. and the file 7. then the file 9. to stand, and the Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley giuen to retreate betweene the file 7. and the file 10. then the file 8. to stand, and the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley giuen, to retreat betweene the file 7. and the file 9. So then the body is brought againe to his first forme, 8.9.10.</p>
               <p>Now for the casting of Files in Wing, you must draw foorth the File 1. on the right hand, and the file 10. on the left hand in the manner of Wings, and hauing giuen their Volley, shall stand still till the reare bee aduanced, and then the file 1. shall retreat betweene the file 4. and the file 3. and the file 10. shall retreat between the file 7. and the file 8. as in the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and so the rest of the files one after another, this example appeareth.</p>

               <p>Thus you see the Contents and forme of a <hi>Horse</hi> file, from which certainty, and true knowne Ground, euery skilfull Commander may builde vp any Bodie that he pleaseth; whereas, if both Ranke and Fyle should be incertaine, and at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, there would then be no Ground for any thing, but euerything would be confused, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the phantast quenesse of Opinion.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27862:27"/>
to command the Men to Ranke three, fiue, seuen, or as fancie leades them, for this is most absurde, and vnproper, because Rankes are, and may be of vncertaine Number; so that ranking at hap ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, it is almost impossible that the files should fall out euen, whose Number must not be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and so a new worke to begin, which at the first might better haue bene finished.</p>
               <p>But to my purpose againe; When you haue drawne vp the Bodie of the <hi>Horse</hi> in true Files and Rankes, and hauing euerie Officers readie for his due Place, as <hi>Captaine, Liuetenant, Cornet, Trumpets</hi> and <hi>Corporalls:</hi> You shall then (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Figure or Example following in the next Page) Troope into the Field, eyther for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, or other Exercise.</p>

               <p>Thus you haue seen the maner of Trooping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Field, with al the Officers of a priuat troop, and how they are deuided into foure Deuisions.

                  <hi>Corporall</hi>; the Reare or hindmost being brought vp by the <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> the two yongest <hi>Corporalls</hi> are extrauagant, and ride vp and downe on both sides, to see the whole Body keepe their true Order.

               <p>Now for the drawing of this Troope into a firme Body, for Seruice, or Exercise, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hauing found conuenient ground, maketh a stand with his Deuision; and the Cornet bringeth vp his Deuision, on the left Hand the Captaines, placing himselfe vpon the left File of his owne Deuision; then the eldest Corporall bringeth vp his Deuision on the left hand the Cornet, and as soone as they are ioyned, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth himselfe to the outside of the right Wing, to see that true Order and Distance bee kept; then the second Corporall bringeth vp his Deuision on the left Hand the eldest Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, and himselfe departeth to the outside of the left Wing, to see that true Order and Distance be kept; For now all Corporalls are extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; and all the Trumpets ascend to the head and Troope next behinde the Captaine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cornet; the eldest Trumpet taking the right hand, and so the rest according to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>

               <p>There is another forme of Imbattailing the Horse, which is called the <hi>Horsemans-Wedge,</hi> and it is drawne vp into the forme of this Figure, or Example following.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There is an other <hi>Battalia</hi> of Horse, which is called the <hi>Rhombe</hi> of Horse, and it is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to this Figure, and is of great vse, hauing in euery corner a Leader.</p>

               <p>This Horsmans <hi>Rhombe</hi> was first found out in <hi>Thessalia,</hi> and thence brought in great practise, through the benefite thereof, being able to passe through, and to peirce any Foote battaile what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer; and is only to be opposed, by that Foote

                  <hi>Battalia</hi> which is called <hi>Menoides</hi> or <hi>Cressent,</hi> and in forme of an Halfe Moone, whose Winges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stretched out by the Leaders, the middle part is imbowed, and bent to inuyron and wrappe in the Horse Men as they Charge, and so put them to Route and Disorder, and therefore in this case are to keepe aloofe off, and not to come in, but to plye their Pistolls, till they see the Foote Battaile stagger, and fall into disorder:</p>

               <p>There is no Foote Battaile more excellent to oppose, then as that which is called of the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Epicampios, Emprosthia,</hi> which as the Halfe Moone carrieth a circular hollownesse, so this carrieth a square hollownesse, as you may see in this Figure.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:27862:31"/>The end or purpose, to which this foote Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile is framed, is to beguile and ouerreach the <hi>Pistoleirs,</hi> eyther by inticing them into the voyd or emptic place of the <hi>Battalia,</hi> as they Charge in furie, and vpon the Spurre, or else, by disordering their Horses with their Winges, and so driue them into an vtter confusion.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Battalia</hi> makes shew but of a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, because the Deuisions lie hid and couered, and so much apter to be mistaken; for, the Winges which are the least number, are only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the eye, the Bodie (which is three times more) is hardly discerned; so that if the Winges preuaile, the Conquest is sure; if they faile, they may easily retire into the maine Bodie, and make a powerfull resistance.</p>
               <p>There is another Horse Battaile, which is square in Figure, but not in Horse, being eleuen in Ranke, and but sixe in file, which is called of the Auntients a <hi>Tetragonall</hi> Horse Battaile; this is a very strong Battaile, as all square Battailes are, and our Fore fathers did affect it much, and we at this day finde it of great vse for our <hi>Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leirs,</hi> both for the strength, and the ready fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereof, there is no Battaile on foote to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, but that which is called <hi>Embolos,</hi> or the <hi>Wedge</hi> of Foore, which is framed of Foote Men, as the former Wedge was made of Horse Men, all the outsides consisting of Armed Pikes, and the Lynings within of Shotte: Also the front of this Foote <hi>Wedge,</hi> consisteth of three Armed Pikes, as the Horse <hi>Wedge</hi> did consist of one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

Armed <hi>Pistolier.</hi> Many other Motions and Imbattaylings of Horse there be, but none more vsefull then these already expressed; and he that is able to draw Horse and Man, into these formes and figures all readie expressed, may without any difficultie or amazement, draw vp any other Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile at the first sight, be the Inuention neuer so deepe, obscure, and curious.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27862:32"/>
them to Termes of greater familiarity, and much lesse trouble and vexation to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: Yet because I know that Noueltie is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto many; some, desirous to know what they neuer intend to practise; others, willing to satisfie their mindes, least Questions of this nature might be vnseasonably brought vpon them; and others, for Argument sake, to fill vp Discourse, with those Knowledges which they imagine are obscured to others: For these Reasons, I thinke it not amisse, to shew how the Auntients did Range their Battailes, and what Names they gaue to their seuerall Numbers; and then, to shew our owne manner of Range, and the easy apprehension thereof, that being compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Iudgement may soone finde out, which is most auaileable.</p>
               <p>And heerein, you must first vnderstand, that the Auntients did range their <hi>Battailes</hi> into Files, euery single file contayning in depth or number, full sixteene Men, and so called a <hi>File</hi>; a Bodie compounded of two files, they termed a <hi>Dilochie,</hi> of two and thirty Men, and the Leader, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of those two and thirty Men, was called <hi>Dilochita</hi>; foure files, contayning threescore and foure Men, they called a <hi>Tetrarchy,</hi> and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or Leader thereof <hi>Tetrarcha</hi>; eight files, a <hi>Taxis,</hi> and the Captaine <hi>Taxiarcha</hi>; then is six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene files, a <hi>Syntagma,</hi> and the Captaine thereof <hi>Syntagmatarcha,</hi> which indeed, is that Man which we call a Captaine in Chiefe, for euery <hi>Syntag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matarcha</hi> had vnder him, fiue Inferior Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27862:32"/>
that is to say, a <hi>Reare</hi> Commander, which we call a <hi>Liuetenant,</hi> an <hi>Ensigne,</hi> a <hi>Trumpeter,</hi> which in our foote Companies is the <hi>Drumbe,</hi> a <hi>Sergeant,</hi> and a <hi>Cryer,</hi> which we call a <hi>Corporall:</hi> Now two and thirty files (which is two <hi>Syntag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>) they call a <hi>Pentecosiarchy,</hi> and contayneth fiue hundred and twelue Men, which with vs is called a <hi>Colonie</hi> or <hi>Regiment,</hi> and the Captaine thereof is called <hi>Pentecosiarcha,</hi> which we call a <hi>Colonell,</hi> now two of these <hi>Pentecosiarchies</hi> being a thousand and twenty foure Men; and three score and foure files, they call a <hi>Chiliarchy,</hi> and the Captaine thereof <hi>Chiliarcha,</hi> which indeed we call a <hi>Colonell</hi> Generall; two <hi>Chiliarchies</hi> amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to two thousand and forty eight Men, they call a <hi>Merarchy,</hi> being a hundred and twenty eight files, and the Captaine <hi>Merarcha,</hi> which is with vs the <hi>Sergeant Maior</hi> Generall; two <hi>Merarchies</hi> they call a <hi>Phalangarchy,</hi> and the Captaine <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langarcha,</hi> which is as much as the <hi>Master</hi> of our <hi>Ordnance</hi>; two <hi>Phalangarchyes</hi> they call a <hi>Dipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langarchy,</hi> and the Captaine <hi>Diphalangarcha,</hi> which is with vs as <hi>Liuetenant</hi> Generall; and two <hi>Diphalangarchies</hi> make a foure fold Battaile of <hi>Phalange,</hi> consisting of a thousand and twenty foure files, and sixteene thousand three hundred and eighty foure Men, whose Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is the King, or his Generall.</p>
               <p>Thus you haue the Range of a Foote Battaile, according to the Custome of the Auncients, from the first file (which is the lowest) to the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a Maine Battaile. It now resteth that I

shew you our Moderne or late manner of Range, by which all our Battailes are Compounded, Gouerned, and Conducted; and in this Discrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I must varry much from the Auntients, and begin a steppe lower in degree; but two stepps (at least) lower in number. And here I must haue you first remember, that as the Auntients began with whole files of 16. in number, so I must now begin with halfe files, being but fiue in number; for in this Range (of which now I write) no file must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the number of 10. fiue then, which is the Roote or beginning of this Range, is called halfe a file, or halfe a <hi>Decurio,</hi> and the Leader or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereof is called <hi>Lanspesado,</hi> or <hi>Middle</hi> Man; Two halfe files make a whole file of ten, and the Leader or Captaine thereof is called <hi>Decurio,</hi> or the <hi>File</hi> Leader.</p>

               <p>Thus you haue seene the true Range of Foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their Leaders, according to their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: It now resteth, that I shew you the true Range of their Weapons.</p>
               <p>In the Auntient Times the <hi>Light Armed</hi> (which were <hi>Bowmen, Darters,</hi> and <hi>Slingers</hi>) had the <hi>Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,</hi> and were the first beginners of Fight and Skyrmish, for by their Darts and Arrowes, they prouoked the Enemie to breake their Rankes, and ouerthrew and killed many in their approaches, they galled and repulsed the Horse much, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, were euer the first Authors of Victorie; and as thus they sometimes placed them in the Front, so at other times, they had their places in the Flankes, and sometimes in the Reare; But the generall and most certaine Range which they held, was euer betwene the Armed Pikes: The first file of the Light Armed, behinde the first file of the Armed; the second file of the Light Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, behind the second file of the Armed; and so consequently, to leuie all the Armed Menne through the whole <hi>Batttalia</hi>; yet the file of the Light Armed, shall be but halfe the number of the Armed; and these Battailes shall be drawne into diuers Deuisions.</p>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:27862:34"/>But this Range of Weapons agreeth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Discipline at this day, for our Battailes consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting only of armed Pikes, Muskatiers, and a fewe short weapons, they are raunged in this manner, when they march into the Field, they march Company after Company single of themselues without any mixture: and in this march of single Companies, the Muskatiers are deuided into two parts; the one part hath the Vanguard, the other hath the Reare, and the Pikes march in the midst; vpon the head whereof is the <hi>Ensigne,</hi> and about it the short weapons, as Halberd, Partizans, or the like, (if the Company haue any) when they are come into the Field, then is euery Regiment drawn vp into a Body by it selfe, whereof all the Pikes are drawne into an entire body by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and the Shott deuided into two Bodies, whereof one halfe Wingeth vp the right Hand of the Pikes, and the other halfe wingeth vp the left hand of the Pikes. The <hi>Ensignes</hi> stand still on the head, or within a Ranke, and the short weapons of execution about them for guard.</p>
               <p>These Regiments are drawne into the Battaile, according to the pleasure of the Lord <hi>Marshall,</hi> or <hi>Serieant Maior</hi> Generall. The Horsemen are the Wings which troope on each side of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, keeping the distance of halfe a Furlong at least from either side of the Shot. The great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, or Artilery are drawne from the two out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most poynts of the Battaile, a pretty distance from the Vantguard, and extend themselues wider and and wider fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Battaile, being drawe at length

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Horse-Troopes in the Ancient and first times had no one certaine Range, or place in the Battaile, but according to the humors and opinions of their <hi>Generals,</hi> so they were altered and carried vp and downe to seueral places of Commandment. <hi>Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> saith, that in some Battailes within his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie and knowledge, the Horse Troopes were Ranged after the light Armed, yet doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly stand vpon the allowance of that Range; but saith, that although they were ranged after the Light-armed, yet other places might be more conuenient, and this range might be altered at the pleasure of the <hi>General,</hi> or vpon any necessary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, where Victories stood doubtfull: others of the Ancients, as at sometimes the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> now and then the <hi>Romans,</hi> but many times the <hi>Thebans</hi> &amp; <hi>Thessalians</hi> haue ranged their Troops of Horse in the Reare of the armed Battailes, and good successe hath many times issued thereof, &amp; the Rangers of such Battailes haue returned Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27862:35"/>
Others of the Auntients, and especially <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> himselfe, <hi>Craterus,</hi> and most of the worthiest <hi>Macedonians,</hi> haue ranged their Horse Battailes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right and left Winges of the maine Armie; and indeed, these Places are most probable and best agreeing with our present Discipline.</p>
               <p>To come then to the Range of the Horse Battaile, as it is vsed at this day, you must vnderstand, that it varyeth foure seuerall waies; two in the Range of the <hi>Curaseires,</hi> two in the Range of the <hi>Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seires</hi> or <hi>Dragoones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Curaseires</hi> haue two seuerall Ranges, the one in ordinary trooping, the other in a formed <hi>Battaile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In an ordinary <hi>Troope</hi> where the whole Battaile mooueth, the first day, the <hi>Troope</hi> and <hi>Regiment</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Generall,</hi> troopeth formost, and hath the leading of the Poynt; After him, troopeth the <hi>Troope</hi> and <hi>Regiment</hi> of the Lord <hi>Marshall</hi>; and after him, euery <hi>Colonell,</hi> and his <hi>Regiment,</hi> according to his Antiquitie: The next day, the Lord <hi>Marshall,</hi> and his <hi>Regiment,</hi> hath the leading of the Poynt or <hi>Vauntguard,</hi> and the <hi>Generall</hi> hath the <hi>Reare</hi>; the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <hi>Colonell</hi> succeedeth the Lord <hi>Marshall,</hi> and so the rest of the <hi>Colonells,</hi> and their <hi>Regiments</hi> after him, according to Antiquitie: The third day, the Eldest <hi>Colonell</hi> hath the Poynt or <hi>Vantguard,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Marshall</hi> hath the <hi>Reare</hi> after the <hi>Generall</hi>; and thus alternately euery <hi>Colonell</hi> shall change his Place, &amp; haue the leading of the Poynt or <hi>Vauntguard,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the seuerall daies of trooping (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no intermission or stay of many daies betweene the seuerall remooues: And as thus the Chiefe and Superior Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>manders doe remooue and alter their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27862:36"/>
Places, so shall the Inferior Commanders of euerie <hi>Regiment</hi> doe the like; the <hi>Colonell</hi> hauing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall place the first day, the <hi>Liuetenant Colonell</hi> the second day, the <hi>Sergeant Maior</hi> the third day; and so euery Captaine after, according to his Antiquitie; in which order, no Commander looseth Dignitie, but hath his seuerall day of Glory, and as much prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence as the <hi>Generall,</hi> or any other Commander, whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Now if it come to a formed Battaile, then the Ranges change, and the <hi>Regiments</hi> are drawne vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one whole and entire Bodie, in which drawing vp of <hi>Regiments,</hi> this order is to be obserued, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery perticular Troope shall duely keepe their two distances, that is to say, <hi>Open Order</hi> in their Rankes, and <hi>Close Order</hi> in their Files, then betwixt Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Company, in euery Regiment, shall be the space of 25. foote, that thereby they may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter distinguished, and the sooner drawne foorth, and imployed in any needefull place, as the Superior Commanders shall thinke good.</p>
               <p>This Order and Distance being obserued, <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are to be brought into maine Bodies, eyther Square, Long, Tryangular, or Dyamond, according to the nature of the ground, and the fashion of the Enemies Battaile, for therein is the aduantage.</p>
               <p>Now for the true Range, the <hi>Generall</hi> hath euer the <hi>Vauntguard,</hi> which is the right Wing of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and the Lord <hi>Marshall</hi> hath the second <hi>Vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,</hi> which is the Poynt of the left Wing of the Battaile; For here is to be vnderstood, that when Battailes of Foote are drawne vp and formed, then the Battaile of Horse is deuided, and extended forth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:27862:36"/>
in length, acording to the number of the <hi>Regiments,</hi> which as Wings stretching themselues foorth from the two points of the right and left hand battaile of Foot; are as a Wall or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense betwixt the Enemy &amp; the Foot Army, being to Charge vpon all aduantages, to defend the Ordnance &amp; great Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie when it shalbe Assaulted or ingaged; or otherwise to keep the Carriage, Munition and baggage, from the pillage of the Enemy, or other defeiture.</p>
               <p>For the range of the Colonels they take their places accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Antiquity; the eldest <hi>Colonell</hi> secondeth the <hi>Generall</hi> the third, the Lord <hi>Martiall,</hi> and so according to Antiquitie their Regiments doe troope, either on the one or the other hand, all things being ordered according to Dignitiy and Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Now whereas a question may be demanded touching the place of the <hi>Quartermaster,</hi> were he shall range himselfe; I thus resolue it. That if the <hi>Quarter-master,</hi> who is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary dependant vpon euery Horse Regiment, haue no troope of Horse, as seldome or neuer they haue, then his range or place is euer to troope with the <hi>Collonels Lieutenant,</hi> and the <hi>Commissary</hi> or <hi>Prouost</hi> of euery <hi>Regiment</hi> with the <hi>Liuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Collonels Liueteuant,</hi> or otherwise (at his pleasure) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagantly in any other inferior place of the Regiment.</p>
               <p>Againe, here is to be noted in the generallitie of the Army where Horse and Foote are mixed together, or whensoeuer they shall meet either in publicke Court or priuate Counsell, that the Commander of Horse hath priority of place before the Commander of Foot. And howsoeuer some opinions would sway to the contrary, preferring Number before Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; yet it is most certaine, that in all Courts of Warre, the Horseman hath the first place, a <hi>Collonell</hi> of 500. Horse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a <hi>Collonell</hi> of 1000. Foot. A Captaine of 100. Horse takes place before a Captaine of 200. Foot, &amp;c. Antiquity in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:27862:37"/>
this place being no let, but the Dignity carried according to the Honor of the Command, &amp; the Nobility of the number.</p>
               <p>Now next vnto these <hi>Curasheirs</hi> are the <hi>Harquebusheirs,</hi> who at this day, and in this present Discipline, stand for the Light Horse; these likewise haue two seuerall Ranges, the one in their ordinary Trooping; and the other, when they come to be drawne vp into ordinary or extraordinary Bodies: For the ordinarie Trooping, it is eyther when they Troope into the Fielde to receiue Directions, or else troope forth as <hi>Vantcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reers</hi> and Dicouerers of all Impediments that may happen to the Army, for these are they which Scower the Coast, and preuent Ambuscadoes, they make good Ryuers, Bridges, and all straight Passages, and albe their trooping is loose and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, holding no strickt or curious forme, eyther in Ranke or file, nor any certainety in Pace or Motion, but sometimes galloping, sometimes trotting, &amp; sometimes standing still, (as danger or discouerie shall giue way to their proceedings) yet doe they troope most commonly in <hi>Regiments,</hi> the <hi>Vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard</hi> being led eyther by the <hi>Colonell</hi> himselfe, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officer in Chiefe, who being better acquainted with the places they goe to discouer, hath this Authority cast vpon him, and Rangeth himselfe in the Front, which is the greatest Place of eminence: As the <hi>Colonell</hi> or chiefe Officer thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the First Place, so the <hi>Liuetenant Colonell</hi> taketh the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and so the rest of the Captaines successiuely, according to their antiquity: These are the ordinary Scoutes, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Sentinells, and if it be in Campe, their guard is euer without the Verge of the Campe, and if it be in a Walled Towne, Citty, or Garrison, their guard is without the walles of the Citty, and their Quarter in the Suburbes; there are Dependants on the Lord <hi>Marshall,</hi> and take directions from his Commands; and thus much for the Range of Horsemen.</p>
