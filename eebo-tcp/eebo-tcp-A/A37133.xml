         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe River <hi>Monomack,</hi> alias <hi>Merrimack,</hi> hath its inlet, or Eaſterly beginning
about 22 miles North and by Eaſt from <hi>Cape Ann,</hi> the North ſide of the

running Weſt Southerly, as far as <gap reason="illegible: page creased" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the South, and <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
on the North, where the River is about half a mile over, and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſwift, though mitigated by an Iſland in the midſt thereof; and from
thence to <hi>Haverhill</hi> VVeſt, South-VVeſt, and ſo continues its courſe VVeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as high as any ſettlement of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or diſcovery hath yet been made, and is ſaid to
proceed from the Lake of <hi>Troquoies,</hi> which falls into <hi>Hudſons</hi> River, and this of <hi>Merrimack;</hi>
but to my certain knowledge there is no principal branch, nor part of <hi>Merrimack</hi> that lies or
extends more Northerly then the North-ſide of the entrance or Rivers mouth, three Engliſh
miles to the Northward of which, into the Land, was built a little Hutt called <hi>Bound-houſe;</hi>
which ſaid Cottage, or place where it ſtood being in 43 degrees of Northern-Latitude, is the
Septentrional Confines of the <hi>Maſſathuſets</hi> line, nor did they pretend to any more, till the
New-ſetled Plantations in the Provinces of <hi>Mayn</hi> and <hi>New-hampſhire,</hi> being without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in danger of the Salvages, craved their Temporary protection, which having been
long continued, is now by the <hi>Boſtonians</hi> claim'd as their Rights.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if <hi>Merrimack</hi> River or any branch of it were found to run ſo far Northward as 45
degrees, and then taking into the Land three Engliſh miles farther North, from whence
ſtretching a direct line Eaſtward into the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, it muſt be own'd, that then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Mayn</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> do fall incluſively within the <hi>Maſſathuſets</hi> bounds.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe, from the Southward of the South-weſt ſtream of <hi>Charles</hi> River, and three
Engliſh miles Southward of that running a due South courſe into the Ocean, will be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the Provinces of <hi>Novum-belgium, New-haven, Conecticutt, Rhod-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>New-Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth:</hi>
The thoughts of which boundleſs poſſeſſions might ſwell them of the <hi>Maſſathuſets</hi>
Colony into an ambitious conceipt of being abſolute Lords and Proprietors of a Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and ſo arrogate to themſelves a Liberty of preſcribing Laws, and exerciſing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over all the Inhabitants of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to prevent their Title to ſo Copious a Claim, and ſettle other Patentees into their juſt
dues; It's preſumed, there is nothing more plain and demonſtrable (both from the courſe of
the Rivers, and the expreſs words of the Charter) then that the intent of the Patent, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31639:2"/>
bounds of the <hi>Maſſathuſets</hi> Grant, was, three Engliſh miles to the Northward of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernmoſt
banks of <hi>Merrimack,</hi> taking it Gradually into the Land parallel with the River as it
runs up into the Countrey, which is Weſt-Southerly; and, in the ſame manner not to exceed
three Engliſh miles to the Southward of the South-weſt part of <hi>Charles</hi> River, ſtill taking it up
along the ſaid Rivers ſide, and not from the heads or extream Branches thereof, and then
three Engliſh miles to the Southward or Northward of each River, and ſo run by courſe into
the Sea: which would include all the Southern and Northern Colonies aboveſaid, rendering
their Patents inſignificant and improperly Granted. Wherefore the hope of Your Majeſties
ſuffering Subjects depends wholly upon Your Majeſties Gracious Clemency, Wiſdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
for Relief in the matter; it being only in Your Majeſties Royal Power to put a final iſſue
to the Controverſies: which is earneſtly deſired by all that wiſh well to Your Majeſties inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and may be happily, honourably and ſucceſsfully done by Your Majeſties Purchaſing the
Provinces of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Mayne,</hi> of the aboveſaid Proprietors, which are ſituated and
furniſhed according to the Deſcription here following.</p>
            <p>THe Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> which was the aſſignment of Captain <hi>John Maſon,</hi> is
bounded on the South and South-weſt by the <hi>Maſſathuſets</hi> line North-Eaſtward upon the
Province of <hi>Mayne,</hi> on the Eaſt and South-Eaſt, by the Sea, ſtretching Weſtward into the
Continent, and lies between 43 and 44 degrees of North-Latitude; in which is compriſed
<hi>Newhampton,</hi> with ſeveral other Towns, Villages and ſpacious Farms pleaſantly ſituated, ſome
fronting the Sea, ſome within Land, and ſome upon the South-Weſt-ſide, or part of <hi>Paſcata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>-River,
where are built many Commodious and profitable Saw-mills, for cutting Plank,
Timber and Boards.</p>
            <p>THat part of <hi>America</hi> called <hi>Province of Mayn,</hi> takes its beginning at the entrance of <hi>Paſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taway</hi>
River, extending up the ſame to the River <hi>Newchewannick,</hi> to the extream part
thereof; and from thence North-Weſt, 120 miles, and from the mouth of <hi>Paſcataway</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
aforeſaid North-Eaſtward along the Sea-coaſt, to <hi>Sagadehock;</hi> and up the ſame to <hi>Kene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>-River,
as far as the head thereof, comprehending ſeveral Iſlands in the Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>North,</hi> half of the Iſles of <hi>Shoalds, Nantucket, Martins-Vineyard, Capanawagon, Richmonds</hi>-Iſland,
the <hi>Clap-board</hi> Iſlands, and ſundry others of very great importance for Fiſhing, Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Planting.</p>
            <p>The Climate and Air of this Province (as well as that of <hi>New-Hampſhire)</hi> is Temperate,
Sweet, Cleer and Healthy; the Soyles Fertile; the Harbors, Ports and Havens commodious
and ſafe, and the Countrey every where well furniſhed with Rivers, Brooks, Lakes, Ponds,
Streams and Springs; with ſtore of Champion-Ground, Ranges, Level-Land, Meadows,
Swamps, Thickets, Marches, Uplands, Hills, and fruitful valleys: where growes Tall Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars,
ſturdy Oaks, brave Elmes, tough Walnut, and ſtreight Cheſnut Trees; Fragrant Birch,
brown Beech, and multitude of Aſh, Maple, Aſp, Holly, Ivie, Hazle, Hawthorne, Shumach,
Willow, Buttonwood, Alder, Poplar and Saſſafras; with curious Cypreſs, Fir, Sprewſe and
Pines of a vaſt magnitude; and the moſt incomparable Timber for building Ships in the
World.</p>
            <p>There are alſo plenty of Vines which naturally yield three ſorts of pleaſant Grapes, the
firſt a large Whitiſh and mellifluous Grape, the ſecond a Purple colour of the ſame ſize, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
delicious, the third a ſmall Black Winter-grape, ſomewhat tart, but very wholſome and good.</p>
            <p>As for Orchard and Garden-Fruits, there are Apples of all ſorts, Pears of moſt kinds,
Peaches, Malagatoons, Quinces; Apricocks, Plums, Cherries, Currants, Hurts, Strawber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Cramberries, and Blewberries, alſo Musk-mellons, Water-mellons, and Cucumbers,
with all manner of Plants, Herbs and Roots; each Tree, Herb, Plant and Root, according
to its kind, brings forth Nuts, Berries, Fruit and Seeds.</p>
            <p>The Paſtures are cloathed with Graſs, and the Fields produce plenty of Wheat, Peaſe,
Barly, Rye and Oats, with ſome other ſorts of Grain, in which Fields and Grounds are bred
and raiſed huge droves of good Cattel, Horſes, Sheep and Hogs.</p>
            <p>But the natural inhabitants of the aboveſaid Woods, Hills and Swamps, are incredible
numbers of wild Beaſts, as Bears, Mooſe, Deer, Wolves, Foxes, Bevers, Otters, Minks, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
Muſquaſhes, Sables, Squirils, Rackoons, Wild-Cats, Hedg-hogs, Porcupines, Wild Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets,
Hares and Woodchucks.</p>
            <p>The Bowels of the Earth being no leſs enricht with plenty of Iron, Ore, Tin, Copper, Lead,
Coals, Sulphur, and other Minerals, which voluntarily offer themſelves to publick view, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſearching after, as if Nature were willing to diſcover, and disburthen her ſelf of what
our Ingenuities are ſlow in ſeeking.</p>
            <p>Nor know I any reaſon why Richer Mines ſhould not there be found, as well as in the
Neighbor-Colonies; in regard there is more external probality, and viſible encouragement
in theſe Provinces then was in any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31639:3"/>
The Production of the Rivers, Lakes and Ponds, is infinite quantities of freſh-water Fiſh,

            <p>The Iſlands adjacent, together with the Woods, Sea, Rivers, and Shoares, yield ſwarms of

Mankind, as contributes much to the Peopling and Planting of that Countrey, which in the
Summer is moſt delightful and pleaſant by the lovely ſhady Groves, ſweet ſinging Birds, and
cool Chriſtal ſprings.</p>
            <p>VVherefore if the great worth and intrinſick value of the aforeſaid Provinces were duly
conſidered, and by Your Majeſties Gracious Favour brought under the obedience of Your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Authority, there are certain and almoſt incredible advantages to be made, as well conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Your Majeſties benefit, the honour of Your Crown and Dignity, as alſo to the publick
good of that place a<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> this Nation, as may appear in the ſeveral particulars following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Imprimis.</hi> Were the Provinces of <hi>Mayn</hi> and <hi>New-hampſhire</hi> Purchaſed by Your Majeſty,
your Majeſty hath then the abſolute, real, actual Dominion and Soveraignty of thoſe Seas,
with the ſole propriety and benefit of all Fiſhing uſed on the Coaſts of <hi>New-England,</hi> and may
at your Royal Pleaſure ſettle a Duty or Impoſt upon all Fiſheries there, without intrenching
upon the Liberties of the <hi>Boſtoners</hi> Patent, the abrogation of their Priviledges, or the leaſt
wrong to the Inhabitants, and alſo in a ſhort time reduce, or win thoſe of the <hi>Maſſathuſets</hi>
and <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colonies to a ready Subjection and compleat Obedience.</p>
            <p>2. From hence Your Majeſty may be (at all times both in Peace and War) ſupplyed with
Maſts, Tarr, Timber, Plank, Boards, and Pipe-ſtaves, at a much cheaper, and eaſier rate then
now your Majeſty is, or by any other means can be; wherein conſiſts very much the ſafety of
your Majeſties Maritime Affairs.</p>
            <p>3. In theſe Provinces your Majeſty may ſettle a very conſiderable and profitable Trade
with the <hi>Indians,</hi> for Beaver and all other peltry; in regard they border ſo near upon <hi>Nova-ſcotia,</hi>
and are as well furniſhed with Lakes, Ponds and Rivers as that Countrey is, and alſo
with little charge improve all Mines and Minerals of worth there.</p>
            <p>4. By Your Majeſties being the <gap reason="illegible: page creased" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
of your Subjects, the proſperity of Your Plantations, the encouragement of Trade, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
and Commerce, be inexpreſſibly advanced, by uniting the Colonies, and ſecuring
the Ports and Countrey from invaſion.</p>
            <p>5. To the aforeſaid places Your Majeſty may in time of peace imploy ſome of Your great
Flemiſh Prizes to bring over Maſts, Deales, Timber and Staves, which will be of ſingular
benefit both to Your Majeſty and this Nation.</p>
            <p>6. By having the Propriety of theſe Provinces, Your Majeſty will receive a conſiderable
Revenue out of the Fiſh taken and made there, as alſo by a ſmall Duty upon all kind of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Raft that ſhall be Exported, which will be advantagious and of great value, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
thoſe Commodities are not to be had in any other part of <hi>New-England,</hi> but in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>New-hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Mayne,</hi> which may now be Your Majeſties for a ſmall ſum of
Money, or Trifle, compared with their true value and Conſequences.</p>
            <p>Theſe particulars are in all Humility, Duty, and ſubmiſſive Obedience Laid at Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Feet, and moſt Loyally propoſed by a Faithful Subject, to the end Your Sacred Majeſty
may be Abſolute in your Soveraignty, Greater in Riches, Name and Power, and that Your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Commands may be with reverence obeyed, Your Majeſties Laws executed, the Proteſtant
Religion cheriſhed, the Priviledges of Your Majeſties Subjects enlarged, Learning propagated,
and all Vertue encouraged. And that Your Majeſties good Subjects in thoſe parts may not
only have the <hi>Name</hi> of Your Majeſty, but alſo Your <hi>Power</hi> amongſt them, and thereby live
Peaceably, Happily and Quietly under Your Majeſties Royal Government, which Heaven
grant may be long, long and Proſperous.</p>
