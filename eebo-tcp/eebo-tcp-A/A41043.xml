            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>MAT. 12. 25.</bibl>
               <q>Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought to Deſolation.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words are a maxime, as moſt poſitive in the aſſertion, ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal in the extent: reading the deſtiny, and taking in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of all Kingdoms whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Be it the Empire of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, or that of the Devil; be it the pious Government of a rightful Prince, or Tyrannous violence of a Thief or Robber. The propoſition in all caſes remains unmoved. <hi>Every Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf is brought to deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay more, it obtains in all Societies of men, for it is added; that <hi>every City or Houſe divided againſt it ſelf ſhall not ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviours argument indeed is intended to concluded in the behalf of rightfull Governments,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49311:3"/>
and do's it with greater force and evidence becauſe it reacheth to the other, <hi>If Satan,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>caſt out Satan he is divided againſt himſelf, how ſhall then his Kingdom ſtand?</hi> There is, there muſt be a Beelzebub a prince of devils even in hell; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of malice, hatred and rebellion, muſt have ſome peace and order to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Again he adds, <hi>How can one enter into a ſtrong mans houſe and ſpoil his goods, except he firſt bind the ſtrong man, and then he will ſpoil his houſe?</hi> On this account it is that the ſturdy Thief confederats with others; obeys command, ſubmits to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, defends himſelf againſt the Law, by an obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious violation of it.</p>
            <p>God in the frame of man ſo built him for ſociety, that no depravation of his nature or his manners, can blot out the impreſſion. As vertue would communicate, vice would defend it ſelf; and in no condition is it <hi>good for man to be alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are all born naked and unarm'd, needing the aſſiſtance of each other; but wanting ſtrength or weapons to enforce it: but the divine Wiſdom has ſo ſuited things, that the ſtrong depends upon the weak, as much as the weak do's on the ſtrong: the rich is aſſiſted by the poor, as the poor is by the rich: the wiſe is aided by the ignorant, as the ignorant is by the wiſe. The Scepter reſts upon the mattock and the ſpade, and the Throne upon the plough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49311:3"/>The great animal of a Republic has as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parts, as much dependence of them on each other, as any living creature has. St. Paul at the 12. of the firſt to the Corinthians excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribes it. <hi>The eie cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no need of thee, nor again the hand unto the foot, I have no need of you, but thoſe members of the body which ſeem to be moſt feeble, are neceſſary. If the whole body were an eie, where were the hearing? if the whole were hearing, where were the ſmelling? and if they were all one member, where were the body? But God has ſo temperd the parts together, that</hi> the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as they have equal uſe, ſo <hi>they ſhould have the ſame care one of another; and whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; or one member be honord, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The repreſentation of this to the people of Rome, in their ſeditious departure from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, by Menenius Agrippa; perſuaded an immediate ſubmiſſion and return. I would to God the truth of the Goſpel, would have as juſt an effect on us, as the fable had with them.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>rebellion is the ſin of witchcraft</hi> one would wonder, by what enchantment men ſhould be perſuaded to diſturb at once their own and the public peace; forfeit all the advantages they enjoy in a ſetled Government, which cannot be ſo bad as not to be much better then the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49311:4"/>
which ſedition brings, and run upon that <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain deſtruction;</hi> which, the Wiſe man ſaies, <hi>is the end of thoſe who are given to change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>War however managed is calamitous enough. When a Kingdom though entire within it ſelf, is divided againſt another, it generally is bruiſed and batterd in the conflict, ſo that the Victor when he <hi>puts off his Armor</hi> has little reaſon to <hi>boaſt himſelf as when he put it on,</hi> But there ſometimes both parts ſurvive the quarrel, and the vanquiſht are advantag'd by their miſadventure, as the Nations whom the Greeks and Romans over-run, gain'd Laws, and Arts and Safety from their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; but Civil broils can have no triumph, nothing to balance or alleviat their miſchief.</p>
            <p>Tis a ſad ſight to ſee a wounded man beſmeard with gore, and faint with loſs of blood returning from a Battail; but tis in no proportion ſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, as to ſee one by phrenſy, like the Demoniac in the Goſpel, arm'd againſt himſelf, <hi>night and day ranging the mountains and the tombs, crying and cutting himſelf with ſtones, tearing and gnaſhing with his teeth and pining away, caſt ſometime into the fire, and anon into the water to be deſtroyed:</hi> which is the caſe of a Houſe, a City, or a Kingdom divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And this miſchief is the more to be feard and carefully avoided, becauſe tis almoſt in every ones
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49311:4"/>
power to work it. One ſingle man has ſkill and ſtrength enough to embroil a Nation, an Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom and Sheba did it to Iſrael, a Graccus a Sylla and a Marius did it in Rome, and one unquiet Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no brought Carthage with the mighty Hannibal, from the height of Empire, to utter deſolation. Nay creatures raked out of the dirt can do this. We all remember what a revolution a Maſſaniello lately made in Naples; and our Stories tell us what diſturbances a Straw, a Cade, a Tiler; a Ket, a Simnel have made in this our Country: that I omit the viler names of this our age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The beginning of ſtrife,</hi> ſaies the Wiſeman, <hi>is as the letting out of water;</hi> a breach which at firſt might have bin ſtopt with a mans hand, ſuddainly grows wide, and the torrent rouls upon it, and becoms irreſiſtible. We cannot but remember how fears and jealouſies emproved in this unhappy Country into a bloody War; and little diſcontents by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretenſes divided the Kingdom againſt it ſelf, till it verified the aſſertion in the Text, and ceaſt to be a Kingdom, and had not God by miracle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd, had certainly brought it to final deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>There has, tis true, paſt an Act of Oblivion of all theſe things; But ſure we are moſt unhappy if it take place ſo far, that we forget what we ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufferd, and repeat thoſe mad Diviſions which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49311:5"/>
will moſt certainly have the ſame or worſe events, then theſe they formerly procur'd.</p>
            <p>Were there not that natural connexion of things, which makes, as we have ſeen, the ruin of Societies neceſſarily conſequent to diviſions in them; had we not freſh experience to back our reaſonings: we may conſider farther, that God Almighty having ſaid it, he is concernd in his Veracity to bring his Word to paſs, and rather then fail, interpoſe his Omnipotence to compaſs it, and <hi>bring to deſolation a Kingdom divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, if we look into the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ſhall find, that when God deſigns a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a ſinful people, this is the means he uſes, nay this is one great part of the infliction.</p>
            <p>At the 19. of Iſaiah, he threatens Egypt, that he will <hi>ſet the Egyptians againſt the Egyptians, and they ſhall fight every one againſt his brother, and every one againſt his neighbor, city againſt city, and kingdom againſt kingdom: and the ſpirit of Egypt ſhall fail in the midſt thereof;</hi> that <hi>he will deſtroy its counſel, mingle a perverſe ſpirit in the midſt of it, and cauſe Egypt to erre in every work, as a drunken man ſtaggers in his vomit.</hi> So we ſee in fact, Jud. 7. and 1 Sam. 14. the Midianites and Philiſtins, without any previous diſcontent or quarrel, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally engag'd; <hi>every mans ſword turnd againſt his</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49311:5"/>
               <hi>brother.</hi> Which ſtate of ruin the Prophet Jeremy calls, <hi>Gods taking away his peace from a people, even loving kindneſs and mercies:</hi> the giving them <hi>the wine-cup of his fury, which when they have drunk they ſhall be moved and be mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it may be ſeaſonable that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think our ſelves, and ſoberly enquire how we ſtand in reference to this great concern; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are at peace, or in that ſtate of ruin which diviſion will certainly infer.</p>
            <p>And do's not herein our <hi>iniquity anſwer to our face?</hi> Is there almoſt any converſation but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the terms of Faction and Diſcord? Do's any man eſcape the character of Papiſt, Penſioner, and Courtier on the one hand; or Common-wealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Traitor, and Fanatic on the other? Are there not almoſt as many Religions, Factions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as there are Faces: nay is there not hazard that there ſhould be more, the ſame perſons in few moneths running thro ſeveral Sects and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Is not the <hi>ſpeaking evil of Dignities,</hi> and reproching Things and Perſons ſacred, become the dialect and language of the time? Is not all protection and ſupport due from Superiors, and all ſubmiſſion and induſtry paiable by inferiors, quite loſt among us? Is there any care of the Public either Intereſt or Safety? Nay are not all the bleſſings
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49311:6"/>
we enjoy, forgot and forfeited in the thought of ſomewhat which we fain would have, or jealouſy that poſſibly we may loſe ſomewhat that we now poſſeſs?</p>
            <p>This is evidently our caſe: and do we not ſee a writing on the wall, like that deſcribed in the book of Daniel, <hi>Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharſin,</hi> that <hi>God has numbred our Kingdom and finiſht it,</hi> that <hi>we are weighed in the balance and found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that <hi>our Kingdom is divided and given unto Strangers?</hi> We need not look out for a maſter of Magicians to decipher or unfold the writing, tis ſo plain that he who runs may read it. This is the Comet that blazes in our Sky; and threatens Ruine and Deſtruction to us, beyond the abodings of Aſtrology.</p>
            <p>The danger then is ſufficiently confeſt: I wiſh we were ſo well agreed upon the remedie. But as it happens in our bodily diſtempers, ſo it fares in this of the public, every man is a Phyſician and has ſomewhat to preſcribe.</p>
            <p>And firſt, tis offerd as of moment to ſtrengthen our ſelves by Alliances abroad. This were indeed of uſe in reference unto a Foreign enemy; but cannot obviat the miſchief which riſes here at home. Tis to like purpoſe as if for an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume in the brain, or Ulcer in the bowels, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhould put a helmet on his head, or apply
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49311:6"/>
a plaſter to his breaſt. Beſides, it is not eaſie to imagine, that any prudent State will think it worth the while, to joyn with them who diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, tis ſuggeſted that our ſafety ſhould be provided for by good and wholſome Laws; which might indeed avail, were we in a temper to obey them. As the caſe now ſtands, a Phyſician may as well hope to cure his Patient by writing of long bills, and preſcribing ſeveral recipes, which will be never taken or regarded; as we expect advantage from the multiplying of Acts. Ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are commonly ſaid to produce good laws: but we do not find that the beſt laws without a vigorous execution; can produce good manners.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, there is a ſort of men who would commend a more forcible expedient, the ſecurity of a ſtanding Army. Empirics indeed, who to cure an Ague think it adviſable to throw the patient into a Feavor; who tell us that War is the ſureſt way to keep the Peace. I will not argue how well this method may agree with the complexions of a more Southern climate, it is enough our rougher conſtitutions will never ſuit with ſuch a medicin.</p>
            <p>A fourth propoſal is of thoſe who lay all the blame of our diviſions on the male adminiſtration of affairs by evil Counſellors, and reſolve that if theſe troublers of our Iſrael were brought to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49311:7"/>
condign puniſhment, all would be well imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly. But the worſt ont is, we have a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that this expedient will not do our work; for that we have often ſhifted thoſe we have moſt complaind of, but ſtill retaind the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.

            <p>A fifth propoſall is, that liberal ſupplies be made to cleer the public debts, and ſupport the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for its honour and defence. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is moſt neceſſary to be don. But tis fond to think that this can make a cure. The dying Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer may as well hope for life by applying a bag of mony to his heart, as a ſick State expect a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from pecuniary ſupplies. A clock whoſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are decaied, will not go well though the weights hung at it are of Gold.</p>
            <p>But ſixtly as a Catholicon and ſure reſerve, it is propoſed, to unite the diſagreeing intereſts in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. A moſt deſirable deſign indeed, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be of great effect if it can be compaſſed. This is a work worthy the counſel and the care of the great Aſſembly of the Nation, the legiſlation of Parliaments, and ſanction of Synods. In this caſe, moſt eſpecially, it may be ſaid, that <hi>God ſtands</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Religion like Truth and God himſelf, can be but one: Even the Garment of our Saviour was ſo far from admitting a rent, that it was without ſeam. However ſimilar bodies are multiplied by being broken into parts; in Chriſtianitie, which is the body of Chriſt the head, what is divided is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The multitude of the firſt Believers were not only <hi>of one heart and one ſoul,</hi> but <hi>came together with one accord into one place;</hi> and when the numbers of Diſciples grew too large for ſuch a meeting, their mutual communication with each other, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to them ſtill the ſelf ſame union: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the method of the primitive Church. <hi>Totus orbis commercio formatarum, &amp; una communionis ſocietate concordabat,</hi> as ſaies Optatus lib. 2. <hi>The whole world was united by the commerce of credentiall letters, and the fellowſhip of communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Abſtractedly ſpeaking, It is the duty of every Chriſtian, to communicate in holy offices with every Chriſtian; and likewiſe tis the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, to admit all others to the like communion. So that whatever impunity human Laws may give to ſeparation, they can never make it lawful;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49311:8"/>
twil ſtill be ſin though it have the encouragement of innocence.</p>
            <p>Indeed Schiſm is ſo ſeverely branded in the holy Scripture, that even they who place their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in ſeparation acknowledge the guilt of it; and lay the blame of their diſſent on thoſe from whom they differ; alleging either the immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their lives, or errors in the Faith: and in fine, reſolve their ſeparation is therefore innocent becauſe twas neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſs that notwithſtanding the ſtrict obligation to an entire agreement among all Chriſtians; it is not likely, nay not poſſible to be obtain'd: for beſides the ready excuſe of caſting blame on others, and the perpetual ſubterfuge, that peace is never to be ſought for with the loſs of truth; which makes an out-let for all ſelf opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated men, who will be ſure to guild their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors with the name of truth, and make up their defect of knowledge, with abundance of perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there are very many ſo full of malice, that nothing is ſo hatefull to them as the name of Peace, ſo that as the Pſalmiſt ſaies, <hi>if any one ſpeak to them thereof, they make themſelves ready to battel.</hi> But over and above all this, there is upon the part of Almighty God a fatal bar impoſd, he having ſaid, <hi>there muſt be hereſies</hi> in the Church; and that <hi>tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary offences ſhould come, that they who are approved may be made manifeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49311:8"/>So that they who propoſe to themſelves the uniting either all Chriſtians, or all Proteſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, or thoſe who <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve even the ſlighteſt differences between themſelves; will be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the piety of their deſign, then the ſucceſſe and iſſue of it.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak diſtinctly to our preſent caſe. Popery in its unhappy additions to the <hi>faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints,</hi> is a Religion made up of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and cruelty, hypocriſy and profaneſs, of craft and folly: but yet it has not ſo exhauſted the whole nature of ill, but that there are ſeveral other Sects pretending to Chriſtianity extremely bad.</p>
            <p>And the ſame principle of duty to Almighty God, that forbids an orthodox Son of the Engliſh Church to communicate with Popery, muſt alſo as forcibly oblige not to communicate with them; and what we do upon juſt conviction, every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter is directed to by the ſway of his opinion; and will be as little gratified by the wideſt and moſt comprehenſive Scheme, if it oblige unto communion on the terms which it holds forth, without which it do's nothing, as now they are with the eſtabliſht conſtitution of the Church.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Church in reference to the preſent ſtate of things, has very rightly by a great wiſe man bin compar'd unto a fortified Town, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49311:9"/>
denominations of diſſenters, to ſo many Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about her: now in caſe of an aſſault from a common enemy, which God knows lies hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as it would be a great imprudence in the Citizens, not to give all encouragement to thoſe without, to come within the line, and ſhare the ſafety of it: ſo twould be utter madneſs in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers, to continue ſtill without, or demand that the walls or works ſhould be demoliſht, that they might dwell with better eaſe, or more unto their mind.</p>
            <p>When Julian the Apoſtate labored with all his force and ſkill to extirpate Chriſtianity, the means he uſed was to encourage the ſeveral Sects of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics in their differing waies of worſhip, as we learn from Ammianus Marcellinus a Heathen writer in his 22. book. <hi>Diſſidentes Chriſtianorum antiſtires cum plebe diſciſſa in palatium intromiſſos, monebat ut civilibus diſcordiis conſopitis, quiſque nullo vetante religioni ſuae ſerviret,</hi> The Emperor <hi>calling to him in his Palace the heads of the divided ſects of Chriſtians, both Prieſts and People, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhd them, that laying aſide civil diſcords, every one without controul ſhould exerciſe his own way of worſhip.</hi> And then adds; <hi>that this was thus diligently don by him, that diſſentions being encreaſed by licence, be might from thence forth be ſecure from danger of the Chriſtians unanimity; having experimentally found</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49311:9"/>
               <hi>that no wild Beaſts are ſo enraged againſt one another, as diſagreeing Chriſtians.</hi> And we know how this very thing, has bin from time to time endeavourd by the Factors for the Roman Church. And it would be exceeding ſtrange if the readieſt way to bring in Popery, and extirpate the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtianity, ſhould now be thought a good expedient to promote the Proteſtant intereſt.</p>
            <p>The practiſe of our Neighbour State, is indeed urged to ſhew the ſafety and advantage of leaving Religion at large; but tis obvious to ſee what foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Popery has thereby got among them; which their public writings fruitleſsly complain of: and what progreſs other Sects have made, the numbers of Socinians and Jews, and ſome of a worſe mark, will plainly evidence.</p>
            <p>When Chriſtianity was lately under perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Japan, there were a ſort of men that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered they were Hollanders, and ſo eſcaped the Teſt. Were we here profeſſors of that cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; a toleration of all, or poſſibly of no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, might well conſiſt with peace; eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guard of a Military force, but they little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Engliſh temper that think the like indifference will paſs with us.</p>
            <p>When all is don, there is no poſſible expedient to heal our diviſions, till there be firſt procur'd a mutual deſire to have them heal'd. To this end
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49311:10"/>
it would be of great effect that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> advice ſhould be conſidered, <hi>That the ſtrong would not deſpiſe the weak, nor the weak judge the ſtrong:</hi> that the knowing would <hi>with meekneſs inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe themſelves,</hi> and the oppoſers would lay aſide hoſtility, <hi>and receive with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the engrafted word, and grow thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did men but heartily deſire a reconcilement, did they thoroly conſider that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> as it now ſtands <hi>divided againſt it ſelf muſt</hi> certainly <hi>be brought to deſolation,</hi> and that nothing but a cloſure can avert it, how would thoſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which now appear like mountains, ſhrink into mole-hills; and that which we have hitherto taken for <hi>a beam in our brothers eie,</hi> ſeem ſcarce <hi>a mote,</hi> and that poſſibly not in his but in our own? How would the motives of diſcord and defiance, with which we have hitherto whet our ſelves againſt each other, put in the balance with our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to charity and love, prove light as air, nay <hi>lighter then vanity it ſelf?</hi> Good God! we have <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one common Hope, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and thro all, and in us all:</hi> and why are we not one among our ſelves? If we look down to earth, tis curſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with Thorns and Briers, but made more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſt by our quarels and conteſts: if we look up to Heaven, that wide extent is capable to entertain us

all; <hi>there are many Manſions,</hi> and thoſe ſo large as will not fail to fill the moſt inſatiat deſire. No place but hell can give us countenance for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and ſtrife: and yet the Rebel diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient man will want a preſident from thence, for even there the Fiends ſubmit to order and command.</p>
            <p>What words ſhall I take up to enforce upon you a value and deſire of peace? Shall I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you by all the charms of love, thoſe holy incantations which alone can take away the ſting and venim of the ſerpent, and make him innocent as the Dove?

            <p>I am faln upon atheme on which it were very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to enlarge, and while I do ſo thus in generals, may hope to find a favourable audience.

            </p>
            <p>And firſt to take the words in their plain and moſt natural ſenſe, I may uſe the reply of Jehu to Joram that aſkt if it were Peace. <hi>What peace ſo long as the whoredoms of Jezebel, and her witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> Can there be peace in families, when the Whore uſurps the place, the affection and ſupport of the lawful Wife, when luſt engages in wild pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, in quarrels and expences, and wages amidſt all a perpetual war in the members?</p>
            <p>This is the ſin that <hi>takes away the heart, brings to a morſel of bread, gives rotteneſs to the bones, a reproch and blot unto the name, roots up foundations;</hi> nay as Solomon ſaies, who made the moſt coſtly experiment, <hi>deſtroies Kings.</hi> This is the ſin which as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>takes the members of Chriſt and makes them members of an harlot, defiles the temple of God,</hi> and then ſure nothing leſs can be expected, then what the ſame Apoſtle infers from thence: <hi>If any one defile the temple of God, him will God deſtroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look we over the Annals of the World from the beginning of time unto this preſent moment, you ſhall ſee that there ſcarcely any where has hapned a great Calamity or fatal Revolution, which has
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49311:12"/>
not either bin the immediat effect, or at leaſt in a great meaſure the ſequel of this ſin.</p>
            <p>And if ever uncleaneſs was the complexion of an age, ſhelter'd by impunity and great example, till it out faced the day, as if it would no more be thought <hi>a work of darkneſs:</hi> but filling up the character the Prophet gives of <hi>an imperious whoriſh woman, has a brow of braſs, and knows no ſhame,</hi> this is the time. <hi>The Princes and the Nobles when they were fed unto the full, then they committed adultery, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves by troops in the harlots houſes; they were as fed horſes in the morning, every one neighd after his neighbours Wife.</hi> And <hi>ſhall I not viſit for theſe things ſaies the Lord: and ſhall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this:</hi> Jer. 5. All the former inſtances of ſhameleſs guilt would be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don by this one act of impudence, to expect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity amidſt ſuch provocations.</p>
            <p>Next to this <hi>luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> we may reckon thoſe which St. John calls <hi>the luſt of the eie, and the pride of life,</hi> the impotent deſire of Riches, Pleſures and Preferment; thoſe certain parents of Faction and Diſcord, among men. Beſides that wide deſires do look for large ſupplies, which ſtill engage in eager competitions: as a defeat brings rage and anger, and new contentions and deſignes, ſo a ſucceſs creates freſh wants, and keener appetites, and yet more vigorous purſuits;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49311:13"/>
ſo that whatever happens, there is an endleſs circle of rage repining and conteſt. <hi>We luſt and have not,</hi> ſaies St. James, <hi>we kill and deſire to have, and cannot obtain: we fight and war and yet we have not, becauſe we ask not; we ask and receive not; becauſe we ask amiſs, that we may conſume it upon our luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till this voracious humor is appeaſd, till that neceſſity is the meaſure of our wants, and uſe the rule of our deſires, and the providence of God and his diſpoſal, the certain gage of both; our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and hoſtilities can never have an end.</p>
            <p>But thirdly there is another ſort of luſt, no leſs deſtructive to the intereſts of peace then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; it is that of miſguided zeal, which from the authority of St. Paul I muſt declare to be as errant ſenſuality, as is that of the ſtews and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel houſe. <hi>The works of the fleſh,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, which are theſe; adultery, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs, laſciviouſneſs, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, zeal,</hi> which we render emulation, <hi>wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings, murders, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, revellings</hi> and ſuch like. We might a little wonder to find zeal, which in our world uſurps the encloſure of godlineſs, placed in ſo ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, did we not find the ſame St. Paul, at the third of the Philippians acknowledging that <hi>by zeal</hi> he <hi>perſecuted the Church,</hi> and ſo became <hi>the chief of ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49311:13"/>Indeed, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>tis good to be zealouſly affected in a good thing,</hi> but when tis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with pride and ſingularity, when it becomes embitterd, and is that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which St. James complains of, there is nothing in the world more miſchievous then it: if any one think otherwiſe, let him read the ſtory of the Zelots in Joſephus, he will be abundantly convinc'd.</p>
            <p>This is that diabolical carnality, by which men deflour the Spouſe of Chriſt, and adulterate the Word of God: the leaders wherein are deſcrib'd by St. Paul to be <hi>traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleſures more then lovers of God, having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof; of which ſort are they that creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly women laden with ſins, led away with divers luſts.</hi> And by St. Jude they are declar'd to be <hi>they who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the Spirit.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt, in his firſt deſcent came down in Tongues of fire; and the falſe pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Spirit, come with like appearances, even there <hi>the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity, it ſets on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſet on fire of hell,</hi> Jam. 3.</p>
            <p>Let us not deceive our ſelves with emty ſhapes and vain appearances, whatever habit Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence puts on, tho it <hi>transform it ſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> tis ſtill but Luſt; and ſo long as it remains,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49311:14"/>
howere diſguis'd, we ſhall not fail of <hi>wars and fightings among us. The wicked,</hi> ſaies Iſaiah, <hi>are like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt. There is no peace ſaies my God unto the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here tis to be conſidered that the Apoſtle do's not ſay, tis the ambition of the Stateſman, the diſputing of the Scholar, the faction of the Mechanic, the oppreſſion of the Rich, or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Poor, the diſſolution of this ſort of men, or hypocriſy of that, <hi>from whence are Warrs and fightings;</hi> but ſaies incluſively to all <hi>Tis from your Luſts:</hi> and till that we do ſay ſo too, till each man ſpeaks it to himſelf, there will be no removal of the incumbent judgment, for that there is not an amendment of the provoking guilt. Let every one ſweep before his own dore, and then, but not till then, the whole Street will be made clean.</p>
            <p>If then we are in earneſt, if really we would have Peace, that there <hi>be henceforth no decay, no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our ſtreets;</hi> we know upon what terms tis to be had.

               <hi>being renewed in the Spirit of the mind, ſo as to put on the new man, which after God is created in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true holineſs?</hi> if it be, behold the purchaſe lies before you. <hi>Mark the perfect man,</hi> ſaies David, <hi>and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> Pſ. 37. and again; <hi>When a mans waies pleaſe the Lord, even his enemies ſhall be at peace with him.

            <p>You being juſtly ſenſible of the Calamitous <hi>diviſions</hi> of theſe unhappy Kingdoms, which if not cloſed muſt <hi>bring it to deſolation;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſenſible how unavailable human counſels are to anſwer ſuch an exigence, have addreſt your ſelves to him, whoſe privilege it is, to <hi>Counſell the Counſellors and teach the Senators</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49311:15"/>
               <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> and in a ſolemn manner, calling to <hi>faſting, and weeping, and mourning, and girding with ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,</hi> You deſign to invite the Divine pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; that <hi>we repenting of the evil of our doing, the Lord may alſo repent of the evil which he thought to do to us, be gracious to his Land and pity his people, even return and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho, as Job expreſſes it, <hi>Affliction riſes not out of the duſt,</hi> neither <hi>do's trouble ſpring out of the ground,</hi> yet their relief muſt grow from thence. When <hi>the ſoul cleaves unto the duſt,</hi> and the body is proſtrate on it: When <hi>ſackcloth is the clothing,</hi> and <hi>tears are the meat day and night,</hi> then is the ſeaſon for the Almighty to afford his comforts, and his aids, to <hi>lift up thoſe that are caſt down, comfort them that mourn, give beauty for aſhes, the oil of gladneſs for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs.</hi> When the ſentence of exciſion was pronounc'd on Nineveh; <hi>Yet forty daies and Nineveh ſhall be overthrown:</hi> and they <hi>proclam'd a Faſt, and put on ſackcloth from the greateſt of them, even to the leaſt of them; cried mightily unto God, and turned every one from his evil way, and from the violence that was in their hands: God ſaw their works that they turnd from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Jon. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49311:16"/>There is a memorable caſe in the book of Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, that the Jews in a great exigence, after the death of Gedaliah, and the outrages therewith committed, fearing the anger of the Chaldean Conqueror, applied themſelves unto the Prophet, to enquire in their behalf at the mouth of God; who undertakes the agency, and aſſures them <hi>that whatever the Lord ſhall anſwer, he will declare it unto them, and keep nothing back from them:</hi> And they on the other ſide aſſure the Prophet, by a ſolemn vow upon themſelves, <hi>that whether it be good, or whether it be evil, they would obey the voice of the Lord, that it may be well with them, when they obeid the voice of the Lord:</hi> Yet after all this, when God had returnd the kindeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer imaginable, that they ſhould <hi>ſit ſtill and be quiet,</hi> and then they ſhould be ſafe, <hi>that they ſhould</hi> then <hi>be built up and not puld down, planted and not plucked up;</hi> this his condition they refus'd, and thereupon fell under his laſt and heavieſt Judgment. Jerem. 42.</p>
            <p>I would not be ſo uncharitable to ſuggeſt that this may be our caſe; that men of Birth, of Honor and Religion, when by their ſolemn Act they have procur'd a Faſt, to attone the anger of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and reconcile them to his favour: made an appointment that his Meſſenger ſhould in his name declare his Will, and thereupon come
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49311:16"/>
publicly into his Houſe to hear it; which proves to be no more then this, That they ſhould live with the dignity of men, and quit their brutiſh luſts; ſhould after all, do ſo falſe ſo baſe a thing, as not act according to the meſſage they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</p>
            <p>Every one of either Houſe of Parliament, who aſſented to the Vote for a day of Humiliation; every man who attends that ſervice, has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively ſaid all the words that the Jews did to the Prophet, that <hi>whether it be good, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be evill, they would obey the voice of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now lay we our hand upon our heart, and ſeriouſly conſider the exigence and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; the engagement here incurr'd, and the anſwer we return. What I have ſaid before, I now repete again; and declare as the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, in his Name and in his behalf; that <hi>Our Kingdom</hi> thus <hi>divided againſt it ſelf will be brought to deſolation.</hi> I ſay alſo, that <hi>Our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are from our luſts,</hi> and that only repentance and amendment, can remove either them or the judgments due unto them. In plain terms I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that nothing but our religious ſervice, can ſecure our civil freedom: nothing but obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the laws of God, can preſerve thoſe of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49311:17"/>
the land: nothing but a reformd life, can conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to us the reformd religion. In a word, nothing but peace with heaven, can give us peace and happineſs on earth.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak unto Wiſe and Great men; <hi>conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all things.</hi>
