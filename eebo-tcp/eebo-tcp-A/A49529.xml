            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Examiners answer, there is littlemateriall, if once the principall doubt bee cleared, whether Bishops had auncient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly votes in Parliaments, and were Barons, or that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, or superiour unto Barons, being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Thanes,</hi> in the times of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> before the Conquest, which I hope is so fully cleared in thisfollowing discourse, as there will be little question remaining. Though Parliaments began as our Histories shew, long after the Conquest,

in this manner, as now they are held, yet they had Assemblies, (<hi>Gemotts</hi>) of the Estates and principall Nobility, whereof the Bishops and Clergy were alwayes an eminent party according to the lawes and custome of those times, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qnivalent in authorityto our Parliament: They hadseverall <hi>Gemotts:</hi> as the first was.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THAT the BISHOPS and principall Clergy were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of great authority in our Common-wealth, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for making of lawes, and constitutions of all kinds, is manifest, by all the lawes themselves of the Saxon Kings for the first 500. yeares before the Conquest: wherein they first testify that the lawes were made by the consent, suffrage, and approbation of their Bishops, whom they doe mention. So in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the lawes of King <hi>Ina:</hi> — <hi>Ego</hi> Ine <hi>Dei</hi>

            <p>The same appeares, by the subscriptions to the lawes, by the Bishops and principall Clergy of their severall times, which is so frequently to be observed in the first Tome of our English Councells, that I will forbeare particulars.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Likewise for their dignity, order and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Clergy were reckoned, and accounted equall with the best, as appeares by the lawes of divers Kings, and first, of the first christian King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> who, in his lawes, doth provide in the first place for their rights and priviledges; and what satisfaction shall be made for any wrong done to the Church, or Bishops, or Clergy.</p>

            <p>These being the first lawes of our first Christian King, they ought to be reverenced for their antiquity, piety, and Christian Iustice in rendring to every man his owne due, though now some men talke, not only of taking away superfluities, but of cutting up both root and branches. <hi>O tempora!

            </p>
            <p>And afterwards, about the time of King <hi>Withred,</hi> there were lawes made.</p>

            <p n="3">III.

            <p n="5">V.

And when matters, in question, were only Ecclesiasticall concerning the Church, and Religion, the Clergy sate by themselves, but when there was any thing to bee given and confirmed to the Church, then the Kings and Nobles did afford their presence and assistance, as appeares by divers Councells. <hi>Vid.

            <p>This objection is frivolous; because the Bishops are as carefull for the preservation of the publique, wherein standeth the safety of themselves and their successours, as any Temporall Lords can be, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the more, because temporall Lords doe often fall into great wantand poverty, selling sometimes thevery head of their Baronies, and so may become very obnoxious, and also ambitious to recouer and rayse themselves to higher Honours, titles, or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:

whereas the Bishops move not much higher, though they may get a better Bishoprick, which is not so great a temptation, asto make them forget themselves, or the trust reposedin them, but rather layes a greater obligation on them.</p>

Wherein the Clergy have some opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to excell others, and often doe goe beyond the ordinary sort of men that are not bred up in learning, Arts, and Sciences.</p>
            <p>And as S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> observes, out of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Roman law, there belongs to every subject cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine common rights and priviledges, which cannot be taken from any of them. 1. <hi>Ius civitatis.</hi> 2. <hi>Ius connubij.</hi> 3. <hi>Ius suffragii.</hi> 4. <hi>Ius petitionis,</hi> or <hi>Ius Honorum.</hi> These foure ordinary rights and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, are by the customes and originall principles of humane societies due to all citizens of quality, such as ever the Clergy have been esteemed, and still ought to be, if men will professe themselves to be true Christians indeed, and to honour the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Embassadours of our Saviour Christ, whom he hath appointed to instruct and governe his Church and people. The Pope deprived his Clergy of the two former rights, by accounting them sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and exempt from the common lawes ofall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62291:15"/>
and forbidding marriage to them. And now our zealous professours would deprive our Clergy of the two later priviledges; the right of voyce, and suffrage in all principall businesses: and the right of honour and office, whereof they would make them uncapable, and render them base, and equall only to the inferiour multitude, and scumme of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. If the Clergy might now enjoy those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient priviledges, which are mentioned in scripture, as <hi>Genes.</hi> 47. of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> who in the time of famine and great extreamity <hi>spared the Priests lands, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them their portion, so that they sold not their lands,</hi> then men might talke of applying their studies and meddling with no common or worldly busines. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the Persian king, (<hi>EZra.</hi> 7. 24.) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that for all the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the house of God, it should not be lawfull to impose toll, tribute, or custome upon them.</hi> Whereas now the Clergy being made subject to the most sort of payments, charges, and impositions in a greater proportion commonly then other men; it is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that some of the Clergy should have voyce and suffrage in the lawes, that are enacted for their government and taxation.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Besides, the course of lawes and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is not much altered from what was in those dayes, when holy Fathers spake of wholy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themselves to prayers and sacred studies, and diligent preaching of the Gospell: as if they were to


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62291:16"/>
doe nothing else, not so much as to provide bread, or necessaries for their families, for then they lived most part single, in Colledges and Monasteries, and societies under the Bishops, where all provisions were made by Stewards and Officers, appointed, for the purpose, so that their cares in all those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects were lessened and abated much; that they might apply their studies only, and forsake all worldly businesse, which now they cannot forgoe being secular and parochiall Ministers, married men, and thereby charged with children and families; and also made obnoxious to all lawes, suits, and impositions, without any exemptions or priviledges. So that it is but a monasticall, and in part a Popish fancy, to talke so much of applying their studies, and only preaching the Gospell: for by many a writ and warrant from severall Courts of Iustice, and Constables, they shall be hindred and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to attend secular and litigious proceedings, and answer to all bills of complaint, declarations, and vexations, that shall hinder their preaching and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, more then a voluntary imployment, at fit sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in some publique Office.</p>

Secondly to preserve the innocent from contagion by the separation of of open offendors.

It is manifest also, that many cases are partly temporall, and partly spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and that scarce any is so temporall, but that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in some order to spirituall things, or any so spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall but that it hath some relation to temporall things, so that the true subject of Ecclesiasticall and civill Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, cannot rightly be divided.</p>
            <p>I demand then, why should the Courts bee divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? which was done first among us by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour. And why should not there bee Iudges partly spirituall, as well as temporall in all Courts? (saving for the danger of innovation:) as it was anciently among the Saxons? or at least, why should not the supreame Court of Iustice, which is to give law to all other Courts, bee well tempered, and mingled with all sorts of men, Ecclesiasticall and Civill, the wisest, and choycest that can be found in the whole state, and kingdome? Why not <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> admitted into the number, as well as in the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of the Iewish commonwealth, which was equall to our Parliament, and was instituted by God himselfe?

concerned God &amp; matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were principall and necessary men to be imployed: as may clearely appeare by the doings of King <hi>David,</hi> about removing of the Arke, to the place, that he had provided for it: Whereupon King <hi>Iames</hi> hath written a very pious and excellent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>pag:</hi> 81. upon the 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. some of whose words I will here recite. When the Arke of God <note place="margin">2.

Chron. 13. 12.</note> God that day, saying, <hi>How shall I bring the Arke of God home to me?</hi> So the Arke rested in the house of <hi>Obed Edom.</hi> But afterwards upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better advise <hi>David</hi> perceived his errour, and he confesseth it. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. 12, 13. speaking to the chiefe of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites.

For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you did it not at the first, The Lord God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not, after the due Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a great and a godly worke, that was then intended, and therefore King <hi>David</hi> called a great

            <p>But now upon better advise, King <hi>David</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the first, <hi>the children of Aaron and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites:</hi> ver. 4. <hi>So that men of all Estates</hi> were now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in this godly worke: This is to bee marked well of Princes, and of all those of any high calling or degree that hath to doe in Gods cause: <hi>David</hi> doth nothing in matters pertaining to God without the presence and especiall concurrence of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, appointed to bee spirituall rulers in Gods Church. And at the first meant to convay the same Arke to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> finding their absence and want of their Counsell hurtfull: therefore hee saith to them. — <hi>Yee are the chiefe Fathers of the Levites. Because yee did it not at the first.</hi> Thus saith <hi>King Iames</hi> of blessed memory; but now there is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, who doe not thinke the Clergy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary men to bee consulted: that will interpret scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, remove the Arke, as it were, and doe things without the presence, vote, and suffrage of the chiefe Fathers of the <hi>Levites:</hi> which how it agreeth with this pious example of <hi>King David,</hi> and <hi>King Iames</hi> meditation upon it, I leave to be considered, <hi>and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to better judgements.</hi>

the instant request of the Nobility it was granted. — <hi>Vt communia placita non sequentur curiam (</hi> 1. <hi>Regis) Sed in loco certo tenerentur.</hi> That the Courts of Iustice for common pleas should not follow the Kings Court Royall but be held in a place certaine, as now commonly they are in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall. Whereas before the Kings appointed one Grand-Lord chiefe Iustice of all England, who for his authority and power, was a greater Officer both of State and Iustice, then any in these last A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ever since that Office was diminished by King Ed. 1. and most of those great Iustices were Bishops, till at length the Pope forbad it.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIIII. But the Courts being now divided in the kingdome many hundred yeares, the Ancient manner is forgotten and unknowne, save only to the learned, and the scarres of the Norman Conquest are so overgrowne, that few men are sensible, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of slavery doe still remaine upon us, by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the order of the Courts, the language of the law, in great part, with other things that I will not now mention. But being so setled by the Conqueror, and continued by his successours, the Temporall Courts in processe of time, grew too powerfull for the Ecclesiasticall, and by their Injunctions and prohibitions stopt many proceedings, especially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Councell of <hi>Clarendon.</hi> under <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of the Clergy was much abated. And all Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction so crushed that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued lame ever after: although the Clergy by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62291:24"/>
to Rome, did oftentimes help themselves, and much molest their adversaries. At length under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. upon his breach with the Pope, the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Iurisdiction was much abridged and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in very many particulars, and reduced to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compasse, becoming much more subject and obnoxious to the Injunctions, orders, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of all the Temporall Courts, that now I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that any should complaine, or envy at their power or greatnes, there being no cause of any value, or moment but by one order or other, isdrawne from them to the Temporall Courts. And now at last there want not some, that would have all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Authority and Iurisdiction, either wholy sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed from the first Court to the last, or at least so abated, mingled, or changed that what forme, or force of government shall be left remaining, seems very uncertaine. But if Presbyteries and such like consistories of the forraigne and new fangled devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing were erected, there will follow great confusion and disorder to the infinite disturbance of peace and quietnesse in the kingdome, by alteration ofso many lawes and customes, and of the common law it selfe, whereby the kingdome hath been governed so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, and setled in peace, and all mens estates and lands held in certaine possession. For such great and universall changes as will follow upon the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Hierarchy, and taking away their votes in Parliament, and other eminent parts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will produce such ill events, and troublesome


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62291:25"/>
distractions, as will not be pacified within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of any mans life now in being. — Which I heartily pray God to prevent, and by his good spirit so to direct and blesse the endeavours and counsells of the supreame Court of Iustice, now assembled, that all our feares and doubts may bee quieted, and the voice of peace and truth restored to our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p>But because what I have formerly said, touching the uniting of the Ecclesiasticall and Temporall Courts, may seem strange to many, I desire not to bee mistaken, as if I perswaded any innovation or change of setled lawes, and Courts of Iustice. Which would be a thing of dangerous consequence, that no wise man will advise, but leave all to the wisdome of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, to whom properly it belongs. Only I will adde a few lines touching the auncient forme and manner of government in the Empire, after that the Emperours became Christians from whom 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the example was taken both among us, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdomes.</p>

in the world, rising out of the Bishops sloath (as one, though otherwise eloquent and learned, mis-called them) but had their Originall from the Law it selfe.</p>
            <p>Touching whom, I will here say something out of the learned Civilians, because commonly their place and Originall is much mistaken by the ignorantly zealous people, who doe now abound in the world, and thinke nothing lawfull in government, unlesse there be expresse text of scripture for it: as if no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, government, or subordination of Officers in the Church, were lawfull, but what is expressely and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set downe in the scriptures, and no power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority left in the hands of Christian Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to appoint Iudges and Officers for Church. discipline, as well as for civill Iudicature.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. But to returne: as the <hi>Praefecti Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio; quia illustres erant et antestabant caeteris dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, ideo habebant Vicarios suos in civilibus causis audiendis et terminandis:</hi> So were the Bishops then, and so are they now <hi>Illustres Iudices et antestabant et antestant caeteris dignitatibus in Ecclesia.</hi> For the Law paralells them in the Church with the chiefe Iudges in the Empire, as well in this, as in the rest of the parts of their Honour, wherewith the Emperour had honoured them, and the Law honours them at this day. <hi>Iustinien's</hi> Code hath sundry lawes some of his owne, some of the Emperours before him, even from the dayes of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, which shew that Bishops, in their Episcopall Audience, sate not


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62291:27"/>
without their Chancellours; although their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours sate often without the Bishops, whose high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er charge in Christs Church permitted not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops presence in Court causes ordinarily. And though not under the name and title of Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, nor alwayes Vicars Generalls, Officials, nor Commissaries, yet they had other titles, but the same offices. <hi>Ecclesiastici</hi> or <hi>Episcoporum Ecdici,</hi> as much as to say as Church-Lawyers, or Bishops Lawyers, professed Civilians, and Canonists of that age, the very selfe-same Officers and Office that the Bishops Vicar-generalls then were, and now are. Who together with the Bishops then made, and doe now make but one and the same Tribunall and Consistory: their Commissions they held from the Bishops; but their Iurisdiction from the Law. And the cause why the Imperiall power furnished the Bishops with these Officers, was, the multitude and variety of Ecclesiasticall causes, more in that age then now, the decisions whereof in their Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, being left to the Bishops, the Emperour dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bted might have drawn them from prayer and divine exercises. And a second reason was, that the cause of the cognisance of their Courts, weremore likely to have thereby a more speedy, ready, and Iudicious triall before Iudges of the same learning, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a whole man, then before Iudges of another, though an higher, requiring (as the Bishops pastorall office doth) a whole man too. And a third reason also may be added. Because that clerkes suits, and


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62291:28"/>
quarrells should not be divulged and spread abroad amongst the secular sort, which trenched many times upon the whole profession, especially in Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall matters, wherein Princes aunciently so much tendred the Clergy, that if a Clerke had committed an offence worthy of death or open shame, whereby he became perpetually infamous, hee was not first executed or put to open shame, before hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by the Bishop and his Clergy, and so was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted and put to shame not as a Clerke, but as a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malefactour, for the Honour and dignity of <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> It were to be wished this order were retained still, that Clerks should not passe immediatly, when they fall into such excesses, from the Altar, to the halter, but hang or suffer other shame without their <hi>Priesthood:</hi> which order if it were retained still, or might be restored, would much honour the Church and no whit derogate from the Iurisdiction of the Crowne.

him the sacraments, or if he continue obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his wickednesse, by an utter exclusion of him from the fellowship and communion of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. I know none so malignant, or unskilfull in Ecclesiasticall affayres, that will deny this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which indeed goes not beyond Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have been conferred on Church-men from the beginning, by divine Institution. But in this our Church, Christian Princes have furthermore allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Clergy temporall authority; by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they inflict civill punishments on Heretiques, Schismaticks, and other despisers of the Church. As also many sage and grave Divines are in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces endowed with the publique power of Iustices of Peace. Concerning this Iurisdiction, let us enquire whether it may lawfully be granted to Church-men: which that it may lawfully be done, these following Reasons have induced me to believe.</p>
            <p>It is first to be considered, thatboth these Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <note place="margin">Argum. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> tend to the same end of promoting Iustice and bridling vice; but with this difference, that that power <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6.</note> which is meerly spirituall makes use only of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all means, whereas the weapons of civill authority be coactive, and externall, as Imprisonment, Fines, and corporall punishments. Here therefore would I know, why it should be esteemed a wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull act, not suiting to the holy function of a <hi>Priest,</hi> to correct Hereticks, Schismaticks, and other vile and notorious disturbers of the Christian Common-wealth's Peace, as well with civill and


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62291:29"/>
bodily chastisements as those of the spirit, where Power is given them so to doe. To resist and pull downe vices by either way is a good and plausible action, and of it's selfe misbeseeming no Person though never so holy. The blessed Angellsof Heaven <note place="margin">Act. 12. 23.</note> deeme it a thing in no wise contrary to their sanctity in the name and command of God to smite the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane with corporall Punishments. Why then should the Angells of the Church thinke it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 1.</note> to adjudge the same delinquents to any deserved punishments, when by the decree of their Soveraign, Gods Vice-gerent here on earth, it is so determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? For the Execution of civill Authority is not of it's selfe repugnant to any Person how holy soever, nor disagreeing to the office of <hi>Priesthood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, the high, and absolute Power of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Argum. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> perswades me that Church-men doe by good <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13. 14.</note> right exercise this Iurisdiction. For the King being, by God's appointment, the Fountaine of all civill Authority, may without offence derive some rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets thereof to what Persons he shall thinke fit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lay or Ecclesiasticall; I said but some rivelets; because, (though no Temporall office by Gods lawes are forbidden the Clergy) wisdome and equity permit not Kings so farre to burthen them with state affaires, as wholy to divert them from their spirituall <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 4.</note> Function. This Power therefore is so to be entrusted to them, as it may be an Ornament or Furtherance to the Church government, no hinderance or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle thereunto. But it is not for every vulgar judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62291:30"/>
or envious Peece to determine how farre this Iurisdiction is to be granted to the Clergy, so that it may helpe and not trouble them in their Ministery.

            <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, Because to many it seems unfitting, the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours <note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> of the Apostles should exercise an Authority which the Apostles themselves had nothing to doe with, Let us observe the difference of Times, and thence gather that this civill Iurisdiction is as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and necessary to the Divines of our Time, as it was altogether unnecessary and unprofitable to the Apostles. Civill Iurisdiction is by the chiefe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to be conferred on those that are subordinate, and according to his lawes to bee administred. As long therefore as the Rulers of the earth waged


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62291:30"/>
warre against the Truth of the Gospell, neither could they assigne, nor the Apostles without scandall to Christ and the downefall of Religion have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any Temporall Power from their hands. But since Kings and their lawes began to subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Christ, civill Authority by them given to the Ministers of Christ, might-have been a great furtherance to <hi>the advancement of the Gospell</hi> and more happy government of the Church. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the Apostles and Fathers of the primitive Church, were from heaven endowed with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and miraculous power, which did more availe to the confirmation of Christians in Faith and Obedience, then any civill Authority: But now the government of the Church is in the hands of Ordinary Ministers, who being disarmed of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and miraculous power, are conveniently guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this Temporall and Ordinary Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lastly, when the Christian Church was in her Infancy, Piety was more deepely rooted in the breasts of the Disciples, and if they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the discipline of the Church, their rebellious minds were soone quelled by the cruelty of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hourely imminent danger of violent death. But now the Christian world wholly possessed and carried away with Pride and Luxury, hath so cleane layd aside all respects of Piety and Modesty that all the spirituall power of the Clergy and Church-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, if not seconded by civill Iurisdiction, breeds rather scorne and contempt then amendment in the

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4.</note> owne Institution, and the most ancient practice of the Church. God himselfe under the law did annect civill lurisdiction to the office of <hi>Priesthood:</hi> it is therfore no strangething, nor against the divine Law, that a Church-man should beare sway in temporall affayres. <hi>Heli, Samuel,</hi> the <hi>Macchabee's,</hi> together with all the high <hi>Priests</hi> in the old Testament, did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this kind of Authority; but why it continued not so for some hundred yeares after the Gospell, is made evident by reasons above alleadged. But since <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great submitted his Imperiall Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Christ, you shall in all Ages finde the godly Bishops and Fathers of the Church administring civill Iurisdiction by Religious Emperours to them imparted: which if time would serve might be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testified, out of Ecclesiasticall Histories, and Councells, and out of the Emperour's owne lawes: but these are so sufficiently knowne to the learned, that the citation thereof would prove an unnecessary Trouble.</p>
            <p>Lastly, let us out of our adversaries owne grants <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5.</note> and confessions, prove what they themselves deny. They grant the Clergy a Iurisdiction whereby they can cite before their Courts, Hereticks, Drunkards,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62291:31"/>
Adulterers and such like infamous persons, admitac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations against them, heare and examine witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and give sentence of Excommunication on those that are lawfully convicted. If by vertue of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Iurisdiction, from Christ received, they can doe these things, why shall they not by the accession of secular Iurisdiction by the King conferred, imprison the same Malefactours, or by such like civill punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bridle their loose incontinencies? This Act of Correction is no lesse warrantable in it's owne nature then that of Excommunication: both being put in execution by just and legitimate Authority; neither doe corporall punishments lesse conduce to the Reformation of delinquents and the Churches good, then those meerly spirituall. Therefore, by the allowance of superiour Authority, it is no lesse expedient that Clergy-men should inflict one kinde of chastisement rather then another. In a word, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> doth grant that what controversies <note place="margin">Calvin. Inft. 4. 10. 11.</note> soever happened between Christians, to avoyd strife and division, they were wont to referre them to their <note place="margin">De opere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach. 29.</note> Bishops by their judgement to be decided. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us that he dayly spent some time in secular affayres, either by his sentence determining and setling them, or cutting them off by his interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; Furthermore he records that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church-men in such troublesome matters. If private Christians doe lawfully commit their civill controversies to the arbitrement of Bishops, surely Christian Kings may to the same Bishops lawfully


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62291:32"/>
commit the Iudgement of the like causes; if at the request of private men, it bee not unlawfull for Church-men to intermeddle with secular businesses, it cannot bee unlawfull to doe the same by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the King. For as the matter stands, hee doth no left interest himselfe in State-affayres, who decides controversies as an <hi>Elect Arbitratour,</hi> then he who decides the same as <hi>a Iudge ordained by the Prince.</hi> Let us conclude, that ambitiously so hunt after or with prejudice to the function of <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> to exercise civill jurisdiction, is a proud and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull act; But to accept of civill Iurisdiction from the hand of a King, and to administer the same to the better establishing of the Peace and Discipline of the Church is an act lawfull and praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, most agreeable to the ancient practise of the Church, and no wayes repugnant to the divine Scriptures.</p>
