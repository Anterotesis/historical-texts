            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The winde and weather ought also in these moneths to be regarded, especially of those whose weake constitution, is not so able to endure the cold, as others of a stronger composition of bodie. The windes that are most vnwholsome and daungerous to swimme in, is the East and North, for that blowing from cold and drie places, they bring diuers and sundrie discommodities. The weather that is to be eschewed is rayne, for these considerations, the droppes doe trouble the superficies of the water hurteth the bodie, distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the eyes, and lastly, drayning from the bancks into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, bringeth also with it, whatsoeuer dunge, strawe, leaues, and what filth or vnwholsome things else, doe lie neare adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the place.</p>
               <p>In the place is two things especially to be respected, first, that the bancks bee not ouergrowen with ranck thicke grasse,
<pb facs="tcp:11951:6"/>
where oft-times, doe lie and lurke many stinging Serpents, and poysoned Toades: not full of thornes, bryers, stubbes, or thistles, which may offend the bare feete, but that the grasse be short, thinne, and greene, the bancke beset with shadie trees, which may be a shelter from the winde, and a shadowe from the parching heate of the Sunne. Next that the water it selfe bee cleare, not troubled with any kinde of slymie filth, which is very infectious to the skinne, that the breadth, depth, and length ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be sufficiently knowne, that it be not muddie at the bottome, least by much treading the filth rising vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the bottome, thicken the water, and so make it vnfitte for that purpose. Also that there be not in the bottome of the Riuer any olde stakes or sharpe stones, which may greatly indaunger the Swimmer, but that it be a cleare running water, not a standing corrupted poole, the bottome faire sande, where from the bancks may easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, whatsoeuer doth lye in the deepest place of the Riuer. Which tyme and place, according to these rules and directions when he hath fitly selected, let him asociate himselfe with some one that is taller and stronger then himselfe, which may both comfort him, and helpe to sustaine him, for that at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, the chilnes of the water will greatly discomfort him: as also he may thereby be better directed where the water is deepe, and where it is shallowe. But if so be that he for any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie occasion, or other reason whatsoeuer, rather delight to be alone then thus, let him take a longe rod like vnto an angle, and vpon the end thereof, hange in a long small corde a plummet of lead, wherewith hee may standing vpon the bancke, sound eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place of the water, and if he cannot reach the further side with his pole, boldlie venturing so far into the water, as by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he hath experienced, he may reach further and further, vntill he hath tried it all, which if he finde correspondent in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point to the rules before rehearsed, and that there be not any suddaine or plum falling downe into any great holes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede his owne height, nor any whirlpooles, as we call them, or kinde of swift or violent streames, that may forcely carry him away, let him there practise, according to these rules following:
<pb facs="tcp:11951:6"/>
and venture not into any other vnknown place, vntill hee be a perfect practisioner in this Art. Thus much for the time &amp; place. For the maner of his going into the Riuer, it must not be swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, (a thing whereunto in the heate of So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mer men are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie subiect,) for that comming into the cold water it maketh a suddaine chaunge in body, which is very daungerous, but rather by walking easily in some coole shade, or some such other mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate meanes, let him before hee enter into the water bring his bodie into a reasonable temperature of heate and cold, and then, not as some which are more bold then wise, rudely leape into the water with their f√©ete downwarde, as this picture next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing sheweth.</p>
