         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HISTORY
OF THE

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If in time, as in place there were Degrees of
high and low; I verily believe that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of time, whould be that which passeth
betwixt, 1640, and 1660. For he that
thence as from the Divils Mountain, should
have looked upon the World, and observed
the Actions of Men, especially in <hi>England,</hi>
might have had a Prospect of all kinds of Injustice,
and of all kinds of Folly that the world could afford;
and how they were produced by then Hypocrisy
and self-conceit, whereof the one is double Iniquity,
and the other double Folly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I should be glad to behold the Prospect. you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103390:3"/>
that have lived in that time and in that part
of your Age; wherein Men used to see best
into good and evil; I pray you set me (that could
not see so well) upon the same Mountain, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the actions you then saw, &amp; of their Causes,
Pretentions, Justice, Order, Artifice and Events.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In the year, 1640. The Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was Monarchical, and the King that reigned,
<hi>Charles</hi> the I. of that Name, holding the Soveraignty
by Right of a Discent continued above 600 years;
and from a much longer Discent King of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and from the Time of his Ancestors <hi>Henry</hi> the 2.
King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Man that wanted no Vertue,
either of Body or Mind, nor endeavour'd any thing
more, than to discharge his Duty towards his God,
in the well-governing of his Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How could he than miscarry, having in every
County so many Train'd-bands, as would (put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
have made an Army of 60000 Men, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Magazenes of Ammunition, in Places fortified.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If those Souldiers had been (as they and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his Subjects ought to have been) at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Command: the Peace and Hapiness of the
Three Kingdoms, had continued, as it was left by
K. <hi>James;</hi> but the People were corrupted generally,
and Disobedient Persons esteemed the best Patriots</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B,</speaker>
               <p>But sure, there were Men enough, besides
those that were ill-affected, to have made an Army
sufficient for to have kept the People from uniting
into a Body able to oppose him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Truely, if the King had had Money, I think
he might have had Souldiers enough in <hi>England;</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103390:3"/>
for there were very few of the common People that
cared much for either of the Causes, but would
have taken any side for pay and plunder: But the
Kings treasure was very low, and his Enemies that
pretended the Peoples ease from Taxes, and other
specious things, had the Command of the Purses
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and of most Cities and
Corporate Towns in <hi>England,</hi> and of many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Persons besides.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But how comes the People to be so corrupted,
and what kind of People were they that did so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Seducers were of divers sorts. One sort
were <hi>Ministers; Ministers</hi> (as they called themselves)
of Christ; and sometimes in their Sermons to the
People, Gods Embassadors, pretending to have a
Right from God to govern every one his Parish, and
their Assembly, the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There were a very great number, though
not comparable to the other, which notwithstanding
that the Popes Power in <hi>England,</hi> both Temporal
and Ecclesiastical had been by Act of Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished,
did still retain a belief, that we ought
to be governed by the Pope, whom they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the Vicar of Christ, and in the Right of
Christ to be the Governour of all Christian People,
and these were known by the Name of <hi>PAPISTS,</hi>
as the <hi>Ministers I</hi> mentioned before, were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>PRESBYTERIANS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There were not a few, who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Troubles were not discovered, but
shortly after declared themselves for a Liberty in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103390:4"/>
Religion, and those of different opinions one from
another: Some of them (because they would have
all Congregations free and independant upon one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother)
were called <hi>INDEPENDANTS;</hi> others
that held Baptism to Infants, and such as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not into what they are Baptized to be ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
were called therefore <hi>ANABAPTISTS:</hi>
Others that held, that Christs Kingdom was at this
time to begin upon the Earth, were called <hi>FIFTH-MOMARCHY-MEN;</hi>
besides divers other Sects
as <hi>QUAKERS, ADAMITES,</hi> &amp;c. whose names
and peculiar Doctrines I do not very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and these were the Enemies, which arose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Majesty from the private Interpretation
of the Scripture exposed to every Mans scanning
in his Mother Tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There were an exceeding great number
of Men of the better sort, that had been so edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
as that in their youth having read the Books
written by famous men of the Antient <hi>Grecian</hi> and
<hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealths, concerning their Policy
and great Actions, in which Book the Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was extold by that glorious Name of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and Monarchy disgraced by the Name of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
they became thereby in love with their form
of Government: And out of these men were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
the greatest part of the <hi>HOUSE OF COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS:</hi>
or if they were not the greatest part, yet
by advantage of their Eloquence were always able
to sway the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The City of <hi>London,</hi> and other great
Towns of Trade, having in admiration the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103390:4"/>
of the low Countries, after they had revolted
from their Monarch, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to think, that the like change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here would to them produce the like prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There were a very great Number, that
had either wasted their fortunes, or thought them
too mean for the good part? they thought were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
themselves: and more there were that had able bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and saw no means how honestly to get their
Bread: These longed for a War, and hoped to
maintain themselves hereafter by the lucky chusing
of a Party to side with, and consequently did for
the most part serve under them, that had greatest
plenty of Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> The People in general were so ignorant
of their Duties, as that not one perhaps of 1000
knew what Right any man had to command him, or
what necessity there was of King or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
for which he was to part with his money
against his will, but thought himself to be so much
Master of whatsoever he possest, that it could not
be taken from him upon any pretence of Common
Safety without his own consent. <hi>King,</hi> they thought
was but a Title of the highest honour, which <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
Knight, Baron, Earl, Luke</hi> were but steps
to ascend to with the help of Riches, and had no
Rule of Equity, but Precedents and Custom, and
he was thought wisest and fittest to be chosen for a
Parliament, who was most averse to the granting
of Subsidies, or other publick Payments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In such a Constitution of People, methinks the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103390:5"/>
King is already outed of his Government: so as
they need not have taken Arms for it: For I cannot
imagine, how the King should come by any means
to resist them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>There was indeed very great difficulty in the
business, but of that point you will be better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the pursuit of this Narration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But I desire to know first the several grounds
of the Pretences, both of the <hi>Pope</hi> and of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi>
by which they claim a Right to govern
us, as they do in chief, and after that, from whence,
and when crept in the Pretences of that <hi>Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
for a <hi>Democrasie.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>As for the <hi>Papists,</hi> they challenge this Right
from a Text in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and other like Texts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

<hi>And he that out of Pride shall refuse to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment

upon pain of Death: Again, whereas in the <hi>New

in Heaven and in Earth, go therefore and teach all
Nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and teach
them to observe all those things, that I have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

of the Apostles was to be obeyed, &amp; by consequence
the Nations were bound to be governed by them,

               <p>For the Text in the Old Testament, I do not
see how the Commandment of God to the <hi>Jews</hi> to
obey their Priests can be interpreted to have the like
force in the Case of other Nations Christian, more
then upon Nations Unchristian: For all the world
are Gods People, unless we also grant, that a King
cannot of an Infidel be made Christian without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himself subject to the Laws of that Apostle or
Priest, or Minister, that shall convert him. The
<hi>Jews</hi> were a peculiar People of God, a Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Kingdom, and bound to no other Law, but what
first <hi>Moses,</hi> and afterwards every High Priest did go
and receive immediately from the Mouth of God
in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in the Tabernacle of the Ark, and in
the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> of the Temple. And for the
Text in St. <hi>Mathew:</hi> I know the words in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
are not, <hi>Go teach,</hi> but <hi>Go and make Disciples;</hi>
and that there is a great difference between a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and a Disciple, and between teaching and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding;
and if such Texts as these must be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
why do not Christian Kings lay down
their Titles of Majesty and Soveraignty, and call
themselves the <hi>Popes</hi> Lieutenants? But the Doctors
of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> seem to decline that Title of
<hi>Absolute Power,</hi> in their distinction of <hi>Power Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>

               <p>For my part I should rather obey that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

the Pope saith it is) that he that dies Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

               <p>You say true; for it were very Uncharitable

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103390:7"/>
think them also Damn'd, and he that is Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

an other Case, and bringeth no such danger with

               <p>But what is this Heresie which the Church

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Heresie is a word, which when it is used
without Passion, signifies a private Opinion: so the
different Sect of the Old Philosophers, <hi>Academians,
Peripateticks, Epicureans, Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ks,</hi> &amp;c. were called
Heresie: But in the Christian Church, there was
in the signification of that word, comprehended a
sinful opposition to him that was chief Judge of
Doctrines in order to the Salvation of mens Souls;
and consequently Heresie may be said to bear the
same Relation to the power Spiritual, that Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth to the power Temporal, and is sutably to
be persecuted by him that will preserve a power
Spiritual, and Dominion over mens Consciences.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It would be very well (because we are all of
us permitted to read the Holy Scriptures, and
bound to make them the Rule of our Actions both
publick and private) that Heresie were by some
Law defined, and the particular Opinions set forth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103390:8"/>
for which a man were to be condemned and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Hereticks; for else, not only men of mean
capacity, but even the wisest and devoutest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may fall into Heresie, without any will to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Church; for the Scriptures are hard, and
the interpretations different of different men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning of the word Heresy is by Law
declared in an Act of Parliament, in the First Year
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> wherein it is ordained, that
the Persons who had by the Queens Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
the Authority Spiritual (meaning the High
Commission) shall not have Authority to Adjudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Matter or Cause to be Heresy, but only such as
heretofore have been Adjudged to be Heresy, by
the Authority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by the
First 4. General Counsels, or by any other General
Council, where the same was declared Heresy by
the express and plain words of the said Canonical
Scripures or such as hereafter shall be adjudged
Heresy, by the High Court of Parliament of this

               <p>It seems therefore, if there arise any new Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
that hath not been yet declared Heresy, (&amp; many
such may arise) it cannot be Judged Heresy without
a Parliament; for how foul soever the error be, it
cannot have been declared Heresy, neither in
the Scriptures nor in the Councils, because it was
never before heard of; and consequently, there
can be no Error unless it fall within the compass of
Blasphemy against God, or Treason against the King)
for which a Man can in Equity be punished: Besides
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103390:8"/>
who can tell what is declared by the Scripture,
which every man is allowed to read and interpret to
himself? nay more what <hi>Protestant,</hi> either of the

or the same Doctrines taught by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <sp>

               <p>I see by this, that both the Calling of the

Church Government had no obligatory force, but
from the Authority of the Emperor; how comes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103390:9"/>
it then to pass, that they take upon them now a
Legislative Power, and say their Canons are Laws?
That Text, <hi>all Power is given to me in Heaven and

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>They say no; for the Power they pretend to is
derived from this, that when a King was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Gentilism</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> he did by that
very Submission to the <hi>Bishop</hi> that converted him,
submit to the <hi>Bishops</hi> Government, and became one
of his sheep, which Right therefore he could not
have over any Nation, that was not Christian.</p>

               <p>Did <hi>Silvester</hi> (which was <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the

tell the Emperor his New Disciple before hand, that
if he became a Christian he must be the <hi>Popes</hi> Subject.</p>

               <p>I believe not, for it is likely enough, if he had
told him so plainly, or but made him suspect it, he
would either have been not Christian at all, or but a

               <p>But if he did not tell him so, and that plainly, it
was foul play, not only in a Priest, but in any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
And for this Derivation of their Right from the

               <p>When began the <hi>Popes</hi> to take this Authority
upon them first?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>After the Inundation of Northern People had
overflowed the Western Parts of the Empire, and
possessed themselves of <hi>Italy,</hi> the People of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Rome</hi> submitted themselves, as well in <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi>
as <hi>Spirituals</hi> to their <hi>Bishop;</hi> and then first was
the <hi>Pope</hi> a Temporal Prince, and stood no more in
so great fear of the Emperors, which lived far off
at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> In this time it was that the <hi>Pope</hi>
began by pretence of his <hi>Power Spiritual,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon the <hi>Temporal Rights</hi> of all other <hi>Princes</hi>
of the West, and so continued gaining upon them,
till his Power was at the highest, in that 300 years
or thereabout, which passed between the time of
<hi>Pope Leo</hi> the 3. and <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the 3. For in this
time <hi>Pope Zachary</hi> 1. deposed <hi>Chilperick,</hi> then King
of <hi>France,</hi> and gave the Kingdom to one of his
Subjects <hi>Pepin:</hi> And <hi>Pepin</hi> took from the <hi>Lombards</hi>
a great part of their Territory, and gave it to the
Church: shortly after the <hi>Lombards</hi> having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their Estate, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great retook it, and
gave it to the Church again, and <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the 3.
made <hi>Charles</hi> Emperor.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But what Right did the <hi>Pope</hi> there pretend for
the creating of an Emperor?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He pretended the Right of being Christs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,
and what Christ could give, his Vicar, might
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103390:10"/>
give, and you know that Christ was King of all the
World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, as God, and so he gives all the Kingdoms
of the World, which nevertheless, proceed from
the consent of People either for fear, or hope.</p>

               <p>But this Gift of the Empire was in a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Manner, in such a Manner, as <hi>Moses</hi> had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Israel</hi> given him, or rather as <hi>Joshua</hi>
had it given him, to go in and out before the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as the <hi>High Priest</hi> should direct him, and so
the Empire was understood to be given him on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be directed by the <hi>Pope:</hi> for when the <hi>Pope</hi>
inuested him with the Regal Ornaments, the People
all cryed out <hi>Deus dat,</hi> that is to say, 'tis God that
gives it: and from that time all, or most of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kings do put into their Titles the words <hi>Dei
gratia,</hi> that is by the gift of God: and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
use still to receive the Crown and Scepter
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom a Bishop.</p>
               <p>'Tis certainly a very good Custom for Kings to
be put in mind by whose gift they reign, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
from that Custom be infer'd, that they receive
the Kingdom, by mediation from the <hi>Pope,</hi> or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Clergy: for the <hi>Popes</hi> themselves received
the Papacy from the <hi>Emperor,</hi> the first that ever
was elected Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Emperors</hi> were
<hi>Christians,</hi> and without the <hi>Emperors</hi> consent excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself by Letter to the <hi>Emperor;</hi> with this, that
the People and Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> forced him to take
it upon him, and prayed the <hi>Emperor</hi> to confirm it,
which the <hi>Emperour</hi> did but with Reprehension of
their Proceedings and prohibition of the like for the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103390:10"/>
time to come the <hi>Emperour</hi> was <hi>Lotharius,</hi> and
the <hi>Pope Calixtus</hi> the first.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You see by this the Emperour never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
this gift of God was the gift of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> but maintained the <hi>Popedom</hi> was the gift of
the <hi>Emperour;</hi> but in process of time by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of the <hi>Emperour</hi> (for the greatness of <hi>Kings</hi>
makes them that they cannot easily descend into
the obscure and narrow Mines of an ambitious
Clergy,) they found means to make the people
believe, there was a Power in the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Clergy:</hi>
which they ought to submit unto, rather than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Commands of their own <hi>King</hi> whensoever
it should come into Controversy, and to that end
devised and decreed many new Articles of Faith,
to the diminution of the Authority of <hi>Kings,</hi> and
to the disjunction of them and their Subjects, and
to a closer adherence of their Subjects to the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Articles, either not at all found
in, or not well founded upon the Scripture, as
first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it should not be lawful for a <hi>Priest</hi> to
Marry. What influence could that have upon the
Power of <hi>Kings?</hi> do you not see that by this, the
<hi>King</hi> must of necessity either want the <hi>Priesthood,</hi>
and therewith a great part of the Reverence due
to him from the most Religious part of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or else want lawful Heirs to succeed in? by
which means being not taken for the Head of the
<hi>Church,</hi> he was sure in any Controversy between
Him and the <hi>Pope,</hi> that his Subjects would be
against him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Is not a Christian <hi>King</hi> as much a <hi>Bishop</hi> now,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103390:11"/>
as the Heathen <hi>Kings</hi> were of old? for amongst
them <hi>Episcopus</hi> was a name common to all <hi>Kings;</hi>
Is not he a <hi>Bishop</hi> now, to whom God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the charge of all the Souls of his Subjects,
both of the <hi>Laity</hi> and of the <hi>Clergy?</hi> And though
he be in relation to our Saviour who is the chief
Pasture of Sheep, yet compared to his own Subjects,
they are all Sheep, both <hi>Laick</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> and
he only Shepheard, and seeing a Christian <hi>Bishop</hi>
is but a Christian indued with power to govern
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> it follows that every Christian <hi>King</hi> is
not only a <hi>Bishop</hi> but an <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and his whole
<hi>Kingdom</hi> his <hi>Diocess;</hi> and though it were granted
that Imposition of Hands were necessary for a
<hi>Priest,</hi> yet seeing <hi>Kings</hi> have the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>Clergy</hi> that are the Subjects, even
before Baptism, the Baptism it self wherein he is
received as a Christian is a sufficient Imposition
of Hands, so that whereas before, he was a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
now he is a Christian <hi>Bishop.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>For my part I agree with you, this Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of Marriage to <hi>Priests</hi> came in about the
time of <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>William</hi> the
First <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by which means the <hi>Pope</hi>
had in <hi>England,</hi> what with Secular, and what with
Regular <hi>Priests,</hi> a great many lusty Batchelers at
his Service. Secondly, That <hi>Auricular Confession</hi>
to a <hi>Priest</hi> was necessary to Salvation. 'Tis true,
that before that time, Confession to a <hi>Priest</hi> was
usual, and performed for the most part (by him
that Confessed) in writing, but that use was taken
away about the time of <hi>King Edward</hi> the Third,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103390:11"/>
and <hi>Priests</hi> commanded to take Confessions from
the Mouth of the Confitent; and men did generally
believe, that without <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Absolution</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their departure out of the World they could
not be saved, and having <hi>Absolution</hi> from a <hi>Priest</hi>
they could not be damned. You understand by
this how much every man would stand in awe of
the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> more than they would of the
<hi>King,</hi> and what inconveniency it is for a State to
have their Subjects confess their secret thoughts
to Spies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, as much as Eternal Torture is more
terrible than Death, so much they would fear the
<hi>Clergy</hi> more than the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>And though perhaps the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> will
not maintain that a <hi>Priest</hi> hath power to remit
Sins absolutely, but only with a condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
yet the people were never so instructed
by them, but were left to believe that whensoever
they had Absolution their precedent Sins were all
discharged, when their Penance, which they took
for Repentance, was performed; in the same time
began the Article of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> for it had
been disputed a long time before, in what manner
a man did eat the Body of our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
as being a point very difficult for a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and imagine clearly, but now it was made
very clear that the <hi>Bread</hi> was <hi>Transubstantiated</hi>
into <hi>Christs Body,</hi> and so was become no more
<hi>Bread,</hi> but <hi>Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It seems then that <hi>Christ</hi> had many <hi>Bodies,</hi>
and was in as many places at once as there were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103390:12"/>
Communicants, I think the <hi>Priests</hi> then were so
wanton as to insist upon the dulness, not only of
common people, but also of Kings and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I am now in a Narration, not in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and therefore, I would have you at this
time to consider nothing else but what effect this
Doctrine would work upon Kings and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in relation to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who only were able
of a piece of <hi>Bread</hi> to make our <hi>Saviours Body,</hi> and
thereby at the hour of death to save their Souls.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>For my part it would have an effect on me
to make me think them Gods, and to stand in
awe of them as of God himself, if he were visibly
present.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Besides these and other Articles tending to
the upholding of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority, they had
many fine points in their Ecclesiastical Policy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to the same end: of which I will mention
only such as were established within the same
time; for then it was the Order came up of
<hi>Preaching-Friars,</hi> that wandred up and down with
power to Preach in what Congregation they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and were sure enough to instil into the people
nothing that might lessen their obedience to the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but on the contrary, whatsoever
might give advantage to it against the Civil
Power, besides they privately insinuated themselves
with Women and Men of weak judgments; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
their adherence to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and urging
them in the time of their sickness to be beneficial
to it by contribution of Money, or building Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103390:12"/>
Houses, or works of Piety, and necessary
for the remission of their Sins.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I do not remember that I read of any
Kingdom or State in the World, where liberty
was given to any private man to call the people
together and make Orations frequently to them,
or at all, without first making the State acquainted,
except only in <hi>Christendom:</hi> I believe the Heathen <hi>K.</hi>
foresaw that a few such Orators would be able to
make a great Sedition, <hi>Moses</hi> did indeed command
to read the Scriptures, and expound them in the
<hi>Synagogues</hi> every <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, but the Scriptures
then were nothing else, but the Laws of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
delivered unto them by <hi>Moses</hi> himself, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it would do no hurt if the Laws of <hi>England</hi>
also were often read and expounded in the several
Congregations of <hi>English-men</hi> at times appointed,
that they may know what to do; for they know
already what to believe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think that neither the Preaching of <hi>Friers,</hi>
nor <hi>Monks,</hi> nor of <hi>Parochial Priests,</hi> tended to teach
men what, but whom, to believe; for the Power of
the <hi>Mighty</hi> hath no foundation, but in the opinion
and belief of the people, and the end which the
<hi>Pope</hi> had in multiplying Sermons was no other,
but to prop and enlarge his own Authority over
all Christian Kings and States.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Within the same time, <hi>that is,</hi> between the
time of the Emperour <hi>Charles the Great</hi> and of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third of <hi>England,</hi> began their
second Policy, which was to bring Religion into
an Art, and thereby to maintain all their Degrees
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103390:13"/>
of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> by Disputation, not only from
the Scriptures, but also from the Phylosophy of
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> both Moral and Natural, and to that
end the <hi>Pope</hi> exhorted the said Emperour by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to erect Schools of all kinds of Literature, and
from thence, began the Institution of Universities,
for not long after the Universities began in <hi>Paris,</hi>
and in <hi>Oxford:</hi> It is true that there were Schools
in <hi>England</hi> before that time, in several places, for
the instruction of Children in the Latine Tongue;
that is to say, in the Tongue of the <hi>Church,</hi> but
for an University of Learning there was none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
till that time, though it be not unlikely
there might be then some that taught <hi>Philosophy,
Logick,</hi> and other Arts, in divers Monastries, the
<hi>Monks</hi> having little else to do but to study. After
some Colledges were built to that purpose, it was
not long before many more were added to them
by the Devotion of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> and other
wealthy men and the Dicipline therein was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the <hi>Popes</hi> that then were, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Scholars sent thither by their friends to
study, as to a place from whence the way was open
and easy to preferment both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
The profit the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them, and in effect received, was the
Maintenance of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Doctrine, and of his
Authority over Kings and their Subjects, by
School Divines, who striving to make good many
points of Faith incomprehensible, and calling in
the Phylosophy of <hi>Aristotle</hi> to their assistance,
wrote great Books of School Divinity, which no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103390:13"/>
man else, nor they themselves were able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
as any man may conceive that shall consider
the writing of <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> or <hi>Scotus,</hi> or of
him that wrote Commentaries upon him, or of
<hi>Suarez,</hi> or of any other School Divines of later
times, which kind of Learning nevertheless hath
been much admired by two sorts of men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
prudent enough; The one of which sorts
were those that were already Devoted, and
really affectionate to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> for they
believed the Doctrine before, but admired the
Arguments, because they understood them not,
and yet found the Conclusions to their mind; The
other sort were negligent men, that had rather
admire with others, than take the pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
so that all sorts of people were fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that both the Doctrine was true, and the
<hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority no more then what was due to
him. I see that a Christian King, or State, how
well soever provided he be, of Money and Arms,
(where the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath such authority)
will have but a hard match of it, for want of men;
for their Subjects will hardly be drawn into the
Field, and fight with courage against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is true that great rebellions have been
raised by <hi>Church-men</hi> in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s quarrel against
<hi>Kings,</hi> as in <hi>England</hi> against <hi>King John,</hi> and in
<hi>France</hi> against <hi>King Henry</hi> the Fourth, wherein
the <hi>Kings</hi> had a more considerable part on their
sides, than the <hi>Pope</hi> had on his, and shall always
have so, if they have money; for there are but few,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103390:14"/>
whose Consciences are so tender as to refuse money
when they want it, but the great mischief done to
<hi>Kings</hi> upon pretence of Religion, is when the <hi>Pope</hi>
gives power to one <hi>King</hi> to Invade another.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder how <hi>King Henry</hi> the Eighth so
utterly extinguished the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> and that without any Rebellion at
home, or any Invasion from abroad?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Priests, Monks,</hi> and <hi>Friars,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the heighth of their Power, were now,
for the most part grown insolent and licentious,
and thereby the force of their Arguments was
now taken away by the scandal of their lives,
which the Gentry, and men of good education,
easily perceived, and the Parliament consisting of
such persons, were therefore willing to take away
their Power, and generally the Common people
which for a long time had been in love with
Parliaments were not displeased therewith. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
The Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> beginning a little
before, was now by a great many men of the greatest
Judgments so well received, as that there was no
hope to restore the <hi>Pope</hi> to his Power by Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Revenue of the <hi>Abbies</hi> and
all other <hi>Religious Houses,</hi> falling hereby into the
<hi>Kings</hi> hands, and by him being disposed of to the
most eminent Gentlemen in every County, could
not but make them do their best to confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the possession of them. <hi>Fourthly, King
Henry</hi> was of a nature quick, and severe in the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of such as should be the first to oppose his
designs. <hi>Lastly,</hi> As to Invasion from abroad, if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103390:14"/>
the <hi>Pope</hi> had given the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to another <hi>Prince,</hi>
it had been in vain, for <hi>England</hi> is another manner
of <hi>Kingdom</hi> than <hi>Navarre,</hi> besides the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Spanish</hi> Forces were imployed at that time one
against another, and though they had been at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
they would have found perhaps no better
success than the <hi>Spaniard</hi> found afterwards in 1588.
Nevertheless, notwithstanding the Insolence, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
and Hypocrisy of the then <hi>Clergy,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi>
had not provoked the <hi>King</hi> by endeavouring to
cross his Marriage with his second Wife, his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
might have remained in <hi>England</hi> till there
had risen some other quarrel.</p>

or Doctrine, and that the <hi>Clergy</hi> afterwards did
read it, (being perhaps written in Shorthand) by
a mistake to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s advantage <hi>Regalia.</hi> Did
not (I say) the <hi>Bishops</hi> oppose that Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

their Jurisdiction Episcopal in the Right of God,
as immediately as the <hi>Pope</hi> himself did exercise
the same over the whole <hi>Church;</hi> and because
they saw that by this Act of the King in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and never thought of holding it of
the <hi>King,</hi> they were perhaps better content, to let
the Act of Parliament pass in the reign of <hi>King
Edward</hi> the Sixth, the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> had
taken such great root in <hi>England</hi> that they threw
out a great many of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s new Articles of

               <p>I confess this Licence of Interpreting the
<hi>Scripture</hi> was the cause of so many several Sects, as
have lain hid till the beginning of the late King's
Reign, and did then appear to the Disturbance of
the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> but to return to the Story,
Those persons that fled for <hi>Religion</hi> in the time of
<hi>Queen Mary,</hi> resided, for the most part, in places
where the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> was professed and
Governed by an <hi>Assembly of Ministers,</hi> who also
were not a little made use of (for want of better
<hi>Statesmen)</hi> in points of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> which
pleased so much the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch Protestants</hi>
that lived amongst them, that at their return they
wished there were the same Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
given to the <hi>Ministry</hi> in their own Countries,
and in <hi>Scotland (King James</hi> being then young)
soon (with the help of some of the powerful No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility)
they brought it to pass; also they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>England</hi> in the beginning of the Reign
of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> endeavoured the same here,
but could never effect it till this last <hi>Rebellion,</hi> nor
without the help of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and it was no sooner
effected but it was defeated again by the other
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103390:17"/>
                  <hi>Sects,</hi> which by the preaching of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
and private Interpretation of <hi>Scripture,</hi> were grown
numerous.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I know indeed, that in the beginning of the
late War, the Power of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> was so
very great, that not onely the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London</hi>
were, almost all of them, at their <hi>Devotion;</hi> but
also the greatest part of all other Cities and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
Towns of <hi>England:</hi> But you have not yet told
me by what Art and what Degrees they became
so strong.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It was not their own Art alone that did it, but
they had the Concurrence of a great many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that did no less desire a <hi>Popular Government</hi>
in the <hi>Civil State</hi> than these <hi>Ministers</hi> did in the
<hi>Church;</hi> and as these did in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> draw
the People to their Opinions and to a dislike of
the <hi>Church Government, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Common Prayer
Book,</hi> so did the other make them in love with
<hi>Democracie</hi> by their <hi>Harangues</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
and by their Discourse and Communication with
people in the Country, continnually extolling of
<hi>Liberty,</hi> and inveighing against <hi>Tyrany,</hi> leaving
the people to collect of themselves, that this <hi>Tyrany</hi>
was the present Government of the <hi>State:</hi> and as the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> brought with them into their <hi>Churches</hi>
their <hi>Divinity</hi> from the <hi>Universities,</hi> so did many
of the Gentlemen bring their <hi>Politicks</hi> from thence
into the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but neither of them did this
very boldly in the time of <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> and though it
be not likely that all of them did it out of malice, but
many of them out of error, yet certainly the Chief
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103390:17"/>
leaders were ambitious <hi>Ministers</hi> and ambitious
Gentlemen, the Ministers envying the Authority of
Bishops, whom they thought less Learned. And
the Gentlemen envying the Privy Council whom
they thought less wise than themselves; for 'tis a
hard matter for men who do all think highly of
their own Wits (when they have also acquired the
Learning of the University) to be perswaded that
they want any Ability requisite for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Commonwealth, especially having read
the Glorious Histories, and the Sententious Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
of the Ancient Popular Government of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> amongst whom Kings were hated
and branded with the name of Tyrants; and Popular
Government (though no Tyrant was ever so cruel
as a Popular Assembly) passed by the name of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers in the beginning of
the Reign of <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> did not (because they durst
not) Publickly Preach against the Discipline of the
Church, but not long after (by the favour perhaps
of some great Courtier) they went abroad Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in most of the Market Towns of <hi>England</hi> (as
the Preaching Fryers had formerly done) upon
working days in the morning; in which these and
others of the same Tenets; that had charge of Souls
both by the Manner and Matter of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
applied themselves wholly to the winning of
the People, to a likeing of their Doctrines, and
good Opinion of their Persons.</p>
               <p>And first for the manner of their Preaching, They
so framed their Countenance and Gesture at the
entrance into the Pulpit, and their Pronunciation,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103390:18"/>
both in their Prayer and Sermon; and used the
Scripture phrase, whether understood by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or not, as that no Tragedian in the World
could have Acted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the part of a right godly man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then these did, insomuch that a man unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with such Art could never suspect any Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Plot in them, to raise Sedition against the
State, as they then had designed, or doubt that
the Vehemence of their Voice (for the same words
with the usual Pronunciation had been of little
force) and forcedness of their Gesture and Looks
could arise from any thing else but zeal to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God. And by this Art they came into such
credit, that numbers of men used to go forth of
their own Parishes and Towns on working days,
leaving their Calling; and on Sunday leaving their
own Churches to hear them Preach in other places,
and to Despise their own and all other Preachers
that acted not as well as they. And as for those
Ministers that did not usually Preach, but instead
of Sermons did read to the People such Homilies as
the Church had appointed; they esteemed and
called them <hi>Dumb Dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the matter of their Sermons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Anger of the People in the late <hi>Roman</hi>
Usurpation was then fresh; they saw there could
be nothing more gracious with them then to Preach
against such other Points of the Romish Religion as
the Bishops had not yet condemned, that so receding
farther from Popery then they did, they might with
Glory to themselves leave a Suspition on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
as men not yet well purged from Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:103390:18"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> before their Sermons their Prayer was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or seemed to be <hi>ex tempore,</hi> which they pretended
to be dictated by the Spirit of God within them,
and many of the People believed or seemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, or any man might see that they did not
take care before hand, what they should say in their
Prayers: And from hence came a dislike of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer-Book,</hi> which is a set form praemedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
that men might see to what they were to say,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They did never in their Sermons, or
but lightly inveigh against the Lucrative vices of
Men of Trade or Handicraft, such as are faining,
lying, couzening, Hypocrisie, and other uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
(except want of Charity to their Pastor, and
to the faithful, which was a great ease to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Citizens, and the Inhabitants of <hi>Market
Towns,</hi> and no little profit to themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> by preaching up an opinion, that men
were to be assured of their Salvation, by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of their own <hi>private Spirit,</hi> meaning the
Holy Ghost; dwelling within them: And from this
opinion, the People, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound in themselves a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
hatred towards the <hi>Papists,</hi> and an ability to
repeat the Sermons of these men at their coming
home made no doubt, but that they had all that was
necessary, how fraudulently and spitefully soever
they behaved themselves to their Neighbours, that
were not reckoned amongst the Saints, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to those also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> They did indeed with great earnestness,
and severity inveigh often against two Sins, Carnal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103390:19"/>
Lust, and vain Swearing, which without question was
very well done, but the Common People were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
inclined to believe, that nothing else was Sin,
but that which was forbidden in the <hi>3d.</hi> and <hi>7th.</hi>
Commandment: for few men do understand by the
Name of Lust any other Concupiscence than that
which is forbidden in the 7 Commandment: for men
are not ordinarily said to lust after another Mans
Catle, or other goods or possessions, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made much Scruple of the Acts of Fraud &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
but endeavoured to keep themselves from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaness
only, or at least from the Scandal of it; and
whereas they did both in their Sermons and writings
maintain and inculcate, that the very first motions of
the Mind, that is to say the delight Men and Women
took in the sight of one anothers Form, though they
checked the proceeding therof, so that it never grew
up to be a Design, was nevertheless a Sin; they
brought Young Men into Desperation and to think
themselves damn'd because they could not (which no
man can, and is contrary to the Constitution of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
behold a delightful Object without Delight;
and by this means they became Confessors to such as
were thus troubled in Conscience, and were obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, as these Spiritual Doctors in all Cases
of Conscience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, divers of them did preach frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Oppression.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Tis true, I had forgot that, but it was before
such as were free enough from it, (I mean) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, who would easily believe themselves
oppressed, but never Oppressors: And therefore
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103390:19"/>
you may reckon this amongst their Artificers, to
make their People beleive they were oppressed by
the <hi>King,</hi> or perhaps by the <hi>Bishops</hi> or both, and
inclined the meaner sort to their Party afterward
when there should be occasion; but this was but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
done in the time of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> whose fear and
Jealousie they were afraid of: nor had they as yet
any great Power in the Parliament House, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to call in question her Prerogative by Petitions
of Right, and other Devices as they did afterwards
when Democratical Gentlemen had received them
into their Council, for the design of changing the
Monarchical Government into Popular, which they
called Liberty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Who could think that such Horrible Designs
as these could so easily and so long remain, covered
with the Cloak of Godliness; for that they were
most Impious Hypocrites is manifest enough, by
the War these preceedings ended in, and by the
Impious Act in the War committed? But when
began first to appear in Parliament the attempt of
Popular Government and by whom?</p>

               <p>As to the time of attempting the change of
Government from Monarchical to Democratical,
we must distinguish: They did not challenge the
Soveraignty in plain terms, and by that name, till
they had slain the King; nor the Rights thereof,
altogether, by particular Heads, till the King
was driven from <hi>London</hi> by Tumults raised in the
City against him, and retired for the security of his
Person to <hi>York,</hi> where he had not been many days
when they sent unto him Nineteen Propositions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103390:20"/>
whereof above a Dozen were Demands of several
Powers, Essential parts of the Power Soveraign,
but before that time they had demanded some of
them (in a Petition which they called <hi>a Petition of
Right)</hi> which nevertheless the King had granted
them in a former Parliament: though he deprived
himself thereby, not only of the Power to Levy
Mony without their consent, but also of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Revenue by Custome of Tonnage and Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and of the Liberty to put into Custody such

that did this, 'tis enough to say, they were the
Members of the last Parliament, and of some
other Parliaments in the beginning of the Reign of
King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the end of the Reign of King
<hi>James:</hi> To name them all is not necessary, farther
then the Story shall require; most of them were
Members of the House of Commons, some few
also of the Lords: But all such as had a great Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their sufficiency in Politicks which they
thought was not sufficiently taken notice of by
the King.</p>

               <p>How could the Parliament, when the King
had a great Navy, and a great number of Train'd

be sure should not be enough to maintain his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

of imposing upon the <hi>Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thought) of the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> sent
down a <hi>Book of Common Prayer</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> not
differing in substance from ours, nor much in words,
besides the putting of the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> for that of
<hi>Minister,</hi> commanding it to be used (for Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to this <hi>Kingdom)</hi> by the ministers there, for
an ordinary form of <hi>Divine Service;</hi> this being
read out the Church at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> caused such a
Tumult there, that he that read it had much adoe
to escape with his life, and gave occasion to the
greatest part of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and others, to enter
(by their own Authority) into a <hi>Covenant</hi> amongst
themselves to put down <hi>Episcopacy</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
the <hi>King,</hi> which they presently did, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103390:21"/>
thereto by their own Confidence, or by assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from some of the <hi>Democratical English men,</hi>
that in former <hi>Parliaments</hi> had been the greatest
opposers of the <hi>King</hi>'s interest, that the <hi>King</hi> would
not be able to raise an Army to chastise them
without calling a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which would be sure
to favour them, for the thing which those <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticals</hi>
chiefly then aimed at, was to force the
<hi>King</hi> to call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which he had not done
of ten years before, as having found no help, but
hinderance, to his designs in the <hi>Parliaments</hi>
he had formerly called. Howsoever contrary to
their expectation by the help of his better affected
Subjects of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> he made a
shift to raise a sufficient Army to have reduced
the <hi>Scots</hi> to their former obedience, if it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to Battle: And with this Army he marched
himself into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was
also brought into the Field against him, as if they
meant to fight; but then the <hi>Scotch</hi> sent to the
<hi>King</hi> for leave to treat by <hi>Commissioners</hi> on both
sides, and the King willing to avoid the destruction
of his own Subjects condescended to it, the issue
was Peace, and the <hi>King</hi> thereupon went to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
and passed an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> there to
their Satisfaction.</p>

               <p>No, but yielded to the abolishing of it,
but by the means the <hi>English</hi> were crossed in their
hope of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> but the <hi>Democraticals,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
opposers of the <hi>King</hi>'s Interest, ceased not
to endeavour still to put the two Nations into a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103390:21"/>

               <p>But what was the Cause that the <hi>Gentry</hi>
and <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> were so averse from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy?</hi>
For I can hardly believe that their
Consciences were extraordinarily tender, nor
that they were so very great <hi>Divines</hi> as to know
what was the true <hi>Church Discipline</hi> established by
our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> nor yet so much in
love with their <hi>Ministers</hi> as to be over-ruled by
them in the Government either <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> or
<hi>Civil,</hi> for in their lives they were just as other men
are, Pursuers of their own Interests and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein they were not more opposed
by the <hi>Bishops</hi> than by their <hi>Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>

               <p>Truly I do not know, I cannot enter into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens thoughts farther than I am lead by the
consideration of <hi>Human Nature</hi> in general: But
upon this consideration I see. <hi>First,</hi> That men
of antient Wealth and Nobility are not apt to
brook, that poor Schollars should (as they must
when they are made <hi>Bishops</hi>) be their Fellows. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
That from the emulation of Glory between
the <hi>Nations,</hi> they be willing to see their <hi>Nation</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with <hi>Civil War,</hi> and might hope by aiding the
Rebels here to acquire some Power over the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish;</hi>
at least so far as to establish here the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Discipline, which was also one of the points they
afterwards openly demanded. <hi>Lastly,</hi> They might
hope for in the War some great sum of money as a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103390:22"/>
reward of their assistance, besides great Booty which
they afterwards obtained, but whatsoever was the
cause of their hatred to <hi>Bishops,</hi> the pulling of them
down was not all they aimed at; if it had (now
that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was abolished by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi>
they would have rested satisfied, which they
did not; for after the <hi>King</hi> was returned to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
the <hi>English Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Democraticals,</hi>
by whose favour they had put down <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
thought it reason to have the assistance of
the <hi>Scotch</hi> for the pulling down of <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and in order thereunto, they might perhaps
deal with the <hi>Scots</hi> secretly to rest unsatisfied with
that pacification which they were before contented
with, howsoever it was, not long after the <hi>King</hi>
was returned to <hi>London</hi> they sent up to some of
their friends at <hi>Court</hi> a certain Paper containing
(as they pretended) the Articles of the said Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
a false and Scandalous Paper, which was
by the <hi>King</hi>'s Command burnt (as I have heard)
publickly, and so both parts returned to the same
Condition as they were in when the <hi>King</hi> went
down with his Army.</p>

a man Valiant and Wise enough, but he perished
in the imployment. And to come home to our

Expedition to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> but his Son sent afterwards
to the same place could do nothing. 'Tis but a

this War (if they had given Money as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meant to do) had come too late; it is true
there was mention of a sum of Money to be given
the <hi>King</hi> by way of Bargain, for relinquishing his

but so seldom, and without determining

that time he was come to <hi>York</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army
was drawn up to the Frontiers, and ready to march
into <hi>England,</hi> (which also they presently did)
giving out all the way, that their march should be
without damage to the Country, and that their
Errand was onely to deliver a Petition to the <hi>King</hi>
for the redress of many pretended Injuries they
had received from such of the Court whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel

where they found some little opposition from a
party of the <hi>King</hi>'s Army sent thither to Stop
them, whom the <hi>Scots</hi> easily mastered, and as soon
as they were over, seized upon <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and
coming farther on, upon the City of <hi>Duresme,</hi> and
sent to the <hi>King</hi> to desire a Treaty, which was
granted, and the Commissioners on both sides met at
<hi>Rippon,</hi> the conclusion was that all should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the <hi>Parliament</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> should
call to meet at <hi>Westminster</hi> the third of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>

they had not yet sufficiently disgraced him in

him those they thought could best counsel him,

therefore they resolved to proceed with him like
skilfull hunters, First to single him out by men
disposed in all parts to drive him into the open field,
and then in case he should not seem to turn head
to call that making a War against the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
And first, They called in question such as had either
Preached, or written, in defence of those Rights
which belonging to the <hi>Crown</hi> they meant to usurp,
and take from the <hi>King</hi> to themselves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

or forced to fly: The King not protecting
these, they proceeded to call in question some of the
King's own Actions in his Ministers, whereof they
Imprisoned some, and some went beyond Sea, and
whereas certain persons having endeavoured by
Book and Sermons to raise Sedition, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
other Crimes of high Nature, had therefore
been censured by the Kings Council in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi>
and Imprisoned; the <hi>Parliament</hi> by their

Persons were inconsiderable) ordered their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the defence of

besides it were unreasonable that a corrupt or

foolish Judge's unjust Sentence should by any
time, how long soever, obtain the authority and
force of a Law, but amongst the <hi>Statute Laws</hi>
there is one called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or <hi>The great
Charter of the Liberties of English men,</hi> in which
there is one Article that no man shall be distrained,
that is, have his Goods taken from him otherwise

               <p>No, that leaves us in the same doubt which
you think it clears; for, where was the Law of the
Land then? Did they mean another <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
that was made by some <hi>King</hi> more antient yet?
No, that Statute was made not to exempt any man
from payments to the Publick, but for securing of
every man from such as abused the King's Power
by surreptitious obtaining of the King's Warrants,
to the oppressing of those against whom he had
any Suite in Law: but it was conducing to the
end of some rebellious Spirits in this Parliament,
to have it interpreted in the wrong sense, and
suitable enough to the understanding of the rest,

that signify nothing, but serve only to astonish
the multitude of ignorant men: as for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Readers they were so few, that these new

these School men were to make good all the
Articles of Faith which the <hi>Pope</hi> from time to time
should command to be believed: Amongst which
there were very many inconsistent with the Rights
of <hi>Kings,</hi> and other Civil <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> as asserting

thought fit to have believ'd because they bring some

even to the meanest of them; for when they

of God, and concerning the Estate of Mans
Soul after Death in Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory,
by which you and every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man knows how great
Obedience, and how much Mony they gain from
the Common People: whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> holdeth
the Soul of Man to be the first giver of Motion to
the Body, and consequently to it self: they make
use of that in the Doctrine of Free Will, what and
how they gain by that, I will not say.</p>
               <p>He holdeth forth, that there be many things that
come to pass in this World, from no necessity of

and to be a meer Spectator in the Games of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
for what God is the cause of must needs come
to pass. And in my Opinion nothing else: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there must be some Ground for Justice of the
Eternal Torment of the Damned; perhaps it is
this, That mens Wills and Propensions are not
(they think) in the hands of God, but of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

               <p>This is not much, nor was <hi>Aristotle</hi> of such

enough to be possible from the Almighty Power of

at the same time; if the Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation

The end of Moral Philosophy, is to teach men
of all sorts their Duty, both to the Publick, and
to one another. They Estemate Virtue partly by a
Mediocrity of the Passions of Men, and partly by
that, that they are praised; whereas it is not the much
or little praise that makes an Action Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ous, but
the Cause; nor much or little Blame that makes an
Action Vitious, but its being unconformable to the
Laws, in such men as are subject to the Law; or
its being unco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ormable to Equity or Charity in all
men whatsoever.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It seems you make a difference between the
<hi>Ethicks</hi> of <hi>Subjects,</hi> and the <hi>Ethicks</hi> of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So I do: The Vertue of a <hi>Subject</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
wholly in obedience to the Laws of the
Commonwealth. To obey the Laws is Justice and
Equity, which is the Law of Nature, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is Civil Law in all Nations of the World;
and nothing is Injustice or Iniquity, otherwise then
it is against the Law: likewise to obey the Law is
the Prudence of a <hi>Subject;</hi> for without such obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
the Commonwealth (which is every <hi>Subjects</hi>
Safety and Protection) cannot subsist. And though
it be Prudence also in private men, justly and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
to enrich themselves; yet craftily to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
from the Publick, or defraud it of such part
of the Wealth as is by Law required, is no sign
of Prudence, but of want of knowledge of what
is necessary for their own defence.</p>
               <p>The Vertues of Soveraigns are such as tend to
the maintenance of Peace at Home, and to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103390:32"/>
Resistance of Forreign Enemies. Fortitude is a
Royal Vertue, and though it be necessary in such
private men as shall be Soldiers; yet for other
men the less they dare the better it is, both for the
Commonwealth, and for themselves. Frugality
(though perhaps you will think it strange) is also
a Royal Vertue, for it increases the publick stock,
which cannot be too great for the Publick Use, not
any man too sparing of what he has in trust for
the good of others. Liberality also is a Royal
Vertue, for the Commonwealth cannot be well
serv'd without Extraordinary Diligence and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Ministers, and great Fidelity to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
who ought therefore to be incouraged
and especially those that do him service in the
Wars. In summ, all Actions or Habits are to be
esteemed Good or Evil, by their Causes and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in reference to the Commonwealth, and not
by their <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> nor by their being Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for several men praise several Customes, and
that which is vertue with one, is blam'd by others
and contrarily, what one calls Vice, an other calls
Vertue as their present Affections lead them.</p>

the time of the late Troubles, as of their Causes,
and of the Counsels, and Artifices by which they
were brought to pass. There be divers men that
have Written the History, out of whom I might
have Learned what they did, and somewhat also of
the Contrivance: but I find little in them of it. I
would ask therefore, since you were pleased to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into this Discourse at my request; be pleased
also to inform me after my own method. And
for the danger of Confusion that may arise from
that, I will take care to bring you back to the place

               <p>Well then, to your Question concerning

               <p>There is no Nation in the World, whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is not Established, and receives not its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the Laws of that Nation. It is true that
the Law of God receives no obedience from the
Laws of Men; but because men can never by their
own Wisdom come to the knowledge of what God
hath spoken and Commanded to be Observed, nor
be obliged to obey the Laws, whose Author they
know not; they are to acquiess in some humane
Authority or other: So that the Question will be,
Whether a man ought in matter of Religion, (that
is to say) when there is question of his Duty to God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103390:33"/>
and the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to rely upon the Preaching of their

            <sp>

               <p>There is no great difficulty in that point, for
there is none that Preach here, or any where else,
at least ought to Preach, but such as have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
so to do, from him or them that have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power: So that if the King give us leave, you
or I may as lawfully Preach as them that do, and I
believe we should perform that Office a great deal
better than they, that preached us into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>

               <p>The Church Morals are in many points very

Conscience to be false, which is the Faith that they
require: I could name a great many more such
Points of their Morals, but that I know you know
them already, being so well versed in the cases

Holy, the Word Preached, and the Lords Supper

the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> fail in that?</p>

               <p>Why so, They kept some Holy Days, and
they had Feasts among themselves, though not upon
the same Days that the Church Ordains, but when
they thought fit, as when it pleased God to give
the King any notable Victory, and they govern'd
themselves in this point by the Holy Scriptures, as
they pretend to be; and can prove they did not
believe so.</p>

               <p>They will say they did it in obedience to
God, inasmuch as they did believe it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Scripture, out of which they will bring
perhaps examples of <hi>David</hi> and his Adherents, that
resisted King <hi>Saul,</hi> and of the Prophets afterwards
that vehemently from time to time Preached
against the Idolatrous Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,
Saul</hi> was their Lawfull King; and yet they
Paid him neither Active nor Passive obedience; for
they did put themselves into a posture of defence
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103390:35"/>
against him, though <hi>David</hi> himself spared his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and so did the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> put into their
Commission to their <hi>General,</hi> that they should spare
the <hi>Kings-Person;</hi> besides, you cannot doubt but
that they who in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> did animate the <hi>People</hi>
to take Arms in defence of the then <hi>Parliament,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
Scripture, that is the <hi>Word</hi> of God for it; if it
be lawful then for Subjects to resist the K. when he
Commands any thing against the Scripture, that is
contrary to the Command of God, and to be Judge
of the meaning of the Scripture it is impossible, that
the Life of any King, or the Peace of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kingdom can be long secure: It is this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that divides a Kingdom within it self, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the men be Loyal or Rebels, that Write or

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I see it, and wonder at People, that having
never spoken with God Almighty, nor knowing one
more than another, what he hath said, when the
Laws and the Preacher disagree, should so keenly
follow the Minister, for the most part an ignorant,
though a ready tongu'd Scholar, rather than the
Laws that were made by the King, with the consent
of the Peers and the Commons of the Land.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Let us examine his words a little nearer; First
concerning passive Obedience, when a Thief hath
broken the Laws, and according to the Law, is
therefore executed, can any Man understand, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103390:36"/>
this suffering of his is an obedience to the Law?
Every Law is a Command to do or to forbear,
neither of these is fulfilled by suffering, If any suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
can be called obedience, it must be such as
is voluntary; for no involuntary Action can be
counted a submission to the Law. He that means
that his suffering should be taken for obedience,
must not only not resist, but also not fly, nor hide
himself to avoid his punishment. And who is there
among them that discourses of passive obedience,
when his life is in extream danger, that will volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
present himself to the Officers of Justice.
Do not we see that all Men when they are led to
execution, are both bound and guarded, and would
break loose if they could and get away? Such is
their passive Obedience Christ saith, <hi>the Scribes
and Pharisees sate in</hi> Moses <hi>Chair, all therefore
whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do,
Mat.</hi> 23. 3. which is a doing an active Obedience,
and yet the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> appear not by
the Scripture to have been such Godly men, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to command any thing against the Revealed
will of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Must Tyrants also be obeyed in every thing
actively, or is there nothing wherein a Lawful
Kings Commands may be disobeyed, what if he
should command me with my own hands to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
my Father, in Case he should be Condemned
to Dye by the Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This is a Case that need not be put, We
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103390:36"/>
never have read nor heard of any King or Tyrant
so inhumane as to command it; if any did, we
are to consider whether that Command were one
of his Laws, for by disobeying Kings, we mean
disobeying his Laws, those his Laws that were
made before they were applied to any particular
person for the <hi>King</hi> though as a Father of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and a Master of domestick Secrets, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the people in general never but by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Law, and as a Publick not a Natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and if such a Command as you speak of were
contrived into a general Law (which never was,
nor never will be) you were bound to obey it,
unless you depart the <hi>Kingdom</hi> after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Law,</hi> and before the Condemnation of
your Father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You Author says farther in refusing Active
obedience to the <hi>King</hi> that Commanded any thing
contrary to God's Law, we must be very well
assured that the thing is so contrary, I would
sain know how is it possible to be assured?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think you do not believe, that any of those
Refusers do immediately from God's own Mouth
receive any Command contrary to the Command
of the King, who is God's Lieutenant, nor any
other way than you and I do, that is to say, than
by the Scriptures, and because men do for the
most part rather draw the Scripture to their own
sense, then follow the true sense of the Scripture,
there is no other way to know certainly, and in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103390:37"/>
all cases, what God Commands or forbids us to
do, but by the sentence of him, or them, that
are constituted by the King to determine the sence
of the Scriptures upon hearing of the particular
Case of Conscience which is in question: and
they that are so constituted are easily known in
all <hi>Christian Commonwealths,</hi> whether they be
<hi>Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> or <hi>Assemblies</hi> that Govern
the <hi>Church</hi> under him, or them that have the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Some doubts may be raised from this that
you now say; for if men be to learn their Duty
from the sentence which other men shall give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the meaning of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and not from
their own Interpretation, I understand not to what
end they were Translated into <hi>English,</hi> and every
man not only permitted, but also exhorted, to read
them; for what could that produce but diversity
of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and consequently (as man's nature is)
<hi>Disputation,</hi> breach of <hi>Charity, Disobedience,</hi> and
at last <hi>Rebellion?</hi> Again since the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were
allowed to be read in <hi>English,</hi> why were not the
Translations such as might make all that's read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
even by mean Capacities? Did not the
<hi>Jews,</hi> such as could read, understand their <hi>Law</hi>
in the <hi>Jewish Language</hi> as well as we do our <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Laws</hi> in <hi>English?</hi> and as for such places of
the <hi>Scripture</hi> as had nothing of the Nature of a
<hi>Law,</hi> it was nothing to the Duty of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
whether they were understood or not, seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is punishable but the Transgression of some
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103390:37"/>
Law; The same question I may ask concerning
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> for I believe that those Men
to whom the Original Language was natural did
understand sufficiently what Commands and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
were given them by our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and his immediate Disciples: Again how will
you answer that question which was put by St. <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>St. John, Acts 4. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>

               <p>The Case is not the same, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
had seen and daily conversed with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and
by the Miracles he wrote did know he was God,
and consequently knew certainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> their Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the <hi>High Priests</hi> present command was
just. Can any <hi>Minister</hi> now say that he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God's own Mouth received a
Command to disobey the <hi>King,</hi> or know other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than by the Scripture, that any Command of
the King that hath the form and nature of a Law is,
against the Law of God, which in divers places he
directly and evidently Commandeth to obey him
in all things. The Text you cite doth not tell us
that a <hi>Minister's</hi> Authority, rather than a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
King's</hi> shall decide the questions that arise
from the different Interpretations of the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
And therefore, where the <hi>King</hi> is head of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and by consequence (to omit that the
<hi>Scripture</hi> it self was not receieved but by the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103390:38"/>
Authority of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>States)</hi> chief Judge of the
<hi>Rectitude</hi> of all Interpretations of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to
obey the <hi>King's Laws</hi> and publick <hi>Edicts</hi> is not
to disobey, and obey God, a <hi>Minister</hi> ought not to
think that his Skill in the <hi>Latine, Greek,</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Tongues,</hi> if he have any, gives him a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to impose upon all his Fellow-subjects his
own sense, or what he pretends to be his sense of
every obscure place of Scripture, nor ought he, as
often as he hath found some fine Interpretation
not before thought on by others, to think he had
it by inspiration as fine as he thinks it, is not false;
and then all his Stubornness and Contumacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>King</hi> and his Laws is nothing but Pride
of heart and Ambition or else Imposture, And
whereas you think it needless, or perhaps hurtful
to have the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> I am of another
mind, There are so many places of <hi>Scripture</hi> easily
to be understood, that teach both true Faith and
good Morality, and that as fully as is necessary to
Salvation, of which no Seducer is able to dispose
the mind of any ordinary Readers, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that <hi>Covetousness is the Root of all Evil,</hi> but he

they that pretermitting the easiy places, that teach

without the <hi>Universities</hi> as well <hi>Bishops</hi> as inferiour
<hi>Clerks</hi> did think that the pulling down of the <hi>Pope,</hi>

them, but that their spiritual power did depend not
upon the Authority of the King but of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

that this derivation passed through the hands of

               <p>I think it a very good course, and perhaps the
only one that can make our peace amongst our
selves constant: for if Men know not their Duty,
what is there that can force them to obey the

Army, were not the <hi>Train'd Bands</hi> an Army?
Were they not the <hi>Janisaries</hi> that not very long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go

I am therefore of your opinion, both that
Men may be brought to a love of Obedience by
Preachers and Gentlemen that imbibe good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in their Youth at the Universities; and also
that we never shall have a lasting peace, till the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
themselves be in such manner (as you have
said) reformed, and the Ministers know they have
no Authority but what the supream Civil Power
gives them: and the Nobility and Gentry know,
that the Liberty of a State is not an Exemption
from the Laws of their own Countrey, whether
made by an Assembly, or by a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but an
Exemption from the constraint and Insolence of
their Neighbours.</p>

drew you to this long digression; We were upon

which the Parliament exclaimed against, as Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

King <hi>James</hi> sent a <hi>Divine</hi> or two, but it came
to nothing, the question was left undecided,
and became a Subject to be disputed of in the
<hi>Universities;</hi> here all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were of
the same mind with <hi>Gomar,</hi> but a very great many
others not, and those were called here <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
who because the Doctrine of <hi>Free-will</hi>
had been exploded as <hi>Papistical,</hi> and because
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were far the greater number,
and already in favour with the People, they were
generally hated; it was easy therefore for
the <hi>Parliament</hi> to make that Calumny pass

forbidden all Ministers to Preach
to the People of <hi>Predestination</hi> and when all
<hi>Ministers</hi> that were gracious with him, and
hoped for any Church-preferment fell to
Preaching and Writing for <hi>Free-will</hi> to the
uttermost of their Power, as a proof of their
Abillity and Merit. Besides they gave out,
some of them, that the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> was in
heart a <hi>Papist,</hi> and in case he could effect

raise all the Controversies: For, what man is
he that will trouble himself, and fall out with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103390:45"/>
his Neighbours for the saving of my Soul, or
the Soul of any other than himself? When
the <hi>Presbyterian Ministers,</hi> and others, did so
furiously Preach <hi>Sedition,</hi> and animate men to
<hi>Rebellion</hi> in these late Wars. Who was there
that had not a Benefit, or having one, feared not
to loose it, or some other part of his Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
by the alteration of the Government,
that did voluntarily, without any eye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Preach so earnestly against <hi>Sedition,</hi> As
the other party Preached for it? I confess that
for ought I have observed in History and other
Writings of the <hi>Heathens, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi>
that those <hi>Heathens</hi> were not at all short of
us in point of Vertue and Moral Duties, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that we have had much Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

considering what harm might proceed form a
Liberty that Men have upon every <hi>Sunday,</hi>
and oftner, to Harangue all the People of a
Nation at one time, whilst the State is ignorant
what they will say, and that there is no such
thing permitted in all the World out of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi>
nor therefore any Civil Wars about
<hi>Religion;</hi> I have thought much Preaching an
inconvenience, nevertheless I cannot think that
Preaching to the People the points of their
Duty both to God and Man can be too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
so it be done by Grave, Discreet, and
Antient men that are Reverenced by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not by light quibling young men
whom no Congregation is so simple as to look
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103390:45"/>
to be taught by, (as being a thing contrary to

them with such Acclamations, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Adoration, as if they had been let down

the King of such Ministers, as by their
Courage, Wisdom and Authority they thought
most able to prevent, or oppose their further

               <p>The <hi>Grievances</hi> were commonly such as
these; the Kings too much Liberality to some
favorite: The too much power of any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of State or Officer, the Misdemeanours of
Judges Civil or Spiritual, but especially all
Unparliamentary raising of Mony upon the
Subjects. And commonly of late till such
grievances be redressed, they refuse, or at

with Mony necessary for the most urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions

               <p>'Tis true, but they have not often dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
so much to the danger of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
as they have done in this Parliament of
1640. In all the Parliaments of the late King
<hi>Charles</hi> before the year 1640. my Lord of
<hi>Strafford</hi> did appear in opposition to the Kings
Demands, as much as any man, and was for
that Cause very much esteemed and cried up by
the People as a good Patriot, and one that
couragiously stood up in defence of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and for the same cause was so much the
more hated, when afterwards he endeavoured
to maintain the Royal and Just A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>How came he to change his mind so

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>After the Dissolution of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
holden in the year 1627 and 1628, the
King finding no Mony to be gotten from Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he was not to buy with the
Blood of such Servants and Ministers as he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
best, abstained a long time from calling any
more, and had abstained longer, if the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> had not forced him to it.
During that Parliament the King made Sir
<hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> a Baron, recommended to
him for his great ability, which was generally
taken notice of by the disservice he had done
the King in former Parliaments, but which
might be usefull also for him in the times that
came on, and not long after that he made him
of the Counsel, and again Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which place he discharged with great
satisfaction and benefit to his Majesty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in that Office till by the Envy and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Lords and Commons of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Parliament of 1640. he died, in which
year he was made General of the Kings Forces
against the <hi>Scotch</hi> that then entred into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the year before Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
The Pacification being made, and the Forces
on both sides Disbanded, and the Parliament

               <p>There was no great probability of his being

a Traitor to the King, from whose favour he had

he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Many Articles were drawn up against
him, but the summ of them was contained in
these two, First, That he had traiterously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to subvert the Fundamental Laws
and Government of the Realm, and instead
thereof to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government against Law. Secondly, That
he had laboured to subvert the Rights of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and the Antient course of Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Proceedings.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was this done by him without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why then if it were Treason, did not
the King himself call him in Question by his
Attorney? What had the House of Commons
to do without his Command to accuse him to
the House of Lords? They might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
to the <hi>King,</hi> if he had not known it
before, I understand not this Law.</p>

               <p>Had this been by any former Statutes

            <sp>

               <p>Not that I ever heard of; nor do I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that any thing can be Treason against
the <hi>King,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> hearing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
does not think Treason: But it was a
piece of that Parliaments Artifice to put the
word Traiterously to any Article exhibited
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103390:48"/>
against a man whose life they meant to take
away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was there no particular Instance of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or words out of which they argued, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of his, to subvert the fundamental
Laws of Parliament whereof they accused him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, they said he gave the King Counsel
to reduce the Parliament to their duty by the
<hi>Irish</hi> Army, which not long before my Lord of
<hi>Strafford</hi> himself had caused to be leavied there
for the <hi>Kings</hi> service; but it was never proved
against him, that he advised the <hi>King</hi> to make
use of it against the Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What are those Laws that are called
fundamental? for I understand not how one
Law can be more fundamental than another,
except only that Law of Nature that binds us all
to obey him whosoever he be, whom lawfully
and for our own safety wee have promised to
obey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any other fundamental Law to a <hi>King</hi>

his People.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This Parliament in the use of these words
when they accused any Man never regarded
the signification of them, but the weight they
had to aggravate their accusation to the Ignorant
multitudes which think all faults heinous that
are exprest in heinous termes: If they hate the
Reason accused as they did this Man not only
for being of the <hi>Kings</hi> party, but also for desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103390:48"/>
by <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Government, which they seemed
so much to hate: Is there any Governour of a
People in the World that is forced to Govern
them, or forced to make this and that Law
whether he will or no! I think, or if any be
that forces him, does certainly make Laws and

               <p>That is true, and the true meaning of the

               <p>'Twas not well done, and yet (as it seems)
not ignorantly, for there is a clause in the Bill,
that it should not be taken hereafter for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,

he was counselled to give way to his <hi>Execution,</hi>
not only by such as he most relied on, but also

               <p>Why did the <hi>Scots</hi> think there was so

he was not a Man of War, nor a Man

               <p>That did not appear by any remarkable
events of his Councils, I never heard but he
was a very honest man for his Morals; and a
very zealous promoter of the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Bishops, and that he desired to have
the Service of God performed, and the House
of God adorned as suitably as was possible, to
the honour we ought to do to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.
But to bring, as he did, into the State
his Former Controversies, I mean his squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in the University about Free Will, and
his standing upon Punctilio's concerning the
Service-Book and its Rubricks was not (in my
opinion) an Argument of his sufficiency in
Affairs of State. About the same time they
passed an Act (which the King consented
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103390:52"/>
to) for a Triennial Parliament, wherein was
Enacted, That after the present Parliament,
there should be a Parliament call'd by the
King within the space of three years, and so
from three years to three years to meet at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>

to cite all the Antient Authors that speake

were amongst our first <hi>Ancesters,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> and

from them any Arguments of Right, but
only examples of fact, which by the Ambition
of <hi>Potent Subjects</hi> have been oftner unjust then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
and for those <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> that
in Antient times by several Invasions made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of this Nation, they were not in
themselves one Body of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> but
only a League of Divers <hi>Petty German Lords</hi>
and states such as was the <hi>Graecian</hi> Army in the
<hi>Trojan War,</hi> without other Obligations, than
that which proceeded from their own fear and
weakness; nor were these <hi>Lords</hi> for the

And therefore it was not without Equity, that
when they had conquer'd any part of the Land,
and made some one of them King thereof,
the rest should have greater Priviledges than the
Common People and Souldiers, amongst which
Priviledges a man may easily conjecture this to
to be one; That they should be made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and be of Council with him that hath the
Soveraignty in matters of Government, and have
the greatest and most honourable Offices, both
in Peace and War: But because there can be
no Government where there is more than one
Soveraign, it cannot be inferr'd that they had a
Right to oppose the Kings Resolutions by force,
nor to enjoy those honours and places longer
than they should continue good Subjects: And
we find that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great occasion call them together by the
name of Discreet and Wise men of the Kingdom,
and hear their Councils, and make them Judges
of all Causes that during their Sitting were
brought before them. But as he summon'd
them at his own pleasure; so had he also ever
at his pleasure power to Dissolve them. The
<hi>Normans</hi> also that Descended from the <hi>Germans,</hi>
as we did, had the same Customs in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and by this means, this Priviledge have the
Lords to be of your Kings great Council; and
when they were assembled, to be the highest of
the Kings Court of Justice, continued still after
the Conquest to this day. But though there be
amongst the Lords divers Names or Titles of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103390:55"/>
Honour, yet they have their Priviledge by the
only name of Baron, a name receiv'd from the
Antient <hi>Gauls,</hi> amongst whom that name signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the King's Man, or rather one of his great
Men: By which it seems to me, that though
they gave him Council when he requir'd it, yet
they had no Right to make War upon him, if he
did not follow it.</p>

or the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third,
immediately after the mis behaviour of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons;
and for ought any man knows, were called
on purpose to weaken that Power of the Lords,
which they had so freshly abused. Before the
time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Lords were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
most of them from such as in the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Conquests of the <hi>Germans</hi> were Peers
and Fellow Kings, till one was made King of
them all, and their Tenants were their Subjects,
as it is at this day with the Lords of <hi>France.</hi> But
after the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make Lords in the place of them, whose
Issue fail'd Titularly only; without the Lands
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103390:55"/>
belonging to their Title; and by that means
their Tenants being bound no longer to serve
them in the Wars, they grew every day less
and less able to make a Party against the King,
though they continued still to be his Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:
And as their Power decreased, so the Power
of the House of Commons increased: But I do
not find that they were part of the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at all, nor Judges over other men, though it
cannot be denied but a King may ask their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
as well as the advice of any other. But I
do not find that the end of their summoning was
to give advice; but only in case they had any
Petitions for Redress of Grievances, to be ready
there with them whilst the King had his Great
Council about him.</p>
               <p>But neither they, nor the Lords, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the King as a Grievance; That the King
took upon him to make the Laws, to chuse his
own Privy Council, to raise Money and Souldiers,
to defend the Peace and Honour of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to make Captains in his Army, to make Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of his Castle whom he pleased; for
this had been to tell the King that it was one of
their Grievances that he was King.</p>

               <p>What did the Parliament do whilst the

               <p>The King went in <hi>August;</hi> after which the
Parliament <hi>September</hi> the 8th. adjourn'd till the
20th. of <hi>October,</hi> and the King return'd about
the end of <hi>November</hi> following, in which time
the most Seditious of both Houses, and which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103390:56"/>
had Designed the Change of Government, and
to cast off Monarchy (but yet had not wit
enough to set up another Government in its
place, and consequently lest it to the Chance of
War) made a Cabal amongst themselves, in which
they projected how by seconding one another
to Govern the House of Commons; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
how to put the Kingdom by the Power
of that House into a Rebellion, which they then
called a posture of Defence against such Dangers
from abroad as they themselves should feign
and publish. Besides, whilst the King was in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists got togeter a great
Party, with an Intention to Massacre the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
there, and had laid a Design for the
seizing of <hi>Dublin</hi> Castle <hi>October</hi> the 20th.
where the King's Officers of the Government of
the County made their Residence, and had effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, had it not been Discovered the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
The Manner of the Discovery, and the
Murders they committed in the Country after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I need not tell you, since the whole

               <p>I wonder they did not expect &amp; provide for
a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> as soon as they began to
quarrel with the King in <hi>England:</hi> For was
there any body so ignorant as not to know that
the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists did long for a Change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
there, as well as the Presbyterians in
<hi>England?</hi> Or that in general the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation
did hate the name of Subjection to <hi>England,</hi> or
would longer be quiet than they feared an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103390:56"/>
out of <hi>England</hi> to chastize them? What bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time then, could they take for their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
than this, wherein they were encouraged,
not only by our weakness caused by this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
between the King and his Parliament, but
also by the Example of the Presbyterians, both
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Nation? But what did
the Parliament do upon this occasion in the
King's absence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing; but consider what use they
might make of it to their own ends; partly by
imputing it to the King's evil Councillors, and
partly by occasion thereof to demand of the
King the Power of Pressing and Ordering of
Souldiers, which Power whosoever has, has also
without doubt the whole Soveraignty.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He came back the 25th. of <hi>November,</hi> and
and was welcomed with the Acclamations of the
Common People, as much as if had been the
most beloved of the Kings before him, but found
not a Reception by the Parliament answerable to
it: They presently began to pick new Quarrels
against him out of every thing he said to them.
<hi>December</hi> the 2d. the King called together both
Houses of Parliament, and then did only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
unto them the raising of Succours for
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What Quarrel could they pick out of
that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>None but in order thereto, as they may
pretend, they had a Bill in Agitation to assert
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103390:57"/>
the power of Levying &amp; Pressing Souldiers to the
two Houses of the Lords and Commons; which
was as much as to take from the King the Power
of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which is in effect the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power; for he that hath the Power of
Levying, and Commanding of the Souldiers, has
all other Rights of Soveraignty which he shall
please to claim: The King hearing of it, called
the Houses of Parliament together again on <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
the 14th. and then pressed again the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as there was need) for all this
while the <hi>Irish</hi> were murdering the <hi>English</hi> in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and strengthening themselves against
the Forces they expected to come out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
and withall told them, he took notice of
the Bill in Agitation for Pressing of Souldiers;
and that he was content it should pass with a
<hi>Salvo Jure</hi> both for him and them, because the
present time was unreasonable to dispute it
in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What was there unreasonable in this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing; what's unreasonable is one
question; what they quarrelled at is another:
They quarrelled at this, that His Majesty took
notice of the Bill while it was in debate in the
House of Lords, before it was presented to him,
in the Course of Parliament: And also that he
shewed himself displeased with those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
the third Bill; both which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be against the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and petitioned the King to give them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
against those by whose evil Council he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103390:57"/>
was induced to it, that they might receive
condign punishment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This was cruel proceeding: Do not the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> use to sit in the Lords House
when they please? And was not this Bill then in
debate in the House of Lords? It is a strange
thing that a man should be lawfully in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of men, where he must needs hear and see
what they say and do; and yet must not take
notice of it, so much as to the same Company;
for though the King was not present at the
Debate it self, yet it was lawful for any of the
Lords to make him acquainted with it. Any one
of the House of Commons, though not present
at a Proposition, or Debate, in the House, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
hearing of it from some of his fellow-Members,
may certainly, not only take notice
of it, but also speak to it in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:
But to make the King give up his
Friends and Councillors to them to be put to
Death, Banishment or Imprisonment, for their
good will to him, was such a Tyranny over a
King, no King ever exercised over any Subject,
but in cases of Treason, or Murder, and seldom
then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Presently hereupon grew a kind of War
between the Peers of Parliament, and those of
the Secretaries, and other able Men that were
with the King. For upon the 15th. of <hi>December</hi>
they sent to the King a Paper called a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
of the Sate of the Kingdom, and with it
a Petition, both which they caused to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103390:58"/>
in the Remonstrance they complained of
certain mischievous Designs of a Malignant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then before the beginning of the Parliament
grown ripe, and did set forth what means had
been used for the preventing of it by the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Parliament; what Rubs they had
found therein, what course was fit to be taken
for the restoring and establishing the Antient
Honour, Greatness and Safety of the Crown and
Nation: And of those Designs the Promoters
and Actors were, they said,</p>
               <p>1. Jesuits and Papists.</p>
               <p>2. The Bishops, and part of the Clergy, that
cherish Formality as a support of their own Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Tyranny and Usurpation.</p>
               <p>3. Councillors and Courtiers, that for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ends (they said) had engaged themselves to
farther the Interests of some Forein Princes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It may well be, that some of the Bishops,
and also some of the Court may have, in pursuit
of their private Interest, done something in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly,
and perhaps wickedly; therefore I
pray to tell me particularly what their Crimes
were; for methinks the King should not have
conniv'd at any thing against his own Supream
Authority.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Parliament were not very keen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them that were against the King. They
made no doubt but all they did was by the
King's Command, but accused thereof the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Councillors and Courtiers, as being a more
mannerly way of Accusing the King himself, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103390:58"/>
and defaming him to his Subjects. For the truth
is, the Charge they brought against them was
so general, as not to be called an Accusation, but
Railing. As first; They said, they nourished
Questions of Prerogatives and Liberty between
the King and his People, to the end, that seeming
much addicted to His Majesties Service, they
might get themselves into places of greatest
Trust and Power in the Kingdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How could this be call'd an Accusation, in
which there is no Fact for any Accusers to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their Proof to, or their Witnesses? for,
granting that these Questions of Prerogative
had been moved by them, who can prove that
their End was to gain to themselves and Friends
the Places of Trust and Power in the Kingdom?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>A second Accusation was, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to suppress the Purity and Power of
Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That's Canting. It is not in Mans power
to suppress the Power of Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They meant, that they supprest the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Presbyterians; that is to say, the
very Foundation of their Parliaments Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Pretensions.</p>
               <p>A third; That they cherished Arminians, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and Libertines (by which they meant the
common Protestants that meddle not with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes)
to the end they might compose a body
fit to Act according to their Counsels and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
               <p>A fourth; That they endeavoured to put the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103390:59"/>
King upon other courses of Raising Money, than
by the ordinary way of Parliaments. Judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these may be properly called Accusations,
or not rather spightful Reproaches of the King's
Government.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks this last was a very great fault;
for what good could there be in putting the
King upon any odd course of getting Money
when the Parliament was willing to supply him
as far as to the security of the Kingdom, or to
the honour of the King should be necessary?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But I told you before they would give
him none, but with a Condition he should cut off
the heads of whom they pleased, how faithfully
soever they had serv'd him; and if he would
have sacrificed all his Friends to their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet they would have found other excuses
to deny him Subsidies; for they were resolv'd to
take from him the Soveraign Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which they would never do without
taking great care that he should have no Money
at all. In the next place, they put into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
as faults of them whose Council the
King followed, All those things which since the
beginning of the King's Reign were by them
mis-liked, whether faults or not, and whereof
they were not able to judge for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Causes and Motives that induced
the King to do them, and were known only to
the King himself, and such of his Privy-Council
as he revealed them to.</p>

faults?</p>

people for Mis-government; and for faults of
the King's, though some of them were Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
and both the Mis-fortunes and the
Mis-government (if any were) were the faults
of the Parliament, who by denying to give
him Money, did both frustrate his Attempts
abroad, and put him upon those extraordinary
waies (which they call Illegal) of raising Money
at home.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You see what a heap of Evils they have
raised to make a shew of ill Government to the

of the many services they have done the King
in overcoming a great many of them, though
not all, and in divers other things, and say, that
though they had contracted a Debt to the <hi>Scots</hi>
of 22000 <hi>l.</hi> and granted six Subsidies, and a Bill
of Pole-money worth six Subsidies more, yet that
God had so blessed the Endeavours of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that the Kingdom was a gainer by it;

things they had done for the King and Kingdom:
For the Kingdom they had done (they said)

                  </gap> money,
They had taken away Coat and Conduct-money,
and other Military Charges, which they said
amounted to little less than the Ship-money;
That they supprest all Monopolies, which they
reckoned above a Million yearly sav'd by the
Subject; That they had quell'd Living Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
meaning, Evil Councillors and Actors by

by the Imprisonment of the Arch-Bishop

the Continuance of the present Parliament, till
they should think fit to Dissolve themselves.</p>

But the summe of all those things which
they had done for the Kingdom, is, that they
had left it without Government, without
Strength, without Money, without Law, and
without good Council.</p>

               <p>They reckoned also putting down of the
High Commission, and the abating of the Power
of the Council-Table, and of the Bishops, and
their Courts; the taking away of unnecessary
Ceremonies in Religion; removing of Ministers
from their Livings, that were not of their

               <p>The Good they had done the King was,

            <sp>

               <p>What need of Relief had the Northern

            <sp>

               <p>Yes, In the Northern Counties were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, which the Parliament
call'd in to oppose the King, and consequently
their Quarter was to be discharged.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>True, but by the Parliament that call'd
them in.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But they say no; and that this Money was
given the King, because he is bound to protect
his Subjects.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>He is no farther bound to that, than they
to give him Money wherewithal to do it. This
is very great Impudence, to raise an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, and with that Army to oppress
their Fellow-subjects, and then require that the
King should relieve them; that is to say, be at
the Charge of Paying the Army that was raised
to fight against him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nay farther, they put to the King's Accompts
the 30000 <hi>l.</hi> given to the <hi>Scots,</hi> without which
they would not have Invaded <hi>England;</hi> besides
many other things that I now remember not.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You have not observ'd the world long
enough to see all that's ill: Such was their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as I have told you; with it they
sent a Petition containing three points.</p>
               <p>First, That His Majesty would deprive the
Bishops of their Votes in Parliament, and remove
such Oppressions in Religion, Church, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Discipline, as they had brought in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he would remove from his
Council, all such as should promote the Peoples
Grievances, and Imploy in his great and publick
Affairs such as the Parliament should confide
in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he would not give away the
Lands Escheated to the Crown by the Rebellion
in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This last point, methinks, was not wisely
put in at this time; it should have been reserv'd
till they had subdued the Rebels, against whom
there were yet no Forces sent over: 'Tis like
selling the Lions Skin, before they had kill'd
him. But what answer was made to the other
two Propositions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What answer should be made but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial?</p>
               <p>About the same time the King himself Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
Articles against six persons of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
five whereof were of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and one of the House of Lords, accusing
them of High Treason: and upon the fourth of
<hi>January</hi> went himself to the House of Commons
to demand those five of them; but private no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
having been given by some Treacherous
person about the King, they had absented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and by that means frustrated His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Intention; and after he was gone, the
House making a hainous matter of it, and a
High Breach of their Priviledges, adjourned
themselves into <hi>London,</hi> there to sit as a General
Committee, pretending they were not safe at
<hi>Westminster;</hi> for the King, when he went to the
House to demand those persons, had somewhat
more attendance with him (but not otherwise
armed than his servants used to be) than he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
had, and would not be pacified (though
the King did afterwards wave the prosecution of
those persons) unless he would also discover to
them those that gave him Counsel to go in that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103390:62"/>
manner to the Parliament-House, to the
end they might receive condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            <sp>

               <p>This was a harsh Demand: Was it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

Rabble was so insolent, that scarce any of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
durst go to the House for fear of Violence
upon their Persons: insomuch that Twelve of
them excused themselves of Coming thither, and
by way of Perition to the King remonstrated
that they were not permitted to go quietly to
the Performance of that Duty, and protesting
against all Determinations as of none Effect, that
should pass in the House of Lords during their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103390:63"/>
forced Absence which the House of Commons
taking hold of, sent up to the Peers one of
their Members to accuse them of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
whereupon Ten of them were sent to the
Tower, after which time there was no more
words of their High Treason, but there passed
a Bill, by which they were deprived of their
Votes in Parliament: And to this Bill they got
the Kings Assent, and in the beginning of <hi>Sept.</hi>
after they Voted the Bishops should have no
more to do in the Government of the Church,

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What made the Parliament so averse to
Episcopacy, and especially the House of Lords,
whereof the Bishops were Members: For I see
no reason why they should do it to gratifie a
number of poor Parish Priests that were
Presbyterians, and that were never likely
to serve the Lords; but, on the contrary, to
do their best, to pull down their power,
and subject them to their Synods and
Classes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>For the Lords, very few of them did
perceive the intention of the Presbyterians;
and besides that, they durst not, I believe, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Lower House.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But why were the Lower-House so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
against them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Because they meant to make use of their
Tenants; and with pretended Sanctity, to make
the King and his Party odious to the People,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103390:63"/>
by whose help they were to set up <hi>Democrasie,</hi>
and Depose the King; or to let him have the
Title only so long as he should Act for their
purposes: But not only the Parliament, but in
a manner all the People of <hi>England,</hi> were their
Enemies upon the account of their behaviour,
as being (they said) too imperious. This was
all that was colourably laid to their charge;
the main of the pulling them down was the
Envy of the Presbyterians, that incensed the
People against them, and against Episcopacy it
self.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How would the Presbyterians have the

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Is not this to make the National Assembly
an Arch-Bishop, and the Provincial Assemblies
so many Bishops?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; but every Minister shall have the
delight of sharing the Government, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of being able to be reveng'd on
them that do not admire their Learning, and
help to fill their purses, and win to their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
them that do.</p>

               <p>'Tis a hard Case, that there should be
two Factions to trouble the Common-wealth
without any Interest of their own, other than
every particular man may have; and that their
quarrels should be only about Opinions, that is,
about who has the most Learning, as if their
Learning ought to be the Rule of Governing
the whole world. What is it they are Learned
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103390:64"/>
in? is it Politicks and Rules of State? I know
it is called Divinity; but I hear almost nothing
preacht but matter of Philosophy; for Religion
in it self admits of no Controversie: 'Tis a Law
of the Kingdom, and ought not to be disputed. I
do not think they pretend to speak with God,
and know his will by any other way than reading
the Scriptures, which we also do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, some of them do, and give themselves
out for Prophets, by extraordinary Inspiration;
but the rest pretend only (for their Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Benefices, and Charge of Souls) a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
skill in the Scriptures than other men have
by reason of their breeding in the Universities,
and knowledge there gotten of the Latin Tongue,
and some also of the Greek and Hebrew
Tongues, wherein the Scrlptures was written;
besides their knowledge of Natural Philosophy,
which is there publickly taught.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>As for the Latin, Greek and Hebrew, it
was once (to the Detection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fraud,
and to the Ejection of the Romish Power) very
profitable, or rather necessary. But now that is
done, and we have the Scripture in English, and
Preaching in English, I see no great need of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
Greek and Hebrew: I should think my self
better qualified by understanding well the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
of our Neighbours, French, Dutch, and
Italian. I think it was never seen in the world,
before the Power of Popes was set up, that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy

               <p>But Philosophy, together with Divinity,
hath very much conduced to the Advancement
of the Professors thereof, to places of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Authority, next to the Authority of Kings
themselves, in most of the Antient Kingdoms of
the world, as is manifestly to be seen in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story

               <p>First, what were the Druids of old time in

you may see in <hi>Caesar, Strabo,</hi> and others, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> the greatest Antiquary
perhaps that ever was, who speaking of the
Druids (which he calls Sarovides) in <hi>France,</hi> says
thus; There be also amongst them certain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
and Theologians that are exceedingly
honoured, whom they also use as Prophets. These
men by their skill in Augury, and Inspection into
the Bowels of Beasts sacrificed, foretell what is
to come, and have the multitude in obedience
to them, and a little after. It is a custom amongst
them, that no man may sacrifice without a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
because (say they) men ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their Thanks to the Gods, but by them that
know the Divine Nature, and are as it were of
the same Language with them; and that all good
things ought by such as these to be prayed for.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I can hardly believe that those Druids
were very skilful either in Natural Philosophy
or Moral.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nor I; for they held and taught the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103390:65"/>
Transmigration of souls from one body to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as did <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which Opinion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they took from him, or he from them,
I cannot tell. What were the <hi>Magi</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi>
but Philosophers and Astrologers? you know
how they came to find our Saviour by the
Conduct of a Star, either from <hi>Persia</hi> it self,
or from some Country more Eastward than
<hi>Judea:</hi> were not these in great Authority in
their Country? And are they not in most
part of Christendom, thought to have been
Kings? <hi>Aegypt</hi> hath been thought by many
the most Antient Kingdom and Nation of the
world, and their Priests had the greatest power
in Civil Affairs that any Subject ever had in
any Nation. And what were they but Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
and Divines? Concerning whom
the same <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> saies thus; The
whole Country of <hi>Egypt</hi> being divided into
three parts, the Body of the Priests have
One as being of most credit with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
both for their Devotion towards the
Gods, and also for their Understanding got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Education, and presently after: for
generally those men in the greatest Affairs
of all the King's Councillors, partly Executing,
and partly Informing and Advising; foretelling
him also (by their skill in Astrology and
Art in the Inspection of Sacrifices) the things
that are to come; and reading to him out of
their Holy Books such of the Actions there
recorded, as are profitable for him to know.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103390:65"/>
'Tis not there as in <hi>Greece,</hi> one man, or one
woman that has the Priesthood, but they are
many that attend the Honours and Sacrifices of
the Gods, and leave the same Imployment to
their posterity, which next to the King have the
greatest Power and Authority, concerning the
Judicature amongst the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> he saith
thus; from out of the most eminent Cities, <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolis,
Thebes</hi> and <hi>Memphis,</hi> they those Judges,
which are a Council not inferiour to that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reopagus</hi>
in <hi>Athens,</hi> or that of the Senate in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon;</hi>
when they are met, being in number
thirty, they chuse one from among themselves to
be Chief Justice; and the City whereof he is
sendeth another in his place: This Chief Justice
wore about his neck, hung in a gold Chain, a
Jewel of precious Stones; the name of which
Jewel was Truth, which when the Chief Justice
had put on, then began the Pleading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
when the Judges had agreed on the Sentence,
then did the Chief Justice put this Jewel of Truth
to one of the Pleas. You see now what power
was acquir'd in Civil matters by the Conjuncture
of Philosophy and Divinity: Let us come now to
the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews;</hi> was not the
Priesthood in a Family (namely the <hi>Levites</hi>) as
well as the Priesthood of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Did not the
High Priest give Judgment by the Breastplate of

of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and the Philosophers and <hi>Chaldaeans;</hi>

things to come by Purifications &amp; Sacrifices;

They have also skill in Augury, and in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Dreams and Wonders; nor are they
unskilful in the Art of Foretelling by the Inwards
of Beasts sacrificed, and have their Learning not
of the Greeks; for the Philosophy of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans</hi>
goes to their Family by Tradition, and the
Son receives it from his Father. From <hi>Assyria</hi>
let us pass into <hi>India,</hi> and see what esteem the
Philosophers had there. The whole Multitude
(says <hi>Diodoru)</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> is divided into
seven parts, whereof the first is the Body of the
Philosophers, for number the least, but for emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
the first; for they are free from Taxes; and
as they are not Masters of others, so are no others
Masters of them. By private Men they are called
to the Sacrifices, and to the care of Burials of the
Dead, as being thought most beloved of the
gods, and skilful in the Doctrine concerning Hell;
and for this Imployment receive Gifts and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

certain Custom is carried about to Feastings)
does accept of him, the Multitude Elect for
their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and presently adore and honour him,
as a God put into the Government by Divine
Providence. The King being chosen, he has the
manner of his Life limited to him by the Laws,
and does all other things according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the Country, neither rewarding nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
any man otherwise than from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is establisht amongst them by Law; nor use
they to put any man to death though he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to it, but to send some Officer to him
with a Token of Death, who seeing the Token,
goes presently to his own house, and kills himself
presently after. But the strangest thing of all is
that which they do concerning the Death of their
Kings for the Priests that live in <hi>Meroe,</hi> and
spend their time about the worship and honour
of the gods, and are in greatest Authority; when
they have a mind to it, send a Messenger to the
King, to bid him die, for that the gods have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
such order, and that the Commandments of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103390:67"/>
the Immortals are not by any means to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by those that are by nature Mortal, using
also other speeches to him, with men of simple
Judgment, that have not reason enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
against those unnecessary Commands, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
educated under an old and indelible Custom,
are content to admit of; therefore in former
times the Kings did obey the Priests, not as
mastered by force and Arms, but as having
their reason mastered by superstition. But in the
time of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the second, <hi>Ergamenes,</hi> King
of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> having had his Breeding in
Philosophy after the manner of the Greeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first that durst dispute their power, took
heart as befitted a King; came with souldiers to
a place called <hi>Abaton,</hi> where was then the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Temple of the <hi>Aethiopians;</hi> killed all the
Priests, abolished the Custom, and rectified the
Kingdom according to his will.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Though they that were kill'd were most
damnable Impostors, yet the Act was cruel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It was so; But were not the Priests cruel
to cause their Kings, whom a little before they
adored as Gods, to make away themselves? The
King kill'd them for the safety of his person,
they him, out of Ambition, or love of Change.
The King's Act may be coloured with the good
of his People; the Priests had no pretence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Kings, who were certainly very
godly, or else would never have obeyed the
Command of the Priests by a Messenger unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to kill themselves. Our late King, the best
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103390:67"/>
King perhaps that ever was (you know) was
murdered, having been first persecuted by War
at the Incitement of Presbyterian Ministers,
who are therefore guilty of the Death of all
that fell in that War, which were, I believe,
in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> near one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand persons. Had it not been much
better that those seditious Ministers which
were not perhaps a thousand, had been all
kill'd before that they had Preached? It had
been (I confess) a great Massacre; but the
killing of a hundred thousand is a greater.</p>

               <p>I am glad the Bishops were out at this
business; as ambitious as some say they are,
it did not appear in that business; for they

               <p>But I intend not by these Quotations
to commend either the Divinity, nor the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
of those Heathen People, but to
shew only what the Reputation of those Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
can effect among the People: For their
Divinity was nothing but Idolatry, and their
Philosophy (excepting the knowledge of the
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests, and from them the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans</hi>
had gotten by long Observation and
Study in Astronomy, Geometry, and Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,
very little, and that in great part abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Astrology and Fortune-telling; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Divinity of the Clergy in this Nation
now considered apart from the mixture that
has been introduced by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and in part retained here) of the babling Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103390:68"/>
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and other Greeks, that
has no Affinity with Religion, and serves
only to breed Disaffection, Dissention, and
finally Sedition and Civil War (as we have
lately found by dear Experience in the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between the Presbyterians and Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals)
is the true Religion. But for these
Differences, both Parties as they were in
Power, not only suppressed the Tenents of
one another, but also whatsoever Doctrine
lookt with an ill aspect upon their Interest;
and consequently all true Philosophy, especially
Civil and Moral, which can never appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
to Ambition, or to an Exemption
from Obedience due to the Soveraign
Power.</p>
               <p>After the King had accused the Lord
<hi>Kimbolton,</hi> a Member of the Lords House,
and <hi>Hollis, Hasl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rig, Hampden, Prinn,</hi> and
<hi>Stroud,</hi> Five Members of the Lower House,
of High Treason; and after the Parliament
had Voted out the Bishops from the House
of Peers, they pursued especially two things
in their Petitions to His Majesty, the one
was, that the King would declare who were the
persons that advised him to go as he did to
the Parliament-House to apprehend them;
and that he would leave them to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to receive condign punishment; and
this they did to stick upon His Majesty the
dishonour of Deserting his Friends, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
them to his Enemies: the other was,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103390:68"/>
that he would allow a Guard out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London</hi> to be commanded by the Earl
of <hi>Essex;</hi> for which they pretended they
could not else sit in safety, which pretence
was nothing but an upbraiding of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
for coming to Parliament, better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
than ordinary to seize the said five se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Members.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I see no reason in petitioning for a Guard,
they should determine it to the City of <hi>London</hi>
in particular, and the Command by name to the
Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> unless they meant the King should
understand it a Guard against himself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Their meaning was, that the King
should understand it so, and as (I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
they meant he should take it as an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front;
and the King himself understanding it so,
denied to grant it, though he were willing; if
they could not otherwise be satisfied, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
such a Guard to wait upon them, as he
would be responsible for to God Almighty.
Besides this, the City of <hi>London</hi> petition'd the
King (put upon it, no doubt, by some Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Lower House) to put the <hi>Tower</hi>
of <hi>London</hi> into the hands of persons of Trust,
meaning such as the Parliament should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of, And so appoint a Guard for the safety
of His Majesty and the Parliament. This method
of bringing petitions in a Tumultary Manner by
great Multitudes of Clamorous people, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
with the House of Commons, whose Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
could never have been served by way of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103390:69"/>
Prayer and Request, without extraordinary ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>After the King had waved the prosecution
of the Five Members, but denied to make
known, who had advised Him to come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to the House of Commons, they question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Attorney General, who, by the King's
Command, had Exhibited the Articles against
them, and voted Him, <hi>A Breaker of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Parliameut.</hi> And no doubt had made
him feel their Cruelty, if he had not speedily
fled the Land.</p>
               <p>About the end of <hi>January,</hi> they made an
Order of both Houses of Parliament, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the going over of Popish Commanders into
<hi>Ireland;</hi> not so much fearing that, as that by
this the King Himself choosing his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for that Service, might aid Himself out of
<hi>Ireland</hi> against the Parliament. But this was no
great matter, in respect of a Petition they
sent His Majesty about the same time, that is to
say, about the Twenty seventh, or Twenty
eighth of <hi>January,</hi> 1641. wherein they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in effect, the absolute Sovereignty of
<hi>England,</hi> though by the name of Sovereignty
they challeng'd it not, whil'st the King was
living; for to the End that the Fears and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of this Kingdom might be removed, and
the mischievous Designs of those who are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Peace of it, might be prevented,
they pray that His Majesty would be pleased
to put forthwith,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:103390:69"/>
First, The Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, All other Forts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The whole Militia of the Kingdom
into the hands of such persons as should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to him by both the Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>And this they stile a necessary Petition.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Were there really any such Fears and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
generally conceived here? or did there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
any Enemies at that time with such Designs
as are mentioned in the Petition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, but no other fear of Danger, but
such as discreet and honest Men might justly
have of the Designs of the Parliament it self,
who were the greatest Enemies to the Peace of
the Kingdom that could possibly be. 'Tis also
worth observing, that this Petition began with
these words, <hi>Most Gracious Sovereign;</hi> so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
they were, as not to know, that he that is
Master of the Militia, is Master of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and consequently is in possession of a most
absolute Sovereignty. The King was now at
<hi>Winsor,</hi> to avoid the Tumults of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People before the Gates at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Clamors and Affronts there the
Ninth of <hi>February;</hi> after he came to <hi>Hampton</hi>
Court, and thence went to <hi>Dover</hi> with the
Queen, and the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where the Queen, with the Princess of
<hi>Orange,</hi> embarked for <hi>Holland,</hi> but the King
returned to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> whence he sent for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103390:70"/>
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and so
went with them towards <hi>York.</hi>

               <p>It appears so by the Title, but I believe
they durst not but do it; the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
took them but for a Cypher, Men of
Title onely, without real power, but they
were very much mistaken; for the House of

Power which is intended to be established in

Commanders of the Militia in the several
Counties, and likewise to what time it shall be
limited; that no Power shall be Executed by
His Majesty alone, without the advice of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
then he will declare that (for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
them from all Dangers or Jealousies of
any) then His Majesty will be content to put
into all the places, both Forts and Militia in the
several Counties, such persons as both the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

That in this Case of extream Danger, and of His

Court of Judicature in the Kingdom, shall declare
what the Law of the Land is, to have this not

is; so that they have taken from the King not
only the Militia, but also the Legislative
Power.</p>

               <p>They have so. But I make account the
Legislative Power (and indeed all Power pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
is contain'd in the Power of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</p>
               <p>After this they seize such Mony as was due
to His Majesty upon the Bill of Tunnage and
Poundage, and upon the Bill of Subsidies, that
they might disable him every way they possibly
could. They sent Him also many other contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious
Messages and Petitions after His coming
to <hi>York,</hi> amongst which one was, <hi>That whereas
the Lord Admiral, by indisposition of Body, could
not command the Fleet in Person, He would be
pleased to give Authority to the Earl of</hi> Warwick
<hi>to supply his place;</hi> when they knew the King
had put Sir <hi>John Pennington</hi> in it before.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>To what End did the King entertain so
many Petitions; Messages, Declarations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances,
and vouchsafe His Answers to them,
when He could not choose but clearly see they
were resolv'd to take from Him His Royal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and consequently His Life? For it could not
stand with their safety, to let either Him or His
Issue live, after they had done Him so great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</p>

               <p>Besides this, the Parliament had at the
same time a Committee residing at <hi>York,</hi> to spie
what His Majesty did, and to inform the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
thereof; and also to hinder the King
from gaining the People of that County to His
Party: so that when His Majesty was Courting

               <p>I know not; but I believe, he knew the
Parliament had a greater Party than he, not only
in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> but also in <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Towards the End of <hi>April</hi> the King, upon
Petition of the People of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> to have the
Magazine of <hi>Hull</hi> to remain still there, for the
greater security of the Northern Parts, thought
fit to take it into his own hands. He had a little
before appointed Governor of the Town the
Earl of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> but the Townsmen having
been already corrupted by the Parliament, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to receive him, but refus'd not to receive
Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> appointed to be Governor by
the Parliament. The King therefore coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Town, Guarded only by a few of his
own Servants, and a few Gentlemen of the
Country thereabouts, was deny'd Entrance by
Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> that stood upon the Wall; for
which Act, he presently caused Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi>
to be proclaim'd Traytor, and sent a Message to
the Parliament, requiring Justice to be done upon
the said <hi>Hotham,</hi> and that the Town and Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
might be delivered into his hands.</p>
               <p>To which the Parliament made no Answer, but
instead thereof published another Declaration,
in which they omitted nothing of their former
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103390:73"/>
Slanders against His Majesties Government, but
inserted certain Propositions declarative of their
own pretended Right, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> That whatsoever they declare to be Law,
ought not to be question'd by the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II.</hi> That no Precedent can be Limits, to bound
their Proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III.</hi> That a Parliament, for the Publick Good,
may dispose of any thing wherein the King or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
hath a Right; and that they, without the
King, are this Parliament, and the Judge of this
Publick Good, and that the King's consent is not
necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> That no Member of either House ought to
be troubled for Treason, Felony, or any other Crime,
unless the Cause be first brought before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they may judge of the Fact, and give
leave to proceed, if they see Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> That the Sovereign Power resides in both

Voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI.</hi> That the Levying of Forces against the
Personal Commands of the King, (though accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

his Trust, or not.</p>

               <p>In the Parliament Roll of <hi>Henry IV.</hi> amongst
the Articles of the Oath the King at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>Concedes Justas Leges &amp; Consuetudines esse te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendas,
&amp; promitos per te eas esse protegendas, &amp;
ad honorem Dei corroborandas quas Vulgus elege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Which the Parliament urged for their Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Authority, and therefore interpret <hi>quas

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gerit,</hi> which the People shall choose;
as if the King should swear to protect and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate
Laws before they were made, whether
they be Good or Bad: whereas the words sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
no more, but that he shall protect and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate
such Laws, as they have chosen; that
is to say, the Acts of Parliament then in being.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:103390:74"/>
                  <hi>And in the Records of the Exchequer it is
thus,</hi> Will you grant to hold and keep the Laws,
and rightful Customs, which the Commonalty of this
your Kingdom have? And will you defend and
uphold them, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was the Answer His Majesty made to
that Point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think his Answer very full and clear; but
if the words were to be interpreted in the other
sense, yet I see no reason why the King should
be bound to swear to them; for <hi>Henry IV.</hi> came
to the Crown by the Votes of a Parliament, not
much inferior in wickedness to this Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that Deposed and Murdered their Lawful
King, saving that it was not the Parliament it
self, but the Usurper that murdered King
<hi>Richard II.</hi>

               <p>About a week after, in the beginning of
<hi>May,</hi> the Parliament sent the King another Paper,
which they stil'd, <hi>The Humble Petition and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of both Houses:</hi> Containing Nineteen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
which when you shall hear, you shall
be able to judge what Power they meant to
leave to the King, more than to any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
The first of them is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> That the Lords, and other of His Majesties
Privy Council, and all great Officers of State, both
at home and abroad, be put from their Imployments,
and from his Council, save only such as should be
approved of by both Houses of Parliament; and
none put into their places, but by approbation of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103390:75"/>
said Houses. And that all Privy Councillors take an
Oath for the due Execution of their places, in such
form as shall be agreed upon by the said Houses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II.</hi> That the great Affairs of the Kingdom be
Debated, Resolv'd and Transacted only in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and such as shall presume to do any thing to
the contrary, to be reserv'd to the Censure o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the
Parliament; and such other Matters of State as
are proper for His Majesties Privy Couneil, shall be
Debated and Concluded by such as shall from time
to time be chosen for that place by both Houses of
Parliament. And that no Publick Act concerning
the Affairs of the Kingdom which are proper for
his Privy Council, be esteemed valid, as proceeding
from the Royal Authority, unless it be done by the
Advice and Consent of the Major part of the
Council, attested under their Hands; and that the
Council be not more than 25, nor less than 15; and
that when a Councillors place falls, it shall not be
supplied, without the Assent of the Major part of
the Council; and that such Choice also shall be
void, if the next Parliament after confirm it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III.</hi> That the Lord High Steward of <hi>England,</hi>
Lord High Constable, Lord Chancellor, or Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal, Lord Treasurer, Lord
Privy Seal, Earl Marshal, Lord Admiral, Warden
of the Cinque Ports, Chief Governor of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Master of the Wards,
Secretaries of State, Two Chief Justices and Chief
Baron, be always chosen with the Approbation of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103390:75"/>
both Houses of Parliament; and in the Intervals
of Parliament, by the Major part of the Privy
Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> That the Government of the King's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall be committed to such as both Houses shall
approve of; and in the Intervals of Parliament,
such as the Privy Council shall approve of, that the
Servants then about them, against whom the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
have just exception, should be remov'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> That no Marriage be concluded, or treated
of, for any of the King's Children, without consent of
Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI.</hi> That the Laws in force against Jesuits,
Priests, and Popish Recusants, be strictly put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VII.</hi> That the Votes of Popish Lords in the
House of Peers be taken away; and that a Bill be
passed for the Education of the Children of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in the Protestant Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> That the King will be pleas'd to reform
the Church-Government and Liturgy, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as both Houses of Parliament shall advise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IX.</hi> That he would be pleased to rest satisfied
with that course the Lords and Commons have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for ordering the Militia, and recall his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
and Proclamations against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:103390:76"/>
                  <hi>X.</hi> That such Members as have been put out of
any Place or Office since this Parliament began, may
be restor'd, or have satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XI.</hi> That all Privy Councillors and Judges take an
Oath, the form whereof shall be agreed on, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Act of Parliament, for the maintaining the
Petition of Right, and of certain Statutes made by
the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XII.</hi> That all the Judges and Officers placed by
Approbation of both Houses of Parliament, may
held their places <hi>quamdiu bene se gesserint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XIII.</hi> That the Justice of Parliament may pass
upon all Delinquents, whether they be within the
Kingdom, or fled out of it; and that all persons ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by either House of Parliament, may appear and
abide the Censure of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XIV.</hi> That the General Pardon offered by his
Majesty, be granted with such Exceptions as shall
be advised by both Houses of Parliament.</p>

               <p>What a spightful Article was this? All the

                  <hi>XIX.</hi> That His Majesty be pleased to pass a Bill
for restraining Peers, made hereafter from sitting

with consent of both Houses of Parliament. These
Propositions granted, they promise to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to regulate His Majesties Revenue to his best
advantage, and to settle it to the support of his
Royal Dignity, in Honour and Plenty; and also to
put the Town of <hi>Hull</hi> into such hands as His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty

               <p>Is not that to put it into such hands as His
Majesty shall appoint by the consent of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners,
which is no more than to keep it in
their hands, as it is? Did they want, or think
the King wanted common sense, so as not to

nothing?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>After the sending of these Propositions to
the King, and His Majesties refusal to grant them,
they began on both sides to prepare for War, the
King raising a Guard for his Person in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi>
and the Parliament thereupon having Voted,
<hi>That the King intended to make War upon his
Parliament,</hi> gave Order for the Mustering and
Exercising the People in Arms, and published
Propositions to invite and encourage them to
bring in either ready Money or Plate, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
under their hands to maintain certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Horse, Horsemen and Arms, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the King and Parliament, (meaning by
King, as they had formerly declar'd, not his
Person, but his Laws) promising to repay their
Money with Interest of 8 <hi>l.</hi> in the hundred, and
the value of their Plate with 12 <hi>d.</hi> the ounce for
the fashion. On the other side the King came to
<hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there did set up his Standard
Royal, and sent out Commissioners of Array to
call those to him, which by the ancient Laws of
<hi>England</hi> were bound to serve him in the Wars.
Upon this occasion there passed divers Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
between the King and Parliament, concerning
the Legality of this Array, which are too long
to tell you at this time.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Nor do I desire to hear any Mooting
about this Question, for I think that general Law
of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> and the Right of defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against those that had taken from him the
Sovereign Power, are sufficient to make Legal
whatsoever he should do, in order to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his Kingdom, or the punishing of the
Rebels.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In the mean time the Parliament raised an
Army, and made the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> General
thereof; by which Act they declar'd what they
meant formerly, when they Petition'd the King
for a Guard, to be commanded by the said Earl
of <hi>Essex.</hi> And now the King sends out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
forbidding Obedience to the Orders
of the Parliament concerning the Militia; and
the Parliament send out Orders against the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of the Commissions of Array; hitherto
(though it were a War before) yet there was
no Blood shed, they shot at one another nothing
but Paper.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I understand now how the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
the Peace of the Kingdom, and how easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the help of seditious <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and of ambitious ignorant Orators, they
reduced the Government into Anarchy: but I
believe it will be a harder task for them to bring
in Peace again, and settle the Government either
in themselves, or in any other Governor, or form
of Government; for granting that they obtain'd
the Victory in this War, they must be beholding
for it to the Valor, good Conduct, or Felicity of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103390:78"/>
those to whom they give the Command of their
Armies, especially to the General, whose good
success will, without doubt, bring with it the
love and admiration of the Soldiers; so that it
will be in his power either to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon himself, or to place it where himself
thinks good. In which Case, if he take it not to
himself, he will be thought a Fool; and if he do,
he shall be sure to have the Envy of his subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Commanders, who will look for a share
either in the present Government, or in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to it; for they will say, has he obtain'd
this Power by his own without our Danger,
Valor and Council? And must we be his Slaves,

               <p>They will and did insomuch that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after he had gotten into his
own hands the absolute Power of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Name of Protector, did
never dare to take upon him the Title of King,
nor was ever able to settle it upon his Children,
his Officers would not suffer it, as pretending
after his death to succeed him; nor would the
Army consent to it, because he had ever decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to them against the Government of a Single
Person.</p>

               <p>But to return to the King, What Means
had he to pay? What Provision had he to Arm,
nay Means to Levy an Army, able to resist the
Army of the Parliament, maintained by the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103390:78"/>
great Purse of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
of almost all the Towns Corporate in
<hi>England,</hi> and furnished with Arms as fully as
they could require?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, the King had great disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and yet by little and little he got a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Army, with which he so prospered, as to
grow stronger every day, and the Parliament
weaker, till they had gotten the <hi>Scotch</hi> with an
Army of 21000 Men to come into <hi>England</hi> to
their assistance; but to enter into the particular
Narrative of what was done in the War, I have

               <p>WE left at the Preparations on both
sides for War, which when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by my self, I was mightily puzled to find
out what possibility there was for the King to
equal the Parliament in such a course, and what
hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He had of Money, Men, Arms, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Places, Shipping, Council, and Military Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
sufficient for such an Enterprize against
the Parliament, that had Men and Money as
much at Command, as the City of <hi>London,</hi> and
other Corporation Towns were able to furnish,
which was more than they needed. And for the
Men they should set forth for Soldiers, they
were almost all of them spightfully bent against
the King, and his whole Party, whom they took
to be either Papists, or Flatterers of the King, or
that had design'd to raise their Fortunes by the
Plunder of the City, and other Corporation
Towns; and though I believe not that they
were more valiant than other Men, nor that
they had so much experience in the War, as to be
accounted good Soldiers; yet they had that in
them, which in time of Battel is more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to Victory than Valor, and Experience both
together, and that was Spight.</p>
               <p>And for Arms, they had in their hands the
chief Magazines, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103390:79"/>
                  <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> besides most of Powder
and Shot that lay in several Towns, for the use of
the Trained Bonds.</p>
               <p>Fortified places there were not many then in
<hi>England,</hi> and most of them in the hands of the
Parliament.</p>
               <p>The King's Fleet was wholly in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
under the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> Councillors
they needed no more, than such as were of their
own Body, so that the King was every way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to them, except it were perhaps in Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot compare their chief Officers for
the Parliament, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (after the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had Voted the War) was made General
of all their Forces, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
from whom, all other Commanders were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Commissions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What moved them to make the Earl of
<hi>Essex</hi> General? And for what cause was the Earl
of <hi>Essex</hi> so displeased with the King, as to accept
that Office?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I do not certainly know what to answer to
either of those Questions, but the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
had been in the Wars abroad, and wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Experience, Judgment nor Courage to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
such an undertaking; and besides that, you
have heard, (I believe) how great a Darling
of the people, his Father had been before him;
and what Honour he had gotten by the success of
his Enterprize upon <hi>Cales,</hi> and in some other
Military actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:103390:80"/>
To which I may add, That this Earl himself
was not held by the People to be so great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
at Court, as that they might not trust
him with their Army against the King, and by
this you may perhaps conjecture the cause for
which the Parliament made choice of him for
General.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But why did they think him discontented
with the Court?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I know not that, nor indeed that he was
so; he came to Court as other Noblemen did,
when occasion was to wait upon the King, but
had no Office till a little before this time, to
oblige him to be there continually; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
verily, that the unfortunateness of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
had so discountenanced his Conversation
with Ladies, that the Court could be his proper
Element, unless he had had some extraordinary
savour there, to balance that calamity for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
discontent from the King, or intention of
revenge for any supposed disgrace, I think he
had none; nor that he was any wayes addicted
to <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Doctrines, or other Fanatick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
in Church or State, saving only that he was
carried away with the stream, (in a manner)
of the whole Nation, to think that <hi>England</hi> was
not an absolute, but a mixt Monarchy, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the Supreme Power must alwayes
be absolute, whether it be in the King, or in the
Parliament.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>None yet but Himself, nor indeed had He
yet any Army but there, coming to him at that
time two Nephews, the Princes <hi>Rupert</hi> and
<hi>Maurice;</hi> He put the Command of His Horse
into the hands of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> a Man then
whom no man living has a better courage, nor
was more active and diligent in prosecuting his
Commission; and though but a young Man then,
was not without experience in the conducting of
Soldiers, as having been an Actor in part of his
Fathers Wars in <hi>Germany.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But how would the King find money to
pay such an Army as was necessary for Him,
against the Parliament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Neither the King nor Parliament had
much money at that time in their own hands,
but were fain to relie upon the Benevolence of
those that took their parts, wherein (I confess)
the Parliament had a mighty great advantage;
those that helped the King in that kind, were
only Lords and Gentlemen, which not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the proceedings of the Parliament, were
willing to undertake the payment every one of
a certain number of Horse, which cannot be
thought any very great assistance, the persons
that payed them being so few; for other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that the King then had, I have not heard of
any but what he borrow'd upon Jewels in the
<hi>Low-Countries;</hi> whereas the Parliament had a
very plentiful Contribution, not only from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
but generally from their Faction in all
other places of <hi>England,</hi> upon certain Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103390:81"/>
(published by the Lords and Commons in
<hi>June 1642.)</hi> at which time they had newly
Voted, That the King intended to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, for bringing in of Money or Plate, to
maintain Horse and Horsemen, and to buy Arms
for the preservation of the Publick Peace, and
for the defence of the King, and both Houses of
Parliament; for the Re-payment of which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Plate, they were to have the <hi>Publick
Faith.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What <hi>Publick Faith</hi> is there, when there
is no <hi>Publick?</hi> What is it that can be call'd <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
in a Civil War, without the King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Truth is, the Security was nothing
worth, but serv'd well enough to gull those sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Blockheads that were more fond of change,
than either of their peace or profit, having by
this means gotten Contributions from those that
were the well-affected to their Cause, they made
use of it afterwards, to force the like Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from others; for in <hi>November</hi> following,
they made an Ordinance for Assessing also of
those that had not Contributed then, or had
Contributed, but not proportionably to their
Estates. And yet this was contrary to what the
Parli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment promised and declar'd in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
themselves; for they declar'd in the first
Proposition, <hi>That no mans Affection should be
measured by the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>portion of his Offer, so that he
expressed his good will to the Service in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatsoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:103390:81"/>
Besides this, in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
they made an Ordinance to Levy week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a great Sum of money upon every County,
City, Town, Place and Person of any Estate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in <hi>England;</hi> which weekly Sum (as may
appear by the Ordinance it self, printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in <hi>March</hi> 1642, by Order of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
comes to almost 33000 <hi>l.</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to above 1700000 <hi>l.</hi> for the year. They had,
besides all this, the Profits of the King's Lands
and Woods, and whatsoever was remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid
of any Subsidy formerly granted Him, and
the Tunnage and Poundage usually received by
the King, besides the profit of the Sequestration
of great persons, whom they pleas'd to vote
Delinquents, and the profits of the Bishops
Lands, which they took to themselves a year,
or a little more after.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing then the Parliament had such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the King in Money, Arms, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Men, and had in their hands the King's
Fleet, I cannot imagine what hope the King
could have either of Victory (unless He resign'd
into their hands the Sovereignty, or subsisting:)
for I cannot well believe He had any advantage
of them either in Councillors, Conducts, or in
the Resolution of his Soldiers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>On the contrary, I think He had also some
disadvantage in that; for though He had as good
Officers at least as any then serv'd the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet I doubt He had not so useful Council
as was necessary. And for His Soldiers, though
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103390:82"/>
they were Men as stout as theirs, yet because
their Valor was not sharpned so with Malice, as
theirs was of the other side, they sought not so
keenly as their Enemies did, amongst whom
there was a great many <hi>London</hi> Apprentices,
who, for want of experience in the War, would
have been fearful enough of death and wounds
approaching visibly in glittering Swords, but for
want of judgment scarce thought of such a death
as comes invisibly in a Bullet, and therefore
were very hardly to be driven out of the Field.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But what fault do you find in the King's
Councils, Lords, and other Persons of Quality
and Experience?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Only that fault which was generally in
the whole Nation, which was, That they thought
the Government of <hi>England</hi> was not an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
but a mixt Monarchy; and that if the King
should clearly subdue this Parliament, that His
power would be what He pleased, and theirs as
little as He pleased, which they counted Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
This opinion, though it did not les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en their
endeavors to gain the Victory for the King in a
Battel, when the Battel could not be avoided,
yet it weakned their endeavors to procure him
an absolute Victory in the War. And for this
cause, notwithstanding that they saw that the
Parliament was firmly resolv'd to take all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power whatsoever out of His Hands, yet their
Council to the King was upon all occasions to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Propositions to them of Treaty and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
and to make and publish Declarations
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103390:82"/>
which any Man might easily have foreseen
would be fruitless; and not only so, but also of
great disadvantage to those Actions by which the
King was to recover His Crown, and preserve
His Life; for it took off the courage of the best
and forwardest of his Soldiers that lookt for
great benefit out of the Estates of the Rebels, in
case they could subdue them, but none at all if
the business should be ended by a Treaty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And they had reason, for a Civil War never
ends by Treaty, without the Sacrifice of those,
who were on both sides the sharpest. You know
well enough how things past the Reconciliation
of <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> in <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But I thought
that after they once began to Levy Soldiers one
against another, that they would not any more
have return'd of either side to Declarations, or
other Paper War, which if it could have done
any good, would have done it long before this.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But seeing the Parliament continued wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and set forth their Declarations to the
People against the Lawfulness of the King's
Commission of Array, and sent Petitions to the
King as fierce and rebellions as ever they had
done before, demanding of him, That he would

                  </gap>band his Soldiers, and come up to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and leave those whom the Parliament cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Delinquents, (which were none but the
King's best Subjects) to their Mercy, and pass
such Bills as they should advise Him. Would you
not have the King set forth Declarations and
Proclamations, against the Illegality of their
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103390:83"/>
Ordinances, by which they Levied Soldiers
against him, and answer those insolent Petitions
of theirs?</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No, it had done him no good before, and
therefore was not likely to do him any after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
for the Common People, whose hands
were to decide the Controversie, understood not
the Reasons of either Party; and for those that
by Ambition were once set upon the Enterprize
of changing the Government, they cared not
much what was Reason and Justice, in the Cause,
but what Strength they might procure, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the multitude with Remonstrances from
the Parliament-House, or by Sermons in the
Churches; and to their Petitions, I would not
have had any answer at all more than this, That
if they would disband their Army, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon his Mercy, they should find Him
more Gracious than they expected.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That had been a gallant answer indeed, if

assurance of a Victory at last in the whole

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103390:83"/>
would have brought to His assistance many
more hands, than all the arguments of Law, or

               <p>You may know by the Declarations
themselves, which are very long, and full of

Reported, that the Penners of them were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lawyers by Profession, or such Gentlemen
as had the ambition to be thought so. Besides, I
told you before, that those which were then
likeliest to have their counsel asked in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
were averse to absolute Monarchy, as also
to absolute Democracy, or Aristocracy; all which
Governments they esteemed Tyranny, and were
in love with Monarchy, which they us'd to
praise by the name of mixt Monarchy, though it
were indeed nothing else but pure Anarchy: and
those Men whose Pens the King most us'd in
these Controversies of Law, and Politick, were
such (if I have not been misinformed) as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been Members of this Parliament, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
against Ship-money, and other Extra-Parliamentary
Taxes, as much as any: but when

done, went over to the King's Party.</p>

               <p>You have forgotten that I told you that
the King Himself, by a Bill that He passed at the
same time when He passed the Bill for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
for the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> had given them
Authority to hold the Parliament, till they
should by consent of both Houses dissolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
If therefore He had by any Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Message to the Houses dissolv'd them,
they would, to their former De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amations of His
Majesties actions, have added this, That He was
a Breaker of His Word, and not only in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Him, have continued their Session, but
also have made advantage of it, to the increase
and strengthning of their own Party.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Would not the King's raising of an Army
against them, be interpreted as a purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
them by force? And was it not as great a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103390:84"/>
breach of promise to scatter them by force, as
to dissolve them by Proclamation? Besides, I
cannot conceive that the passing of that Act was
otherwise intended than conditionally, so long as
they should not ordain any thing contrary to the
Sovereign Right of the King, which condition
they had already by many of their Ordinances
broken; and, I think, that even by the Law of
Equity, which is the unalterable Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a man that has the Sovereign Power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
if he would, give away the right of any
thing which is necessary for him to retain, for the
good Government of his Subjects, unless he do
it in express words, saying, That he will have the
Sovereign Power no longer; for the giving away
that which by consequence only draws the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
along with it, is not (I think) a giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of the Sovereignty, but an error, such
as work nothing but an invalidity in the Grant it
self. And such was the King's passing this Bill, for
the continuing of the Parliament, as long as the
Two Houses pleas'd. But now that the War was
resolv'd on, on both sides, what needed any
more dispute in writings?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I know not what need they had, but on
both sides they thought it needful to hinder one
another as much as they could from levying of
Soldiers, and therefore the King did set forth
Declarations in Print; to make the people know
that they ought not to obey the Officers of the
new Militia set up by Ordinance of Parliament,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103390:85"/>
and also to let them see the Legality of His own
Commissions of Array; and the Parliament on
their part did the like, to justifie to the people
the said Ordinance, and to make the Commission
of Array appear unlawful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When the Parliament were Levying of
Soldiers, was it not lawful for the King to Levy
Soldiers, to defend Himself and His Right,
though there had been no other Title for it, but
His own preservation, and that the name of
Commission of Array had never been heard
of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, I think there cannot be a
better Title for War, than the defence of a Man's
own Right, but the People at that time thought
nothing lawful for the King to do, for which
there was not some Statute made by Parliament.
For the Lawyers, I mean the Judges of the
Courts of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and some few others,
though but Advocates, yet of great Reputation
for their skill in the Common Laws, and Statutes
of <hi>England,</hi> had infected most of the Gentry of
<hi>England</hi> with their Maxims and Cases prejudg'd,
which they call Precedents, and made them
think so well of their own knowledge in the
Law, that they were of this occasion to shew it
against the King, and thereby to gain a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Parliament, of being good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
and wise Statesmen.</p>

               <p>King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror had gotten
into his hands by Victory, all the Lands in
<hi>England,</hi> of which he disposed some part, as
Forests and Chaces for his own Recreation, and
some part to Lords and Gentlemen, that had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
him, or were to assist him in the Wars; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he laid a charge of service in his Wars,
some with more Men, and some with less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Lands he had given them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
when the King sent Men unto them with
Commission to make use of their Service, they
were obliged to appear with Arms, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the King to the Wars, for a certain
time at their own Charges, and such were the
Commissions by which this King did then make
his Levies.</p>

               <p>No doubt but it was Legal, but what did
that amount to with Men that were already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd

was against their design of abolishing Monarchy,

               <p>I intended only the Story of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,

               <p>I shall only make use of such a Thread as is
necessary for the filling up of such Knavery and
Folly also, as I shall observe in their several
Actions.</p>
               <p>From <hi>York</hi> the King went to <hi>Hull,</hi> where was
His Magazine of Arms for the Northern Parts
of <hi>England,</hi> to try if they would admit Him; the
Parliament had made Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> Governor
of the Town, who caused the Gates to be shut,
and presenting himself upon the walls, flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
Him entrance; for which the King caused
him to be proclaim'd Traytor, and sent a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the Parliament, to know if they own'd
the Actions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Upon what grounds?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Their pretence was this, That neither this,
nor any other Town in <hi>England</hi> was otherwise
the Kings, than in Trust for the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But what was that to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, say they, for we are the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the People of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot see the force of this Argument:
We represent the People; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that the
People has is ours: The Mayor of <hi>Hull</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the King, Is therefore all the King had
in <hi>Hull</hi> the Mayor's? The People of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:103390:86"/>
may be represented with Limitations, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
a Petition, or the like, does it follow, that
they who deliver the Petition, have Right to all
the Towns in <hi>England?</hi> When began this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be a Representative of <hi>England?</hi> Was
it not <hi>November</hi> 3. 1640? Who was it the day
before that had the Right to keep the King out
of <hi>Hull,</hi> and possess it for themselves? For
there was then no Parliament, whose was <hi>Hull</hi>
then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think it was the King's; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was called the King's Town upon <hi>Hull,</hi>
but because the King Himself did then and ever
represent the Person of the People of <hi>England.</hi>
If He did not, who then did, the Parliament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Being?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>They might perhaps say, the People had
then no Representative.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then there was no Commonwealth, and
consequently all the Towns of <hi>England</hi> being
the Peoples, you and I, and any Man else, might
have put in for his share. You may see by this,
what weak People they were, that were carried
into the Rebellion, by such weak reasoning as
this Parliament used; and how impudent they
were, that did put such Fallacies upon
them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Surely they were such, as were esteem'd
the wisest Men in <hi>England,</hi> being upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
chosen to be the Parliament.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell that; for I know it is usual
with the Freeholders in the Counties, and the
Tradesmen in the Cities and Burroughs to
choose, as near as they can, such as are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the giving of Subsidies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The King in the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
He had summon'd <hi>Hull,</hi> and tryed some of the
Counties thereabout, what they would do for
Him, set up His Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> but
there came not in thither Men enough to make
any Army sufficient to give Battel to the Earl of
<hi>Essex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence He went to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where
He was quickly furnished; and appointing the
Earl of <hi>Lins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y</hi> to be General, He resolv'd to
march towards <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was at <hi>Worcester</hi> with the
Parliament Army, making no offer to stop Him
in His passage, but as soon as He was gone by,
marched close after Him.</p>
               <p>The King therefore, to avoid being inclosed
between the Army of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the
City of <hi>London,</hi> turned upon him, and gave him
Battel at <hi>Edge-hill;</hi> where, though He got not
an intire Victory, yet He had the better, if either
had the better; and had certainly the fruit of a
Victory, which was to march on, in his intended
way towards <hi>London,</hi> in which the next morning
He took <hi>Banbury</hi> Castle, and from thence went to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103390:87"/>
                  <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thence to <hi>Brentford,</hi> where he gave
a great Defeat to Three Regiments of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Forces, and so return'd to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why did not the King go on from <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Parliament, upon the first notice of
the King's marching from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> caused all
the Trained Bands, and the Auxiliaries of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London</hi> (which were so frighted, as to
shut up all their shops) to be drawn forth; so
that there was a complete and numerous Army
ready for the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> that was crept into
<hi>London</hi> just at that time to head it, and this was
it that made the King retire to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> after Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
took <hi>Cirencester</hi> from the Parliament, with
many Prisoners, and many Arms, for it was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made a Magazine. And thus stood the business
between the King's, and the Parliaments For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>The Parliament in the mean time, caused a
Line of Communication to be made about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and the Suburbs, of 12 miles in compass, and
constituted a Committee for the Assotiation, and
the putting into a posture of defence the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Essex, Cambridge, Suffolk,</hi> and some
others; and one of those Commissioners was
<hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> from which employment he

               <p>What was done, during this time, in other
Parts of the Countrey?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In the West, the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> had the
employment of putting in execution the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Parliament for the Militia; and Sir
<hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> for the King, executed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Array. Between those two was
fought a Battel at <hi>Liscard</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where Sir
<hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> had the Victory, and presently took
a Town called <hi>Saltash,</hi> with many Arms, and
much Ordnance, and many Prisoners. Sir <hi>William
Waller</hi> in the mean time seized <hi>Winchester</hi> and
<hi>Chichester</hi> for the Parliament.</p>
               <p>In the North, for the Commission of Array,
my Lord of <hi>Newcastle;</hi> and for the Militia of
the Parliament, was my Lord <hi>Fairfax.</hi> My Lord
of <hi>Newcastle</hi> took from the Parliament <hi>Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
in which were a great part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Forces for that County, and had made
himself, in a manner, Master of all the North,
about this time, that is to say, in <hi>February;</hi> the
Queen landed at <hi>Barlington,</hi> and was conducted by
my Lord of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tross,</hi>
to <hi>York;</hi> and not long after, to the King.</p>
               <p>Divers other little advantages, besides these,
had the King's Party of the Parliaments in the
North.</p>
               <p>There hapned also between the Militia of the
Parliament, the Commission of Array in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire,</hi>
under my Lord <hi>Brook</hi> for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> for the King,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103390:88"/>
great contention, wherein both these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
were slain; for my Lord <hi>Brook</hi> besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Lichfield-Close,</hi> was kill'd with a shot, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which they gave not over the
Siege, till they were Masters of the <hi>Close.</hi> But
presently after my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
it again for the King, which to relieve,
Sir <hi>William Brereston,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> advanced
towards <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and were met at <hi>Hopton-heath</hi>
by the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and routed, the Earl
himself was slain, but his Forces with Victory
return'd to the Siege again; and shortly after
seconded by Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who was then abroad
in that Countrey, carried the place.</p>
               <p>These were the chief Actions of this year
164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But the Parliament had now a better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
insomuch that if the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
followed the King to <hi>Oxford</hi> (not
yet well fortified) he might, in all likelihood,
have taken it; for he could not want either Men
or Ammunition, whereof the City of <hi>London</hi>
(which was wholly at the Parliaments devotion)
had store enough.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot judge of that; but this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
considering the estate the King was in at his
first marching from <hi>York,</hi> when He had neither
Money, nor Men, nor Arms enough, to put Him
in hope of Victory, that this year (take it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
was very prosperous.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But what great Folly or Wickedness do
you observe in the Parliaments Actions for this
first year?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>All that can be said against them in that
point, will be excus'd with the pretext of War,
and come under one Name of Rebellion, saving
that when they summoned any Town, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the Name of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The King being in the contrary Army, and
many times beating them from the Siege, I do
not see how the right of War can justifie such
Impudence as that. But they pretended that the
King was alwayes vertually in the Two Houses
of Parliament making a distinction between His
Person Natural and Politique, which made the
Impudence the greater, besides the folly of it:
For this was but an University Quibble, such as
Boyes make use of, in maintaining (in the
Schools) such Tenets as they cannot otherwise
defend.</p>
               <p>In the end of this year, they sollicited also
the <hi>Scots</hi> to enter <hi>England,</hi> with an Army to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the power of the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> in the
North, which was a plain Confession, that the
Parliament Forces were at this time inferior to
the Kings; and most Men thought, that if the
Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> had then marched South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and joined his Forces with the Kings, that
most of the Members of Parliament would have
fled out of <hi>England.</hi>

In the beginning of 1643. the Parliament see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi>'s power in the North
grown formidable, sent to the <hi>Scots,</hi> to hire
them to an Invasion of <hi>England;</hi> and (to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
them in the mean time) made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
among themselves, such as the <hi>Scots</hi> before
had made against Episcopacy, and demolished
Crosses, and Church-windows, (such as had in
them any Images of Saints) throughout all
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also in the middle of the year, they made a
Solemn League with the Nation, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Solemn League and Covenant.</hi>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Are not the <hi>Scots</hi> as properly to be called
Foreigners, as the <hi>Irish?</hi> seeing then they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> even to death, for
advising the King to make use of <hi>Irish</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against the Parliament; with what face
could they call in a <hi>Scotch</hi> Army against the
King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The King's Party might easily here have
discern'd their design, to make themselves abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Masters of the Kingdom, and to dethrone
the King.</p>
               <p>Another great Impudence, or rather a Bestial
Incivility it was of theirs, That they Voted the
Queen a Traytor, for helping the King with
some Ammunition, and <hi>English</hi> Forces, from
<hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was it possible that all this could be done,
and Men not see that Papers and Declarations
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103390:90"/>
must be useless? And that nothing could satisfie
them, but the Deposing of the King, and setting
up of themselves in His place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, very possible, for who was there of
them, though knowing that the King had the
Sovereign Power, that knew the Essential Rights
of Sovereignty? They dreamt of a mixt Power
of the King and the Two Houses, That it was a
divided Power, in which there could be no
Peace, was above their understanding, therefore
they were alwayes urging the King to Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Treaties, (for fear of subjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the King in an absolute obedience)
which increased the hope and courage of the
Rebels, but did the King little good; for the
People either understand not, or will not trouble
themselves with Controversies in writing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his compliance by Messages, go away
with an opinion, That the Parliament was likely
to have the Victory in the War.</p>
               <p>Besides, seeing that the Penners and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of those Papers, were formerly Members
of the Parliament, and of another mind, and now
revolted from the Parliament, because they
could not bear that sway in the House which
they expected, Men were apt to think, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not what they write.</p>
               <p>As for Military Actions (to begin at the
Head-quarters) Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> took <hi>Brinnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram,</hi>
a Garison of the Parliaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:103390:90"/>
In <hi>July,</hi> after the King's Forces had a great
Victory over the Parliaments near <hi>Devizes</hi> on
<hi>Roundway-down,</hi> where they took 2000 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
four Brass-Pieces of Ordnance, 28 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and all their Baggage. And shortly after
<hi>Bristol</hi> was surrender'd to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> for the
King; and the King Himself marching into the
West, took from the Parliament many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
places.</p>
               <p>But this good fortune was not a little allay'd,
by His besieging of <hi>Glocester,</hi> which, after it was
reduc'd to the last gasp, was reliev'd by the Earl
of <hi>Essex,</hi> whose Army was before greatly wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but now recruited with Train'd Bands, and
Apprentices of <hi>London.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It seems not only by this, but also by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Examples in History, That there can hardly
arise a long or dangerous Rebellion, that has not
some such overgrown City, with an Army or two
in its belly, to foment it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nay more, those great Capital Cities,
when Rebellion is upon pretence of Grievances,
must needs be of the Rebel Party, because the
Grievances are but Taxes to which Citizens, that
is Merchants, whose profession in their private
gain are naturally mortal Enemies, their onely
glory being, to grow excessively rich, by the
wisdom of buying and selling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But they are said to be, of all Callings, the
most beneficial to the Commonwealth, by setting
the poorer sort of people on work.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:103390:91"/>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That is to say, by making poor people sell
their labour to them at their own prizes, so that
poor people, for the most part, might get a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Living by working in <hi>Bridewell,</hi> than by spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
weaving, and other such labour as they can
do, saving that by working slightly, they may
help themselves a little, to the disgrace of our
Manufacture. And as most commonly they are
the first Encouragers of Rebellion, presuming in
their strength; so also are they, for the most
part, the first to repent, deceiv'd by them that
command their strength.</p>
               <p>But to return to the War: Though the King
withdrew from <hi>Glocester,</hi> yet it was not to flie
from, but to fight with the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> which
presently after He did at <hi>Newbury,</hi> where the
Battel was bloody, and the King had not the
worst, unless <hi>Cirencester</hi> be put into the Scale,
which the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had in his way a few
days before surpriz'd.</p>
               <p>But in the North and the West the King had
much the better of the Parliament; for in the
North, at the beginning of the year, <hi>May</hi> 29. the
Earls of <hi>Newcastle</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> defeated the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who commanded in those Parts
for the Parliament) at <hi>Bramham-moor,</hi> which
made the Parliament to hasten the assistance of
the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>June</hi> following, the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> (Son to the Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax)</hi>
upon <hi>Adderton-heath,</hi> and in pursuit of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103390:91"/>
them to <hi>Bradford,</hi> took and kill'd 2000 Men, and
the next day took the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 2000 Prisoners
more, (Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> himself hardly escaping)
with all their Arms and Ammunition; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
this made the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> quit <hi>Hallifax,</hi>
and <hi>Beverly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> reliev'd <hi>Newark,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
by Sir <hi>John Meldrum,</hi> for the Parliament,
with 7000 Men, whereof 1000 were slain, the
rest upon Articles departed, leaving behind them
their Arms, Bag and Baggage.</p>
               <p>To balance in part this success, the Earl of
<hi>Manchester,</hi> whose Lieutenant General was <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Cromwel,</hi> got a Victory over the Royalists
near <hi>Horn-Castle,</hi> of which he slew 400, took
800 Prisoners, and 1000 Arms, and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
took and plundered the City of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the West, <hi>May</hi> 16. Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> at
<hi>Stratton</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> had a Victory over the
<hi>Parliamentarians,</hi> wherein he took 1700 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
13 Brass Pieces of Ordnance, and all
their Ammunition, which was 70 Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and their Magazine of their other Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Town.</p>
               <p>Again at <hi>Landsdown,</hi> between Sir <hi>Ralph Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and the <hi>Parliamentarians</hi> under Sir <hi>William
Waller,</hi> was fought a fierce Battel, wherein the
Victory was not very clear on either side, saving
that the <hi>Parliamentarians</hi> might seem to have
the better, because presently after Sir <hi>William
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103390:92"/>
Waller</hi> follow'd Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> to <hi>Devizes</hi> in
<hi>Wiltshire,</hi> though to his cost; for there he was
overthrown, as I have already told you.</p>
               <p>After this, the King in Person marched
into the West, and took <hi>Exeter, Dorcester,
Barnstable,</hi> and divers other places, and had
He not at His Return besieged <hi>Glocester,</hi> and
thereby giving the Parliament time for new
Levies, 'twas thought by many He might have
routed the House of Commons. But the end of
this year was more favourable to the Parliament;
from <hi>January</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> entered <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>March</hi> the first crossed the <hi>Tyne;</hi> and whil'st
the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> was marching to them, Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> gathered together a considerable
Party in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>
from <hi>Lyn</hi> advanced towards <hi>York;</hi> so that the
Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> having two Armies of Rebels
behind him, and another before him, was forced
to retreat to <hi>York,</hi> which those three Armies
joining presently besieged, and these are all
the considerable Military Actions in the year
1643.</p>
               <p>In the same year the Parliament caused to be
made a new great Seal, the Lord Keeper had
carried the former Seal to <hi>Oxford:</hi> Hereupon
the King sent a Messenger to the Judges at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
to forbid them to make use of it; this

               <p>I know not: But, it seems, when a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

address, or notice given to the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that it is presum'd he comes as a Spie.</p>
               <p>The same year, when certain Gentlemen at

the King, to Levy Men for His Service in that

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was not the making of a new great Seal, a
sufficient proof that the War was raised, not to
remove evil Councillors from the King, but to
remove the King Himself from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
what hope then could there be had in
Messages and Treaties?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Entrance of the <hi>Scots</hi> was a thing
unexpected to the King, who was made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
by continual Letters from His Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that the
<hi>Scotch</hi> never intended any Invasion. The Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the King (assur'd that the
<hi>Scotch</hi> were now entered) sent him Prisoner to
<hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle in <hi>Cornwal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of this year 1644. the Earl
of <hi>Newcastle</hi> being (as I told you) besieged
by the joint Forces of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Manchester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> the King
sent Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> to relieve the Town, and as
soon as he could, to give the Enemy Battel;
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> passing through <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103390:93"/>
the way having storm'd the seditious Town of
<hi>Bolton,</hi> and taken in <hi>Stockford</hi> and <hi>Leverpool,</hi>
came to <hi>York, July</hi> 1. and relieved it, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being risen thence, to a place called <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston-moor,</hi>
about four miles off, and there was
fought that unfortunate Battel, that lost the King,
in a manner, all the North; Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
by the way he came, and the Earl of
<hi>Newcastle</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> and thence with some of His
Officers over the Sea to <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Honour of this Victory was attributed
chiefly to <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> (the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>'s
Lieutenant General) the <hi>Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
return'd from the Field, to the Siege of
<hi>York,</hi> which, not long after, upon honourable
Articles was surrendred; not that they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
but because the Parliament employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not much time, nor many men in the
Siege.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B</speaker>
               <p>This was a great and sudden abatement of

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It was so, but amends was made Him for
it within 5 or 6 weeks after; for Sir <hi>William
Waller</hi> (after the loss of his Army at <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-down)</hi>
had another raised for him by the
City of <hi>London,</hi> who, for the payment thereof,
impos'd a weekly Tax of the value of one Meals
meat upon every Citizen. This Army, with that
of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> intended to besiege <hi>Oxford,</hi>
which the King understanding, sent the Queen
into the West, and marched Himself towards
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103390:93"/>
                  <hi>Worcester.</hi> This made them to divide again, and
the Earl to go into the West, and <hi>Waller</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the King. By this means it so fell out, that
both their Armies were defeated; for the King
turn'd upon <hi>Waller,</hi> routed him at <hi>Copredy-Bridge,</hi>
took his Train of Artillery, and many Officers,
and then presently followed the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where he had him at such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that the Earl himself was fain to escape in
a small Boat to <hi>Plymouth;</hi> his Horse broke
through the King's Quarters by night, but the
Infantry were all forc'd to lay down their Arms,
and upon Conditions never more to bear Arms
against the King, were permitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>In <hi>October</hi> following, was fought a second and
sharp Battel at <hi>Newbury;</hi> for this Infantry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no Conscience of the Conditions made with
the King, being now come towards <hi>London,</hi> as
far as <hi>Basing stoke,</hi> had Arms put again into their
hands; to whom some of the Train'd Bands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
added, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had suddenly so
great an Army, that he attempted the King
again at <hi>Newbury;</hi> and certainly had the better
of the day, but the night parting them, had not
a complete Victory. And it was observ'd here,
That no part of the Earls Army fought so keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they who had laid down their Arms in
<hi>Cornwal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were the most important Fights in the
year 1644. and the King was yet (as both Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103390:94"/>
and others thought) in as good a condition
as the Parliament, which despair'd of Victory by
the Commanders then us'd, therefore they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a new modelling of the Army, suspecting
the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> though I think wrongfully, to
be too much a Royalist, for not having done so
much as they look'd for in this second Battel at
<hi>Newbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earls of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Manchester</hi> perceiving
what they went about, voluntarily laid down
their Commissions; and the House of Commons
made an Ordinance, <hi>That no Member of either
House, should enjoy any Office or Command Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or Civil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With which oblique Blow they shook off those
that had hitherto serv'd them too well, and yet
out of this Ordinance they excepted <hi>Oliver
Cromwel,</hi> in whose Conduct and Valor they had
very great confidence, (which they would not
have done, if they had known him as well then,
as they did afterwards) and made him Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General.</p>
               <p>In the Commission to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> there
was a Clause for Preservation of His Majesties
Person, which in this new Commission was left
out, though the Parliament (as well as the
General) were as yet <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>

               <p>For my part, I doubt it not for a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King living, an Usurping Power can never be
sufficiently secur'd. In this same year the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
put to death Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> and his Son,
for tampering with the Earl of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> about
the Rendition of <hi>Hull.</hi> And Sir <hi>Alexander Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w,</hi>
for endeavouring to deliver up <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
where he was Governor for the Parliament. And
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for nothing but
to please the <hi>Scots.</hi> For the general Article of
going about to subvert the Fundamental Laws
of the Land, was no Accusation, but only foul
words.</p>
               <p>They then also voted down the <hi>Book of
Common-Prayer,</hi> and ordered the Use of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi>
which had been newly compos'd by an
Assembly of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers.</p>
               <p>They were also then with much ado prevail'd
with for a Treaty with the King at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi>
where they remitted nothing of their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The King had also at this time a Parliament at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> consisting of such discontented Members
as had left the Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> but few of
them had changed their old Principles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Parliament was not much worth. Nay
rather, because they endeavour'd nothing but
Messages and Treaties; that is to say, defeating
of Soldiers hope of benefit by the War, they
were thought by most Men to do the King more
hurt than good.</p>
               <p>The year 1645. was to the King very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103390:95"/>
for by the loss of one great Battel, He
lost all He had formerly gotten, and at length
His life.</p>
               <p>The new model'd Army, after consultation
whether they should lay Siege to <hi>Oxford,</hi> or
march Westward, to the relief of <hi>Taunton</hi> (then
besieged by the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and defended by
<hi>Blake,</hi> famous afterward for his Actions at Sea)
resolv'd for <hi>Taunton,</hi> leaving <hi>Cromwel</hi> to attend
the motions of the King, though not strong
enough to hinder Him. The King upon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
drew his Forces and Artillery out of
<hi>Oxford.</hi> This made the Parliament to call back
their General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and order him to besiege
<hi>Oxford.</hi> The King in the mean time relieved
<hi>Chester,</hi> which was besieged by Sir <hi>William
Brereton,</hi> and coming back, took <hi>Leicester</hi> by
force, a place of great importance, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of Artillery and Provision. Upon this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
it was generally thought, that the King's
Party was the stronger. The King Himself
thought so, and the Parliament, in a manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the same, by commanding <hi>Fairfax</hi> to rise
from the Siege, and endeavor to give the King
Battel; for the Successors of the King, and the
treacherous divisions growing now among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
had driven them to relie upon the fortune
of one day, in which at <hi>Naseby</hi> the King's Army
was utterly overthrown, and no hope left Him
to raise another; therefore after the Battel he
went up and down, doing the Parliament here
and there some shrewd turns, but never much
increasing His number.</p>

                  <hi>Fairfax</hi> in the mean time first recovered
<hi>Leicester,</hi> and then marching into the West, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
it all, except only a few places, forcing,
with much ado, my Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> (upon hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Conditions) to disband his Army, and with
the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to pass over to <hi>Scilly,</hi> whence
not long after they went to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1646. General <hi>Fairfax</hi> began to
march back to <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the mean time <hi>Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burrough,</hi>
who besieged <hi>Woodstock,</hi> had it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd.
The King therefore, who was now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
return'd to <hi>Oxford,</hi> from whence <hi>Woodstock</hi> is
but six miles, not doubting but that He should
there by <hi>Fairfax</hi> be besieg'd, and having no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to relieve Him, resolv'd to get away disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army about <hi>Newark,</hi> and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he came the 4th of <hi>May;</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Army being upon remove homewards, carried
Him with them to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> whither He came
<hi>May</hi> the 13th.</p>

               <p>Why did the King trust Himself with the
<hi>Scots?</hi> They were the first that Rebell'd. They
were <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> i. e. cruel. Besides, they were
indigent, and consequently might be suspected
would sell Him to His Enemies for money. And
lastly, They were too weak to defend Him, or
keep Him in their Countrey.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What could He have done better? for He
had in the Winter before sent to the Parliament,
to get a Pass for the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and
others, to bring them Propositions of Peace, it
was denied; He sent again, it was denied again.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103390:96"/>
Then He desir'd He might come to them in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
this also was denied. He sent again and again
to the same purpose; but instead of granting it,
they made an Ordinance, <hi>That the Commanders of
the Militia of</hi> London, <hi>in the case the King should
attempt to come within the Line of Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should raise what Force they thought fit to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Tumults, to apprehend such as came with
Him; and to secure</hi> (i. e. to imprison) <hi>His
Person from danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King had adventur'd to come, and had
been imprison'd, what would the Parliament
have done with Him? They had dethron'd Him
by their Votes, and therefore could have no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
while He liv'd, though in Prison; it may be
they would not have put Him to death by a
High Court of Justice publickly, but secretly,
some other way.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That had been from <hi>Oxford</hi> very difficult.
Besides, it was generally believ'd, that the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Army had promis'd Him, that not only His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
but also His Friends that should come with
Him, should be in their Army safe, not only for
their Persons, but also for their Honours and
Consciences. 'Tis a pretty Trick, when the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and the particular Soldiers of that Army
are different things, to make the Soldiers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
what the Army means not to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 11. the Parliament sent their Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the King at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> which Propositions
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103390:96"/>
they pretended to be the onely way to a setled
and well-grounded Peace. They were brought
by the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
Sir <hi>Walter Earl,</hi> Sir <hi>John Hyppesley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> whom the King asked, If they
had power to Treat? And when they said No,
why they might not as well have been sent by
a Trumpeter. The Propositions were the same
dethroning ones which they used to send, and
therefore the King would not assent to them.
Nor did the <hi>Scots</hi> swallow them at first, but made
some Exceptions against them; only it seems, to
make the Parliament perceive they meant not
to put the King into their hands <hi>gratis;</hi> and so
at last the bargain was made between them, and
upon payment of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> the King was put
into the hands of the Commissioners, which the
<hi>English</hi> Parliament sent down to receive Him.</p>

               <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> there had been a Peace made,
by Order from His Majesty, for a time, which
by divisions by the <hi>Irish</hi> was ill kept. The Popish
Party (the Pope's Nuncio being then there)
took this to be the time for delivering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from their subjection to the <hi>English;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the time of the Peace was now expir'd.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How were they subject to the <hi>English,</hi>
more than the <hi>English</hi> to the <hi>Irish?</hi> They were
subject to the King of <hi>England,</hi> but so also were
the <hi>English</hi> to the King of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The distinction is somewhat too subtile for
common understanding. In <hi>Scotland</hi> the Marquis
of <hi>Montross,</hi> for the King with a very few Men
had miraculously with Victories over-run all
<hi>Scotland,</hi> where many of his Forces (out of too
much security) were permitted to be absent
for a while, of which the Enemy having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
suddenly came upon them, and forced
them to flie back into the High-lands to recruit;
where he began to recover strength, when the
King commanded him (being then in the hands
of the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Newcastle)</hi> to disband, and he
departed from <hi>Scotland</hi> by Sea.</p>
               <p>In the end of the same year 1646. the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
caused the King's great Seal to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Also the King was brought to <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and
there kept by the Parliaments Commissioners,
and here was an end of that War as to <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> but not to <hi>Ireland.</hi> About this time
also dyed the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> whom the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had discarded.</p>

               <p>Now that there was Peace in <hi>England,</hi> and

Power?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Right was certainly in the King, but
the exercise was yet in no body, but contended
for, as in a Game at Cards, without fighting all
the years 1647. and 1648. between the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> Lieutenant General to
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi> You must know that when
King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. abolished the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
here, and took upon him to be the Head
of the Church, the Bishops, as they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him, so neither were they discontented with
it. For whereas the Pope before allowed not the
Bishops to claim Jurisdiction in their Diocesses,
<hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that is, of Right immediately from
God, but by the Gift and Authority of the Pope;
now that the Pope was outed, they made no
doubt but the Divine Right was in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>After this the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and divers other
places beyond Sea, having revolted from the
<hi>Papacy,</hi> set up <hi>Presbyteries</hi> for the Government
of thier several Churches; and divers <hi>English</hi>
Scholars that went beyond Sea, during the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were much taken with
this Government; and at their return in the
time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ever since, have
endeavor'd, to the great trouble of the Church
and Nation, to set up that Government here,
wherein they might domineer, and applaud their
own Wit and Learning. And these took upon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103390:98"/>
them not only a Divine Right, but also a Divine
Inspiration; and having been connived at, and
countenanced sometimes in their frequent
Preaching, they introduced many strange and
many pernicious Doctrines, out-doing the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
(as they pretended both of <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Calvin)</hi> receding from the former Divinity, or
Church-Philosophy, (for Religion is another
thing) as much as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> had rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Pope, and distracted their Auditors
into a great number of Sects, as <hi>Brownists, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,
Independents, Fifth-Monarchy Men, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
and divers others, all commonly called by
the name of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> insomuch as there was no
so dangerous an Enemy to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as
this Brood of their own hatching<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>These were <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s best Cards, whereof he
had a very great number in the Army, and some
in the house, whereof he himself was thought
one, though he were nothing certain, but apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself always to the Faction that was
strongest, was of a colour like it. There was in
the Army a great number (if not the part)
that aimed only at Rapine, and sharing the Lands
and Goods of their Enemies; and these also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the opinion they had of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Valor and
Conduct, thought they could not any way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
arrive at their Ends, than by adhering to
him.</p>
               <p>Lastly, In the Parliament it self, though not
the <hi>major</hi> part, yet a considerable number were
Fanaticks, enough to put in doubts, and cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103390:98"/>
in the Resolutions of the House; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
also by advantages of a thin House, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Vote in favour of <hi>Gromwel,</hi> as they did upon
the 26th of <hi>July;</hi> for whereas on the 4th of <hi>May</hi>
precedent, the Parliament had Voted, <hi>That the
Militia of</hi> London <hi>should be in the hands of a
Committee of Citizens, whereof the Lord Mayor,
or the time being, should be one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after the <hi>Independents</hi> chancing to be
the <hi>major,</hi> made an Ordinance, whereby it was
put into hands more favourable to the Army.
The best Cards the Parliament had, were the
City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Person of the King.
The General, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> was right
<hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but in the hands of the Army, and
the Army in the hands of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but which
Party should prevail, depended on playing of the
Game. <hi>Cromwel</hi> protested still Obedience and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to the Parliament, but meaning nothing
less, bethought him, and resolv'd on a way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself of all that he should do to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
upon the Army; therefore he and his Son-in-law,
Commissary General <hi>Ireton,</hi> as good at
contriving as himself, and at speaking and writing,
better contrive how to mutiny the Army against
the Parliament. To this end they spread a whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
through the Army, that the Parliament, now
they had the King, intended to disband them, to
cheat them of their Arrears, and to send them
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be destroy'd by the <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Army being herewith inrag'd, were taught
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103390:99"/>
by <hi>Ireton</hi> to erect a Council among themselves
of two Soldiers out of every Troop, and every
Company to consult for the good of the Army,
and to assist at the Council of War, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom.
These were called Adjutators, so that whatsoever
<hi>Cromwel</hi> would have to be done, he needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to make them to do it, but secretly to put
it into the head of these Adjutators; the effect
of the first Consultation, was to take the King
from <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and to bring him to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>The General hereupon, by Letters to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
excuses himself and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the
Body of the Army, as ignorant of the Fact; and
that the King came away willingly with those
Soldiers that brought Him, assuring them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<hi>That the whole Army intended nothing but
Peace, nor opposed</hi> Presbytery, <hi>nor affected</hi> Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,
<hi>nor did hold any licentious freedom in
Religion.</hi>

               <p>This was the first Trick <hi>Cromwel</hi> play'd,
whereby he thought himself to have gotten so
great an advantage, that he said openly, <hi>That he
had the Parliament in his Pocket,</hi> (as indeed he
had) <hi>and the City too.</hi> For upon the news of it,
they were both the one and the other in very

marching up to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King in the mean time, till his Residence
was setled at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, was carried from
place to place, not without some ostentation; but
with much more Liberty, and with more Respect
shewn Him by far, than when He was in the
hands of the Parliaments Commissioners; for
His own Chaplains were allow'd Him, and His
Children, and some Friends, permitted to see
Him: besides, that He was much Complimented
by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who promised Him in a serious and
seeming passionate manner, to restore Him to
His Right against the Parliament.</p>

               <p>By declaring directly for Him, he might
have had all the King's Party, which were many
more now since His misfortune, than ever they

were many that had discover'd the hypocrisie

converted to their Duty, by their own natural
Reason; and their Compassion for the King's
Sufferings, had begot generally an Indignation
against the Parliament; so that if they had been
by the protection of the present Army brought
together, and embodied, <hi>Cromwel</hi> might have
done what he pleas'd in the first place for the
King, and in the second for himself; but it seems
he meant first to try what he could do without

               <p>But this was soon answer'd, with their own

               <p>The Parliament being thus somewhat aw'd,

               <p>I told you that the Militia of <hi>London</hi> was
on the 4th of <hi>May,</hi> put into the hands of the
Lord Mayor, and other Citizens, and soon after
put into the hands of other Men more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto the Army. And now I am to tell you,
that on <hi>July</hi> 26. the violence of certain Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
and disbanded Soldiers, forced the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to resettle it as it was in the Citizens; and
hereupon the two Speakers, and divers of the
Members, ran away to the Army where they
were invited, and contented to sit and vote in
the Council of War, in the nature of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and out of these Citizens hands they
would have the Militia taken away, and put
again into those hands out of which it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the 26th of <hi>July.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Londoners</hi> mann'd their works, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Line of Communication, rais'd an Army of
valiant Men within the Line, chose good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
all being desirous to go out and fight, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the City should give them Order; and in
that posture stood, expecting the Enemy. The
Soldiers in the mean time enter into an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to live and dye with Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax;</hi>
the Parliament, and the Army.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That's very fine; they imitate that which
the Parliament did, when they first took up Arms

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103390:101"/>
vertually in His Parliament:</hi> So the Army
now making War against the Parliament, called
themselves, the Parliament and the Army; but
they might with more reason say, That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
(since it was in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Pocket) was
virtually in the Army.</p>

               <p>Withall they send out a Declaration of the

they take upon them to be Judges of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and of who are fit to be trusted with
the business of the Kingdom, giving them the
name, not of the Parliament, but of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at <hi>Westminster;</hi> for since the violence they
were under <hi>July</hi> 26. the Army denied them to
be a lawful Parliament.</p>
               <p>At the same time they sent a Letter to the
Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> reproaching
them with those late Tumults, telling them,
<hi>They were Enemies to the Peace, Treacherous to the
Parliament, Vnable to defend either the Parliament
or themselves, and demanded to have the City de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into their hands, to which purpose</hi> (they
said) <hi>they were now coming to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The General also sent out his Warrants to the
Counties adjacent, summoning their Train'd Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to join with them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No, nor at all in Pay, nor could be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Order of Parliament. But what might
not an Army do, that had master'd all the Laws
of the Land?</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:103390:102"/>
The Army being come to <hi>Hounsloe-heath,</hi>
distant from <hi>London</hi> but 10 Miles, the Court of
Aldermen was called, to consider what to do;
the Captains and Soldiers of the City were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and well-provided to go forth, and give
them Battel; but a Treacherous Officer, that
had charge of a work on <hi>Southwark</hi> side, had let
in within the Line a small Party of the Enemies,
who marched as far as to the Gate of <hi>London-Bridge,</hi>
and then the Court of Aldermen (their
hearts failing them) submitted on these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:</p>
               <p>To relinquish their Militia.</p>
               <p>To desert the Eleven Members.</p>
               <p>To deliver up the Forts and Line of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
together with the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and all
Magazines and Arms therein to the Army.</p>
               <p>To disband their Forces, and turn out all the
Reformadoes, <hi>i. e.</hi> all <hi>Essex</hi>'s old Soldiers.</p>
               <p>To draw off their Guards from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>All which was done, and the Army marched
triumphantly through the principal Streets of
the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis strange that the Mayor and Aldermen
having such an Army, should so quickly yield.
Might they not have resisted the Party of the
Enemies at the Bridge, with a Party of their
own, and the rest of the Enemies, with the rest
of their own?</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot judge of that: but to me it
would have been strange if they had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for I consider the most part of rich Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that have made themselves so by Craft and
Trade, as men that never look upon any thing
but their present profit, and who to every thing
not lying in that way are in a manner blind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amaz'd at the very thought of Plundering: If
they had understood what vertue there is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Wealth in obedience to their lawful
Soveraign, they would never have sided with the
Parliament; and so we had had no need of arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
The Mayor and Aldermen therefore assur'd
by this submission to save their Goods, and not
sure of the same by resisting, seem to me to
have taken the wisest course: Nor was the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
less tame than the City, for presently,
<hi>August</hi> 6. the General brought the Fugitive
Speakers and Members to the House with a
strong Guard of Souldiers, and re-placed the
Speakers in their Chairs; and for this they gave
the General thanks, not only there in the House,
but appointed also a day for a holy Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;
and not long after made him <hi>Generalis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Towns and Forts as were not for their
turn, though placed thereby Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

to declare null all that had passed in the

clapt in Prison some of the Lords, and some of

               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> had power enough now to restore
the King, why did he not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>His main end was to set himself in his
place; the restoring of the King was but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
against the Parliament, which being in his
Pocket, he had no more need of the King, who
was now an impediment to him: To keep him
in the Army was a trouble, to let him fall into
the hands of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had been a stop to
his hopes, to murder him privately (besides the
horrour of the act) now whilst he was no more
than Lieutenant General, would have made him
odious, without farthering his design; there was
nothing better for his purpose, than to let him
escape from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> (where he was too
near the Parliament) whither he pleased beyond
Sea: For though <hi>Cromwel</hi> had a great Party in
the Parliament Houses, whilst they saw not his
Ambition to be their Master, yet they would
have been his Enemies as soon as that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.
To make the King attempt an escape,
some of those that had him in Custody, by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
direction told him, that the Adjutators
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103390:103"/>
meant to murder him; and withal, caused a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the same to be generally spread; to the
end it might that way also come to the Kings
Ear, as it did.</p>
               <p>The King therefore in a dark and rainy night
(his Guards being retir'd, as it was thought on
purpose) left <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and went to the
Sea-side, about <hi>Southampton,</hi> where a Vessel had
been bespoken to transport him, but fail'd; so
that the King was forced to trust himself with
Colonel <hi>Hammond,</hi> then Governour of the Isle
of <hi>Wight,</hi> expecting perhaps some kindness from
him for Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> sake, Brother to the
Colonel, and his Majesties much-favour'd Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;
but it prov'd otherwise, for the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
sent to his Masters of the Parliament, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Orders concerning him. This going
into the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> was not likely to be any part
of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s design, who neither knew whither,
nor which way he would go, nor had <hi>Hammond</hi>
known any more than other men, if the Ship had
come to the appointed place in due time.</p>

               <p>If the King had escaped into <hi>France,</hi> might

both of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and all other the Kings

Princes, to favour, so often as they do,
one anothers Rebels, especially when they rebel
against Monarchy it self; they should rather
first make a League against Rebellion, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(if there be no remedy) fight one against
another: Nor will that serve the turn among
Christian Soveraigns, till Preaching be better
lookt to; whereby the Interpretation of a Verse
in the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Bible, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the cause of Civil War, and the deposing
and assassinating of Gods Anointed; and yet
converse with those Divinity Disputers as long
as you will, you will hardly find one in a hundred
discreet enough to be imployed in any great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
either of War or Peace: It is not the
Right of the Soveraign, though granted to him
by every mans consent expresly, that can inable
a Subject to do his Office, it is the obedience of
the Subject; and then by and by to cry out (as
some Ministers did in the Pulpit) <hi>to your Tents,
O Israel!</hi> Common people know nothing of
right or wrong by their own Meditation; they
must therefore be taught the grounds of their
Duty, and the reasons why Calamities ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Disobedience to their lawful Soveraigns:
But to the contrary, our Rebels were publickly
taught Rebellion in the Pulpits, and that there
was no sin, but the doing of what the Preachers
forbad, or the omitting of what they advis'd:
But now the King was the Parliaments Prisoner,
why did not the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> advance their own
Interest, by restoring him?</p>

               <p>The Parliament, in which there were more
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> yet than <hi>Independents,</hi> might have
gotten what they would of the King, during his
life, if they had not by an unconscionable and
sottish Ambition obstructed the way to their
Ends: They sent him four Propositions to be
signed, and past by him as Acts of Parliament,
telling him, when these were granted, they would
send Commissioners to Treat with him of any
other Articles.</p>
               <p>First, The Propositions are these:</p>
               <p>That the Parliament should have the Militia,
and power of levying Money to maintain it for
twenty years; and after that term, the exercise
thereof to return to the King, in case the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
think the safety of the Kingdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This first Article takes from the King the
Militia, and consequently the whole Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for ever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The second was, That the King should ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the proceedings of the Parliament against
himself, and declare void all Oaths and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
made by him against the Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This was to make him guilty of the War,
and of all the Blood spilt therein.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The third was, To take away all Titles of
Honour conferred by the King, since the Great
Seal was carried to him in <hi>May</hi> 1642.</p>
               <p>The fourth was, That the Parliament should
Adjourn themselves, when, and to what place,
and for what time they pleas'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:103390:105"/>
These Propositions the King refus'd to grant,
as he had reason, but sent others of his own,
not much less advantagious to the Parliament,
and desir'd a Personal Treaty with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the settling of the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but the Parliament denying them to be
sufficient for that purpose, voted, that there
should be no more Addresses made to him, nor
Messages receiv'd from him, but they would
settle the Kingdom without him: And this they
voted, partly upon the Speeches and Menaces of
the Army-Faction then present in the House of
Commons, whereof one advised these three
Points.</p>
               <p>1. To secure the King in some In-land Castle
with Guards.</p>
               <p>2. To draw up Articles of Impeachment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
               <p>3. To lay him by, and settle the Kingdom
without him.</p>
               <p>Another said, that his denying the four Bills,
was the denying Protection to his Subjects; and
that therefore they might deny him Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and added, that till the Parliament for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
the Army, the Army would never forsake
the Parliament: This was Threatning. Last of
all, <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself told them, it was now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that the Parliament should govern and
defend the Kingdom, and not any longer let
the people expect their safety from a Man whose
heart God had hardned; nor let those that had
so well defended the Parliament, be left after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103390:105"/>
to the rage of an irreconcileable Enemy,
lest they seek their safety some other way. This
again was threatning; as also laying his hand
upon his Sword when he spake it.</p>
               <p>And hereupon the Vote of Non-Addresses was
made an Ordinance, which the House would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
have recalled, but were forc'd by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
to keep their word.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> were displeas'd with it, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Brethren the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had lost a
great deal of their Power in <hi>England,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
also, because they had sold the King into their
hands. The King now published a passionate
Complaint to his People of this hard dealing
with him, which made them pity him, but not
yet rise in his behalf.</p>

               <p>By no means, there were yet many Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

               <p>1. To be <hi>Generalissimo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To remove the King.</p>

               <p>4. To oppose the <hi>Scots!</hi> And</p>
               <p>Lastly, To dissolve the present Parliament:
Mighty businesses, which he could never promise
himself to overcome; therefore I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he then thought to be King, but only by
serving the strongest Party (which was always

               <p>So shall not I; for it is just such another
piece of Piety, as to turn Men out of an Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
because they are lame: Where can a man
probably learn Godliness, and how to correct
his Vices better, than in the Universities erected
for that purpose?</p>

               <p>It may be the Parliament thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for I have often heard the Complaint of
Parents, that their Children were debauched
there to Drunkenness, Wantonness, Gaming,
and other Vices, consequent to these: Nor is
it a wonder among so many Youths, if they did
not corrupt one another in despite of their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who oftentimes were little Elder than
themselves: And therefore (I think) the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did not much reverence the Institution of
Universities, as to the bringing up of young
men to Vertue, though many of them learn'd
there to Preach, and became thereby capable of
Preferment and Maintenance; and some others
were sent thither by their Parents, to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the trouble of governing them at home,
during that time wherein Children are least go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable.
Nor do I think the Parliament car'd
more for the Clergy than other men did: But
certainly an University is an excellent servant to
the Clergy, and the Clergy if it be not carefully
lookt to, (by their Dissentious Doctrines, and
by the advantage to publish their Dissentions) is
no extraordinary means to divide a Kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Faction.</p>

               <p>But seeing there is no place in this part of

they be learned better, than in the Universities?</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What other Sciences? Do not Divines
comprehend all Civil and Moral Philosophy
within their Divinity? And as for Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103390:107"/>
is it not remov'd from <hi>Oxford</hi> and
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> to <hi>Gresham-College</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and to

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>

               <p>The first Insurrection, or rather Tumult,
was of the Apprentices, on the ninth of <hi>April;</hi>
but this was not upon the Kings account, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
from a customary assembly of them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
in <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> whence some zealous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Train'd-Bands would needs drive
them away by force, but were themselves routed
with stones, and had their Ensign taken away by
the Apprentices, which they carried about in the
Streets, and frighted the Lord Mayor into his
House, where they took a Gun, called a <hi>Drake,</hi>
and then they set Guards at some of the Gates,
and all the rest of the day Childishly swagger'd
up and down: but the next day the General
himself marching into the City, quickly disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them. This was but a small business, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to let them see that the Parliament was ill
belov'd of the people. Next, the <hi>Welch</hi> took
Arms against them; there were three Colonels
in <hi>Wales, Langhorn, Poyer,</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> who had
formerly done the Parliament good services, but
now were commanded to disband, which they
refus'd to do; and the better to strengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
declar'd for the King, and were about
eight thousand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:103390:107"/>
About the same time in <hi>Wales</hi> also was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Insurrection, headed by Sir <hi>Nocholas Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,</hi>
and another under Sir <hi>John Owen;</hi> so that
now all <hi>Wales</hi> was in Rebellion against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
And yet all these were overcome in a
Months time by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and his Officers, but
not without store of blood-shed on both sides.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I do not much pity the loss of those men,

               <p>Presently after this, some of the people of
<hi>Surrey</hi> sent a Petition to the Parliament for a
Personal Treaty between the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but their Messengers were beaten home
again by the Souldiers that quartered about <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster;</hi>
and then the <hi>Kentish</hi> men having a like
Petition to deliver, and seeing how it was like to
be receiv'd, threw it away, and took up Arms;
they had many gallant Officers, and for General,
the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and increas'd daily by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
and old disbanded Souldiers, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the Parliament was glad to restore to
the City their Militia, and to keep Guards upon
the <hi>Thames</hi> side; and then <hi>Fairfax</hi> marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And then the <hi>Londoners,</hi> I think, might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and suddenly have Master'd, first the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and next <hi>Fairfax</hi> his eight thousand, and
lastly <hi>Cromwels</hi> Army, or at least have given the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Army opportunity to march unfought to
<hi>London.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, but the City was never good at
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103390:108"/>
venturing; nor were they, or the <hi>Scots,</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
to have a King over them, but under them.
<hi>Fairfax</hi> marching with eight thousand against
the Royalists, routed a part of them at <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone;</hi>
another part were taking in of places in
<hi>Kent</hi> farther off, and the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> with
the rest, came to <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> and thence sent
to the City to get passage through it, to joyn
with those which were risen in <hi>Essex,</hi> under
Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Lisle;</hi> which
being denied, the greatest part of his <hi>Kentish</hi>
men deserted him; with the rest, not above five
hundred, he crossed the <hi>Thames</hi> unto the Isle of
<hi>Dogs,</hi> and so to <hi>Bow,</hi> and thence to <hi>Colchester:
Fairfax</hi> having notice of this, crossed the
<hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Graves-End,</hi> and overtaking them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
them in <hi>Colchester:</hi> The Town had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
but a Bulwark, and yet held out, upon
hope of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army to relieve them, the
space of two Months.</p>
               <p>Upon the news of the defeat of the <hi>Scots,</hi>
they were forced to yield; the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi>
was sent Prisoner to <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi>
and Sir <hi>George Lisle,</hi> two Loyal and Gallant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
were shot to Death. There was also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little Insurrection headed by the Earl of
<hi>Holland</hi> about <hi>Kingston,</hi> but quickly supprest, and
he himself taken Prisoner.</p>

               <p>How came the <hi>Scots</hi> to be so soon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatcht?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Meerly, as it is said, for want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct:
The Army was led by Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103390:108"/>
was then set at liberty, when <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle,
where he was Prisoner, was taken by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
He entred <hi>England</hi> with Horse and Foot
10000, to which came above 3000 English Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists.
Against these <hi>Cromwel</hi> marched out of
<hi>Wales,</hi> with Horse and Foot 11000, and near to
<hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> in less then two hours, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
them; and the cause of it is said to be,
that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was so ordered, as they
could not all come to the Fight, nor relieve their
Fellows: After the Defeat they had no way to
fly but farther into <hi>England,</hi> so that in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
they were almost all taken, and lost all that
an Army could lose, for the few that got home,
did not all bring home their Swords, Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was taken, and not long after sent to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
but <hi>Cromwel</hi> marched to <hi>Edenburrough,</hi> and
there, by the help of the Faction which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s, he made sure not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in his designs, the first whereof was to take
away the Kings Life by the hand of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
whilst these things passed in the North,
the Parliament <hi>(Cromwel</hi> being away) came to it
self, and recalling their Vote of <hi>Non-Addresses,</hi>
sent to the King new Propositions, somewhat,
but not much easier than the former, and upon
the King's answer to them, they sent Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to treat with him at <hi>Newport</hi> in the Isle of
<hi>Wight,</hi> where they so long dodged with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Trifles, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was come to <hi>London</hi>
before they had done, to the Kings destruction,
for the Army was now wholly at the Devotion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103390:109"/>
of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who set the Adjutators on work to
make a Remonstrance to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
wherein they require: 1. That the King
be brought to Justice. 2. That the Prince, and
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> be summon'd to appear at a day
appointed, and proceeded with, according as
they should give satisfaction. 3. That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
settle the future Government, and set
a reasonable period to their own sitting, and
make certain future Parliaments Annual, or
Biennial. 4. That a competent number of the
Kings chief Instruments be executed; and this
to be done both by the House of Commons,
and by a general agreement of the people, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by their Subscriptions: Nor did they stay
for an answer, but presently set a Guard of
Souldiers at the Parliament-House Door, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Souldiers in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> suffering none
to go into the House, but such as would serve
their turns; all others were frighted away, or
made Prisoners, and some upon divers quarrels
suspended. About ninety of them, because they
had refus'd to Vote against the <hi>Scots;</hi> and others,
because they had voted against the Vote of Non-Addresses;
and the rest were a House for <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
The Phanaticks also in the City being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by the Army, pack a new Common
Council, whereof any forty was to be above the
Mayor, and their first work was to frame a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
for Justice against the King; which <hi>Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi>
the Mayor (involving the City in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide)
deliver'd to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:103390:109"/>
At the same time, with like violence they took
the King from <hi>Newport,</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to
<hi>Hurst</hi> Castle, till things were ready for his
Tryal; the Parliament, in the mean time, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
Perjury, by an Ordinance declar'd void
the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; and
presently after made another to bring the King
to his Tryal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Ordinance being drawn up, was
brought into the House, where after three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
readings, it was voted, <hi>That the Lords and
Commons of</hi> England <hi>assembled in Parliament, do
declare, that by the Fundamental Laws of the Realm,
it is Treason in the King of</hi> England <hi>to levy War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament:</hi> And this Vote was sent
up to the Lords, and they denying their consent,
the Commons in anger made another Vote, <hi>That
all Members of Committees should proceed and act in
any Ordinance, whether the Lords concurr'd or no;
and that the People, under God, are the Original of
all just Power; and that the House of Commons
have the Supreme Power of the Nation; and that
whatsoever the House of Commons Enacted, is Law.</hi>
All this passed <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>These Propositions fight not only against a
King of <hi>England,</hi> but against all the Kings of the
World: It were good they thought on't; but
yet I believe, that, under God, the Original of all
Laws was in the People.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But the People, for them and their Heirs,
by consent and Oaths, have long ago put the
Supreme Power of the Nation into the hands of
their Kings, for them and their Heirs; and
consequently into the hands of this King, their

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But does not the Parliament represent the

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, to some purposes; as to put up Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the King when they have leave, and are
griev'd; but not to make a grievance of the
Kings Power: Besides, the Parliament never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the People, but when the King calls
them: Is it to be imagin'd, that he calls a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to depose himself? Put the case every
County and Burrough should have given for a
benevolence a sum of Money, and that every
County meeting in their County Court, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and that every Burrough in their Town-Hall,
should have chosen certain men to carry
their several sums respectively to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had not these men represented the whole
Nation?</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think the Parliament would have

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No, sure; and yet, I must confess, the Case

               <p>
                  <hi>This Ordinance contained; First, a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
of the Charge against the King; in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
this,</hi> That not content with the Incroachments
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103390:110"/>
of his Predecessors upon the freedom of the People,
he had design'd to set up a Tyrannical Power; and
to that end, had rais'd and maintain'd in the Land
a Civil War against the Parliament, whereby the
Country hath been miserably wasted, the Publick
Treasure exhausted, thousands of people murdered,
and infinite other mischiefs committed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Constitution passed of a High
Court of Justice; that is, of a certain number
of Commissioners, of whom any twenty had
power to try the King, and proceed to Sentence,
according to the Merit of the Cause, and see it
speedily executed. The Commissioners met on
Saturday, <hi>January</hi> 20. in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and
the King was brought before them, sitting in a
Chair: He heard the Charge read, but denied
to plead to it, either Guilty, or not Guilty, till
he should know by what lawful Authority he was
brought thither: The President told him, that
the Parliament affirm'd their own Authority;
and the King persevered in his refusal to plead;
though many words passed between him and the
President, yet this is the sum of all: on Monday,
<hi>January</hi> 22. the Court met again, and the Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor
moved, that if the King persisted in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Authority of the Court, the Charge
might be taken <hi>pro confesso;</hi> but the King still
denied their Authority.</p>
               <p>They met again, <hi>January</hi> 23. and then the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor
moved the Court for Judgment; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King was requir'd to give his Final An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which was again a denial of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:103390:111"/>
Lastly, They met again, <hi>January</hi> 27. where
the King then desir'd to be heard before the
Lords and Commons in the <hi>Painted Chamber;</hi>
and promising after that to abide the Judgment
of the Court; the Commissioners retir'd for half
an hour to consider of it; and then returning,
caused the King again to be brought to the Bar,
and told him, that what he propos'd, was but
another denial of the Courts Jurisdiction; and
that if he had no more to say, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to Judgment: Then the King answering,
that he had no more to say, the President began
a long Speech, in justification of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
proceedings, producing the Examples of
many Kings kill'd or depos'd by wicked Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Ancient and Modern, in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and other parts of the World: All which
he endeavour'd to justifie from this only Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the People have the Supreme Power,
and the Parliament is the People. This Speech
ended, the Sentence of Death was read, and the
same upon Tuesday after, <hi>January</hi> the 30. execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the Gate of his own Palace of <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
He that can delight in reading how villanously
he was used by the Souldiers, between the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and Execution, may go to the Chronicle
it self, in which he shall see what courage, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
wisdom, and goodness was in this Prince,
whom in their Charge the Members of that
wicked Parliament stil'd Traytor, Tyrant, and
Murderer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King being dead, the same day they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103390:111"/>
made an Act of Parliament,</hi> That whereas seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pretences might be made to the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is
Enacted by this present Parliament, and Authority
of the same, that no Person shall presume to declare,
proclaim, or publish, or any way promote <hi>Charles
Stuart,</hi> Son of <hi>Charles</hi> late King of <hi>England,</hi>
commonly called Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> or any other
Person, to be King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing the King was dead, and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
barr'd, by what declar'd Authority was
the Peace maintained?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They had in their anger against the Lords
formerly declar'd the Supreme Power of the
Nation to be in the House of Commons; and
now, on <hi>February</hi> the fifth, they Vote the
House of Lords to be useless, and dangerous.
And thus the Kingdom was turn'd into a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi>
or rather an <hi>Oligarchy;</hi> for presently they
made an Act, That none of those Members who
were secluded for opposing the Vote of Non-Addresses,
should ever be re-admitted: And these
were commonly called the Secluded Members,
and the rest were by some stiled a Parliament,
and by others a Rump.</p>
               <p>I think you need not now have a Catalogue
either of the Vices, or of the Crimes, or of the
Follies of the greatest part of them that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Long-Parliament, than which greater
cannot be in the World: What greater Vices
than Irreligion, Hypocrisie, Avarice, and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which have appear'd so eminently in the
actions of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Members, and <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:103390:112"/>
Ministers? What greater Crimes than Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy,
and killing Gods Anointed, which was
done by the hands of the <hi>Independents,</hi> but by
the folly and first Treason of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
who betrayed and sold him to his Murderers?
Nor was it a little folly in the Lords, not to see
that by the taking away of the Kings Power,
they lost withall their own Priviledges; or to
think themselves either for number or judgment
any way a considerable assistance to the House of
Commons: And for those men who had skill in
the Laws, it was no great sign of understanding,
not to perceive that the Laws of the Land were
made by the King, to oblige his Subjects to
Peace and Justice, and not to oblige himself
that made them: Lastly, and generally, all men
are Fools which pull down any thing which does
them good, before they have set up something
better in its place: He that would set up <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy</hi>
with an Army, should have an Army to
maintain it; but these men did it, when those
men had the Army that were resolv'd to pull it
down. To these follies, I might add the follies
of those five men, which out of their reading of
<hi>Tully, Seneca,</hi> and other <hi>Antimonarchicks,</hi> think
themselves sufficient Politicks, and shew their
discontents when they are not called to the
management of the State, and turn from one side
to the other upon every neglect they fancy from
the King, or his Enemies.</p>

               <p>'Tis doubtless an <hi>Oligarchy;</hi> for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority must needs be in one man, or in
in more; if in one, it is <hi>Monarchy;</hi> the Rump
therefore was no <hi>Monarchy;</hi> if the Authority
were in more than one, it was in all, or in fewer

man may enter into the Assembly which makes
the Soveraign Court, which they could not do

was in a few, and consequently the State was an
<hi>Oligarchy.</hi>

               <p>It is not impossible for a people to be well

one.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Both the Rump, and all other Soveraign
Assemblies, if they have but one voice, though
they be many men, yet are they but one Person;
for contrary Commands cannot consist in one

well enough, if they had honesty and wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>

The first Act of the Rump, was the Exclusion
of those Members of the House of Commons
which had been formerly kept out by violence,
for the procuring of an Ordinance for the Kings
Tryal; for these men had appear'd against the
Ordinance of Non-Addresses, and therefore to
be excluded, because they might else be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to their future designs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was it not rather, because in the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of few, they thought the fewer the better,
both in regard of their shares, and also of a
nearer approach in every one of them to the
Dignity of a King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes certainly, that was their principal

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When these were put out, why did not the

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They could not do that without Order
from the House: After this, they constituted a
Council of forty persons, which they termed a
Council of State, whose Office was to execute
what the Rump should command.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When there was neither King, nor House
of Lords, they could not call themselves a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
for a Parliament is a meeting of the
King, Lords, and Commons, to confer together
about the businesses of the Common-wealth: with
whom did the Rump confer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Men may give to their Assembly what
Name they please, what signification soever such
Name might formerly have had, and the Rump
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103390:113"/>
took the Name of Parliament, as most suitable
to their purpose; and such a Name, as being Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
among the people for many hundred
years, had countenanced and sweetned Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and other Levies of Money, otherwise ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unpleasant to the Subject: They took also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
another name, which was, <hi>Custodes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis
Angliae,</hi> which Title they used only in
their Writs issuing out of the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>

               <p>I do not see how a Subject that is tyed to

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Howsoever, to the people that understand
by Liberty, nothing but leave to do what they
list, it was a Title not ingrateful.</p>
               <p>Their next work was to set forth a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
that they were fully resolv'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, as to
the preservation of the Lives, Liberties, and
Proprieties of the people.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What did they mean by the Fundamental
Laws of the Nation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing but to abuse the people; for the
only Fundamental Law in every Commonwealth,
is to obey the Laws from time to time, which
he shall make, to whom the People have given
the Supreme Power: How likely then are they
to uphold the Fundamental Laws, that had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him, who was by themselves so often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
their lawful Soveraign: Besides, at
the same time that this Declaration came forth,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103390:114"/>
they were erecting the High Court of Justice,
which took away the lives of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Capel;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they meant by a Fundamentall Law, the
erecting of this Court was a breach of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
warranted by no former Law, or Example in
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time also they levied Taxes by
Souldiers, and permitted Free Quarter to them;
and did many other Actions, which if the King
had done, they would have said had been done
against the Liberty and Propriety of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What silly things are the common sort of
people, to be cozen'd as they were so grosly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What sort of people, as to this matter,
are not of the common sort; the craftiest
Knaves of all the Rump were no wiser than the
rest whom they cozen'd; for the most of them did
believe, that the same things which they impos'd
upon the generality, were just and reasonable; and
especially the great Haranguers, and such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to Learning: for who can be a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in a Monarchy, whose Principles are taken
from the Enemies of Monarchy? such as were
<hi>Cicero, Seneca, Cato,</hi> and other Polititians of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> who spake of
Kings but as Wolves, and other ravenous Beasts?
You may perhaps think a man has need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, to know the duty he owes to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
and what right he has to order him,
but a good Natural Wit: But it is otherwise;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103390:114"/>
for it is a Science, and built upon sure and clear
Principles, and to be learn'd by deep and careful
study, or from Masters that have deeply studied
it: And who was there in the Parliament, or in
the Nation, that could find out those evident
Principles, and derive from thence the necessary
Rules of Justice, and the necessary Connexion
of Justice and Peace? The people have one day
in seven the leisure to hear Instructions, and
there are Ministers appointed to teach them
their duty: But how have these Ministers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
their Office? A great part of them,
namely, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, throughout
the whole War, instigated the people against the
King; so did also <hi>Independent,</hi> and other fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Ministers: The rest contented with their
Livings, preached in their Parishes points of
Controversie, to Religion importinent, but to
the breach of Charity, among themselves, very
effectual; or else Eloquent things, which the
people either understood not, or thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
not concern'd in: But this sort of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
as they did little good, so they did little
hurt; the mischief proceeded wholly from the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers, who by a long practis'd
Histrionick Faculty, preached up the Rebellion
powerfully.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>To the end, that the State becoming po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular,
the Church might be so too, and govern'd
by an Assembly; and consequently (as they
thought) seeing Politicks are subservient to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103390:115"/>
Religion, they might govern, and thereby satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their covetous humour with Riches, and also
their malice with Power to undo all men that
admir'd not their wisdom. Your calling the
people silly things, oblig'd me by this digression
to shew you, that it is not want of Wit, but
want of the Science of Justice that brought
them into these troubles. Perswade, if you can,
that man that has made his Fortune, or made it
greater, or an Eloquent Orator, or a ravishing
Poet, or a subtil Lawyer, or but a good Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or a cunning Gamester, that he has not a
good Wit; and yet there were of all these a
great many so silly as to be deceived by the
Rump. They wanted not wit, but the knowledge
of the Causes, and grounds upon which one
person has a right to govern, and the rest an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to obey; which grounds are necessary
to be taught the people, who without them
cannot live long in peace among themselves.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In the rest of the year, they voted a new
Stamp for the Coyn of this Nation: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
also of Agents to be sent into foreign
parts; and having lately receiv'd Applause
from the Army for their work done by the High
Court of Justice, and encouragement to extend
the same farther, they perfected the said High
Court of Justice, in which were tryed Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen;</hi> whereof
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103390:115"/>
(as I mention'd before) the first three were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.
This affrighted divers of the Kings
Party out of the Land, for not only they, but
all that had born Arms for the King, were at
that time in very great danger of their lives:
for it was put to the question by the Army at a
Council of War, whether they should be all
massacred or no; where the <hi>No</hi>'s carried it but
by two Voices. Lastly, <hi>March</hi> 24. they put the
Mayor of <hi>London</hi> out of his Office, fined him
two thousand pound, disfranchised him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
him to two Months imprisonment in the
<hi>Tower,</hi> for refusing to proclaim the Act for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing
of the Kingly Power. And thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the year 1648. and the Monthly Fast, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
granted that which they fasted for, the
Death of the King, and the possession of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
By these their proceedings, they had
already lost the hearts of the generality of the
people, and had nothing to trust to but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which was not in their power, but in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s,
who never fail'd, when there was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to put them upon all Exploits that might
make them odious to the people, in order to his
future dissolving them, whensoever it should
conduce to his ends. In the beginning of 1649.
the <hi>Scots</hi> discontented with the proceedings of
the Rump against the late King, began to levy
Souldiers, in order to a new Invasion of <hi>England.</hi>
The <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, for want of timely resistance
from <hi>England,</hi> were grown terrible; and the
<hi>English</hi> Army at home, infected by the Adjuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103390:116"/>
began to cast about, how to share the
Land among the Godly, meaning themselves,
and such others as they pleas'd, who were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Levellers:</hi> Also the Rump, for the
present, were not very well provided of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and therefore the first thing they did, was
the laying of a Tax upon the people, of ninety
thousand pound a Month, for the Maintenance of
the Army.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was it not one of their Quarrels with
the King, that he had levied Money without the
consent of the people in Parliament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You may see by this what reason the
Rump had to call it self a Parliament; for the
Taxes imposed by Parliament, were always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to be by the peoples consent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
legal.</p>
               <p>To appease the <hi>Scots,</hi> they sent Messengers
with flattering Letters, to keep them from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
for the present King; but in vain, for
they would hear nothing from a House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(as they call'd it) at <hi>Westminster,</hi> without
a King, and Lords: But they sent Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to the King, to let him know what they were
doing for him, for they were resolv'd to raise
an Army of seventeen thousand Foot, and six
thousand Horse for themselves. To relieve
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the Rump had resolv'd to send eleven
Regiments thither out of the Army in <hi>England.</hi>
This happened well for <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for the Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Souldiers, which were in every Regiment
many, and in some the major part, finding that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103390:116"/>
instead of dividing the Land at home, they were
to venture their lives in <hi>Ireland,</hi> flatly denied to
go; and one Regiment having cashier'd their
Colonel about <hi>Salisbury,</hi> was marching to joyn
with three Regiments more of the same resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but both the General, and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon them at <hi>Burford,</hi> utterly defeated them,
and soon after reduced the whole Army to their
obedience: And thus another of the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Advancement was soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd.
Thus done, they came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
thence to <hi>London;</hi> and at <hi>Oxford,</hi> both the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> were made Doctors of the
Civil Law; and at <hi>London</hi> feasted and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the City.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Were they not first made Masters, then
Doctors?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They had made themselves Masters alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
both of the Laws, and Parliament. The
Army being now obedient, the Rump sent over
those eleven Regiments into <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the
Command of Doctor <hi>Cromwel,</hi> entituled, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of that Kingdom, the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still General of all the Forces, both here, and
there.</p>
               <p>The Marquess, now Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> was the
Kings Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Rebels
had made a Confederacy among themselves, and
those Confederates had made a kind of League
with the Lieutenant, wherein they agreed upon
liberty given them in the exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to be faithful to, and assist the King. To
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103390:117"/>
these also were joyned some Forces raised by
the Earls of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> and <hi>Clanriccard,</hi> and my
Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> so that they were the greatest
United Strength in the Island; but there were
among them a great many other <hi>Papists</hi> that
would by no means subject themselves to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
and these were called the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the other were called the Confederate
Party. These Parties not agreeing, and the
Confederate Party having broken their Articles,
the Lord Lieutenant seeing them ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
him in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and not able to defend it;
to preserve the place for the <hi>Protestants,</hi> surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and came
over to the King, at this time when he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
from place to place by the Army. From
<hi>England</hi> he went over to the Prince, now King,
residing then at <hi>Paris:</hi> But the Confederates af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
with the news that the Rump was send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over an Army thither, desir'd the Prince,
by Letters, to send back my Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
ingaging themselves to submit absolutely to the
Kings Authority, and to obey my Lord of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
as his Lieutenant: And thereupon he was
sent back. This was about a year before the
going over of <hi>Cromwel;</hi> in which time, by the
Dissentions in <hi>Ireland</hi> between the Confederate
Party, and the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s Party, and discontents
about Command, this otherwise sufficient Power
effected nothing, and was at last defeated, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi>
the second, by a Salley out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which
they were besieging. Within a few days after
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103390:117"/>
arriv'd <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who with extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and horrid Executions, in less than a
Twelvemonth that he staid there, subdued, in a
manner, the whole Nation, having kill'd or
exterminated a great part of them, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Son-in-law <hi>Ireton</hi> to subdue the rest:
But <hi>Ireton</hi> died there (before the business was
quite done) of the Plague. This was one step
more towards <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Exaltation to the
Throne.</p>

their Agent <hi>Dorislaus,</hi> Doctor of the Civil Law,

night he came, as he was at Supper, a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

kill'd him, and got away. Not long after
also, their Agent at <hi>Madrid,</hi> one <hi>Ascham,</hi> that

kill'd in the same manner. About this time
came out two Books; one written by <hi>Salmasius,</hi>

Latine both, and hardly to be judged which is

better; and both very ill reasoning, and hardly
to be judged which is worst: like two Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> for exercise only in a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick

               <p>
                  <hi>In this year the</hi> Rump <hi>did not much at
home, save that in the beginning they made</hi>
England <hi>a Free State, by an Act which runs thus,</hi>
Be it Enacted and Declared by this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by to Authority thereof, That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England,</hi> and all the Dominions and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
thereunto belonging, are and shall be, and are
hereby constituted, made, and declared a Common-wealth,
and Free State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What did they mean by a Free State and
Common-wealth? were the people no longer
to be subject to Laws? They could not mean
that: for the Parliament meant to Govern them
by their own Laws, and punish such as broke
them. Did they mean that <hi>England</hi> should not
be subject to any foreign Kingdom or Common-wealth?
That needed not be Enacted, seeing
there was no King nor People pretended to be
their Masters. What did they mean then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They meant that neither this King, nor
any King, nor any single person, but only that
they themselves would be the Peoples Masters;
and would have set it down in those plain words,
if the people could have been cozen'd with
words intelligible as easily as with words not
intelligible.</p>
               <p>After this they gave one another Money and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103390:118"/>
Estates out of the Lands and Goods of the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Party. They Enacted also an Engagement to
be taken by every man, in these words, <hi>You shall
promise to be true and faithful to the Common-wealth
of</hi> England, <hi>as it is now established, without King
or House of Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They banished also from within 20 Miles of
<hi>London</hi> all the loyal Party, forbidding every
one of them to depart more than five Miles
from his dwelling-house.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>They meant perhaps to have them ready,
if need were, for a Massacre: But what did the
<hi>Scots</hi> in this time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They were considering of the Officers of
the Army which they were levying for the King,
how they might exclude from Command all
such as had loyally serv'd his now Majesty's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all Independents, and all such as
commanded in Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Army: And
these were the main things that passed this year.</p>
               <p>The Marquess of <hi>Montross,</hi> that had in the
year 1645. with a few men, and in a little time,
done things almost incredible against the late
King's Enemies in <hi>Scotland,</hi> landed now again
in the beginning of the Year 1650. in the
North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Commission from the
present King, hoping to do him as good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as he had formerly done his Father; but
the case was alter'd, for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces were
then in <hi>England,</hi> in the service of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
whereas now they were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
many more (for their intended Invasion) newly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103390:119"/>
rais'd: Besides, the Souldiers which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
brought over were few, and Forreigners;
nor did the <hi>High-landers</hi> come in to him, as he
expected, insomuch as he was soon defeated, and
shortly after taken; and (with more spiteful u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
than revenge requir'd) Executed by the
Covenanters at <hi>Edinborough, May</hi> the 2d.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What good could the King expect from
joyning with these men, who, during the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
discover'd so much malice to him in one of
his best Subjects?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt (their Church-men being then
prevalent) they would have done as much to
this King, as the <hi>English</hi> Parliament had done to
his Father, if they could have gotten by it that
which they foolishly aspir'd to, the Government
of the Nation: I do not believe that the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi>
were worse than the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> both
the one and the other were resolv'd to destroy
whatsoever should stand in the way to their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition:
but necessity made the King pass over
both this and many other Indignities from them,
rather than suffer the pursuit of his Right in
<hi>England</hi> to cool, and be little better than extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, I believe the Kingdom, if suffered
to become an old Debt, will hardly ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd:
Besides, the King was sure, where ever
the Victory lighted, he could lose nothing in
the War but Enemies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>About the time of <hi>Montrosses</hi> death, which
was in <hi>May, Cromwel</hi> was yet in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103390:119"/>
work unfinished; but finding, or by his Friends
advertis'd, that his presence in the Expedition
now preparing against the <hi>Scots,</hi> would be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to his Design, sent to the Rump, to know
their pleasure, concerning his return: But for
all that, he knew, or thought it was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to stay for their Answer, but came away, and
arriv'd at <hi>London</hi> the sixth of <hi>June</hi> following,
and was welcom'd by the Rump. Now had
General <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who was truly what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be, a <hi>Presbyterian)</hi> been so Catechis'd
by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers here, that he refus'd
to fight against the Brethren in <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor did
the Rump, nor <hi>Cromwel,</hi> go about to rectifie his
Conscience in that point. And thus <hi>Fairfax</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down his Commission, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was now
made General of all the Forces in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which was another step to the Soveraign
Power.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> newly come over, he landed
in the <hi>North,</hi> and was honourably conducted to
<hi>Edinborough,</hi> though all things was not yet well
agreed upon between the <hi>Scots</hi> and him: for he
had yielded to as hard Conditions, as the late
King had yielded to in the Isle of <hi>Wight;</hi> yet
they had still somewhat to add, till the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
no more, departed from them towards
the <hi>North</hi> again: But they sent Messengers after
him, to pray him to return; but they furnished
these Messengers with strength enough to bring
him back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he should have refus'd. In fine,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103390:120"/>
they agreed, but would not suffer the King, or
any Royalist, to have Command in the Army.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The sum of all is, the King was their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> from <hi>Berwick</hi> sends a Declaration
to the <hi>Scots,</hi> telling them, he had no Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but against the
Malignant Party that had brought in the King,
to the disturbance of the Peace between the two
Nations; and that he was willing by Conference
to give and receive satisfaction, or to decide
the Justice of the Cause by Battel: To which the
<hi>Scots</hi> answering, declare, That they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the Kings Interest, before and without his
acknowledgment of the sins of his House, and
his former ways; and satisfaction given to Gods
people in both Kingdoms. Judge by this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the present King were not in as bad a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here, as his Father was in the hands of the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are every where the same;
they would fain be absolute Governours of all
they converse with, and have nothing to plead
for it; but that where they reign, 'tis God that
reigns, and no where else. But I observe one
strange demand, that the King should acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the sins of his House; for I thought it had
been certain from all Divines, that no man was
bound to acknowledge any mans sins but his
own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The King having yielded to all that the
Church requir'd, the <hi>Scots</hi> proceeded in their
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103390:120"/>
intended War. <hi>Cromwel</hi> marched on to <hi>Edinbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
provoking them all he could to Battel;
which they declining, and provisions growing
scarce in the <hi>English</hi> Army, <hi>Cromwel</hi> retir'd to
<hi>Dunbar,</hi> despairing of success, and intending
by Sea or Land to get back into <hi>England:</hi> And
such was the condition which this General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
so much magnified for Conduct, had brought
his Army to, that all his Glories had ended in
shame and punishment, if Fortune's, and the
faults of his Enemies, had not reliev'd him: for
as he retir'd, the <hi>Scots</hi> followed him close all the
way, till within a mile of <hi>Dunbar.</hi> There is a
ridge of Hills, that from beyond <hi>Edinborough</hi>
goes winding to the Sea, and crosses the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
between <hi>Dunbar</hi> and <hi>Barwick,</hi> at a Village
called <hi>Copperspeith,</hi> where the passage is so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
that if the <hi>Scots</hi> had sent timely thither a
very few men to guard it, the <hi>English</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have passed: for the <hi>Scots</hi> kept the Hills,
and needed not have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ought, but upon great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and were almost two to one. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
Army was at the Foot of those Hills, on the
<hi>North</hi> side; and there was a great Ditch, or
Channel of a Torrent, between the Hills and it;
so that he could never have got home by Land,
nor without utter ruine of the Army attempted
to ship it, nor have stayed where he was for
want of provisions. Now <hi>Cromwel</hi> knowing the
Pass was free, and commanding a good Party of
Horse and Foot to possess it, it was necessary for
the <hi>Scots</hi> to let them go, whom they brag'd they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103390:121"/>
had impounded, or else to fight, and therefore
with the best of their Horse charged the <hi>English,</hi>
and made them at first to shrink a little, but the
<hi>English</hi> Foot coming on, the <hi>Scots</hi> were put to
flight, and the flight of their Horse hindred the
Foot from engaging, who therefore fled, as did
also the rest of their Horse. Thus the folly of the
<hi>Scotish</hi> Commanders brought all these odds to an
even lay between two small and equal Parties,
wherein Fortune gave the Victory to the <hi>English,</hi>
who were not many more in number than those
that were killed and taken Prisoners of the <hi>Scots,</hi>
and the Church lost their Cannon, Bag and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
with 10000 Arms, and almost their whole
Army; the rest were got together by <hi>Lesby</hi> to
<hi>Sterling.</hi>

               <p>This Victory hapned well for the King,
for had the <hi>Scots</hi> been Victors, the Presbyterians
both there and here would have domineer'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and the King been in the same condition
his Father was in at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> in the hands of
the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army. For in pursuit of this Victory,
the <hi>English</hi> at last brought the <hi>Scots</hi> to a pretty
good habit of obedience for the King, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he should recover his Right.</p>

               <p>In pursuit of this Victory the <hi>English</hi>
marched to <hi>Edinborrough,</hi> quitted by the <hi>Scots,</hi>
fortified <hi>Leith,</hi> and took in all the strength and
Castles they thought fit on this side the <hi>Frith,</hi>
which now was become the Bounds betwixt the
two Nations; and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ecclesiasticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to know themselves better, and resolved
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103390:121"/>
in their new Army, which they meant to raise,
to admit some of the Royalists into Command:
<hi>Cromwel</hi> from <hi>Edinborrough</hi> march'd towards
<hi>Sterling</hi> to provoke the Enemy to fight, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
danger in it returned to <hi>Edinborrough,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
the Castle: In the mean time he sent a
Party into the West of <hi>Scotland</hi> to suppress
<hi>Strangham</hi> and <hi>Kerr,</hi> two great Presbyterians,
that were there levying of Forces for their new
Army. And in the same time the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King at <hi>Schone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rest of this year was spent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> on
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s part in taking of <hi>Edinburrough</hi> Castle,
and in attempts to pass the <hi>Frith,</hi> or any other
ways to get over to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Forces; and on
the <hi>Scots</hi> part, in hastening their Levies for the

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They voted Liberty of Conscience to the
Sectaries; that is, they pluckt out the sting of
Presbytery, which consisted in a severe imposing
of odd Opinions upon the people, impertinent
to Religion, but conducing to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the power of the Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
Also they levyed more Souldiers, and
gave the Command of them to <hi>Harrison,</hi> now made
Major General, a Fifth-Monarchy man; and of
those Souldiers, two Regiments of Horse and
one of Foot were raised by the Fifth-Monarchy
men, and other Sectaries, in thankfulness for
this their liberty from the Presbyterian Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103390:122"/>
Also they pull'd down the late Kings Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and in the place where it
stood caused to be written these words, <hi>Exit
Tyrannus Regum ultimus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What good did that do them? and why

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What account can be given of actions that
proceed not from Reason, but spight and such
like passions? Besides this, they received Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
from <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Power: And in the very end of the
year, they prepared an Ambassador to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
to offer them friendship: All they
did besides, was persecuting and executing of
Royalists.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Year 1651. General
<hi>Dean</hi> arrived in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and on the 11th. of
<hi>April</hi> the <hi>Scotish</hi> Parliament assembled, and made
certain Acts in order to a better uniting of
themselves, and better obedience to the King,
who was now at <hi>Sterling</hi> with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Forces
he had, expecting more now in levying. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
from <hi>Edinborough</hi> went divers times to <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
to provoke them to fight: There was no
Ford there to pass over his men: At last, Boats
being come from <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Newcastle,</hi> Colonel
<hi>Overton</hi> (though it were long first, for it was
now <hi>July)</hi> transported 1400 Foot of his own,
besides another Regiment of Foot and four
Troops of Horse, and intrencht himself at
<hi>North-Ferry</hi> on the other side, and before any
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103390:122"/>
help could come from <hi>Sterling</hi> Major General
<hi>Lambert</hi> also was got over with as many more;
by this time Sir <hi>John Brown</hi> was come to oppose
them with 4500 men, whom the <hi>English</hi> there
defeated, killing about 2000, aud taking Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
1600. This done, and as much more of
the Army transported as was thought fit, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
comes before <hi>St. Johnston</hi>'s (from whence
the <hi>Scotish</hi> Parliament, upon news of his passing
the <hi>Frith,</hi> was removed to <hi>Dundee)</hi> and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
it; and the same day had news brought
him, that the King was marching from <hi>Sterling</hi>
towards <hi>England,</hi> which was true; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the King was three days march before
him, he resolved to have the Town before he
followed him, and accordingly had it the next

               <p>What hopes had the King in coming into

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes there was before him the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which generally hated the Rump, and might
easily be reckoned for 20000 well armed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
and most men believed they would have

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What probability was there of that? Do
you think the Rump was not sure of the service
of the Mayor, and those that Commanded the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Militia? And if they had been really the Kings
Friends, what need had they to stay his coming
up to <hi>London?</hi> They might have seiz'd the Rump
if they had pleas'd, which had no possibility
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103390:123"/>

               <p>This they did not, but on the contrary
permitted the recruiting of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army, and
the raising of men to keep the Country from
coming in to the King. The King began his
march from <hi>Sterling</hi> the last of <hi>July,</hi> and <hi>Aug.</hi> 22.
came to <hi>Worcester,</hi> by the way of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> with a

followed, and joining with the new Levies, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
<hi>Worcester</hi> with 40000, and on the third

morning got into <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> 25 Miles from

afterwards went up and down in great danger
of being discovered, till at last he got over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>Lieutenant Gen. <hi>Monk</hi> whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> left
there with 7000 took <hi>Sterling, August</hi> the 14th,

by Storm, because it resisted; this the Souldiers
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103390:123"/>
plundered, and had good booty, because the <hi>Scots</hi>
for safety had sent thither their most precious
Goods from <hi>Edinburrough</hi> and St. <hi>Johnston</hi>'s; he
took likewise by surrender <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and the
place where the Scotish Ministers first learn'd
to play the Fools, St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> Also in the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
Colonel <hi>Alured</hi> took a knot of Lords and
Gentlemen, <hi>viz.</hi> four Earls, and four Lords,

whom he sent Prisoners into <hi>England,</hi> so that
there was nothing more to be fear'd from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
all the trouble of the <hi>Rump</hi> was to resolve
what they should do with it, at last they resolv'd
to Unite and Incorporate it into a Common-wealth
with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to that
end sent thither <hi>St. Johns, Vane,</hi> and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
to offer them this Union by publique
Declaration, and to warn them to chuse their
Deputies of Shires, and Burgesses of Towns, and
send them to <hi>Westminster.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think so; and yet it was by many of the
<hi>Scots,</hi> especially by the Ministers and other <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
refused: the Ministers had given way
to the Levying of Mony for the payment of the
<hi>English</hi> Souldiers, but to comply with the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>English</hi> Commissioners they absolutely
forbad.</p>

               <p>Methinks this Contributing to the Pay of
their Conquerors was some mark of Servitude,

               <p>The cause why they refused the Union, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> themselves, was this,
That it drew with it a subordination of the
Church to the Civil State in the things of Christ.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This is a down-right Declaration to all
Kings and Common-wealths in general, that a
Presbyterian Minister will be a true Subject to
none of them in the things of Christ, which
things what they are they will be Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
what then have we gotten by our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the Popes Tyranny, if these pretty
Men succeed in the place of it, that have nothing
in them that can be beneficial to the Publique,
except their silence? for their Learning, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to no more than an imperfect knowledge
of Greek and Latin, and acquired readiness in
the Scripture Language, with a Gesture and
Tone suitable thereunto: but of Justice and
Charity (the Manners of Religion) they have
neither Knowledge nor Practice, as is manifest
by the Stories I have already told you: nor do
they distinguish between the Godly and Ungodly,
but by Conformity of Design in Men of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
or by Repetition of their Sermons in the
Common sort of People.</p>

               <p>But this fullenness of the <hi>Scots</hi> was to no

of the two Nations, and the Abolition of

               <p>They sent St. <hi>Johns</hi> and <hi>Strickland</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to offer League to the
<hi>United Provinces,</hi> who had Audience <hi>March</hi> the
third: St. <hi>Johns</hi> in a Speech shewed those States
what advantage they might have by this League,
in their Trade and Navigations, by the use of
the English Ports and Harbors; the <hi>Dutch,</hi> though
they shewed no great forwardness in the business,
yet appointed Commissioners to Treat with them
about it, but the People were generally against it,
calling the Ambassadors and their Followers (as
they were) Traytors and Murderers, and made
such Tumults about their House, that their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
durst not go abroad till the States had
quieted them: the <hi>Rump</hi> advertis'd hereof, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
recall'd them; the Complement which St.
<hi>Johns</hi> gave to the Commissioners, at their taking
leave, is worth your hearing; You have (said he)
an Eye upon the Event of the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and therefore do refuse the Friendship we have
offered now. I can assure you many in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
were of Opinion that we should not have
sent any Ambassadors to you, till we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
your Ambassadors to us: I now perceive
our Error, and that those Gentlemen were in
the right: In a short time you shall see that Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
ended, when it shall perplex you that you
have refus'd our Proffer.</p>

               <p>S. <hi>Johns</hi> was not sure that the <hi>Scotish</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
would end as it did; for though the <hi>Scots</hi>
were beaten at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> he could not be sure of
the Event of their entering of <hi>England,</hi> which

               <p>But he guess'd well; for within a Month
after the Battel at <hi>Worcester,</hi> an Act passed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
the importing of Merchandize in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>English</hi> Ships: The <hi>English</hi> also molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Fishing upon our Coast: They also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times searched their Ships (upon occasion of
our War with <hi>France)</hi> and made some of them
Prize: and then the <hi>Dutch</hi> sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
hither, to desire what they before refus'd;
but partly also to inform themselves what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Forces the <hi>English</hi> had ready, and how the
people were contented with the Government.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Rump shewed now as little desire of
Agreement, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> did then, standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
terms never likely to be granted. First, For
the Fishing on the <hi>English</hi> Coast, that they should
not have it without paying for it. Secondly,
That the <hi>English</hi> should have free Trade from
<hi>Middleburgh</hi> to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as they had before
their Rebellion against the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
They demanded amends for the old (but
never-to-be-forgotten) business of <hi>Amboyna;</hi> so
that the War was already certain, though the
Season kept them from Action till the Spring
following. The true Quarrel on the <hi>English</hi> part
was, that their proffer'd Friendship was scorn'd,
and their Ambassadours affronted: On the
<hi>Dutch</hi> part, was their greediness to Ingross all
Traffick, and a false Estimate of our and their
own Strength. Whilst these things were doing,
the Reliques of the War, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103390:125"/>
                  <hi>Scotland,</hi> were not neglected, though these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were not fully pacified till two years after:
The Persecution of Royalists also still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
among whom was beheaded one M. <hi>Love,</hi>
for holding Correspondence with the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I had thought <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, whilst
they are such, could not be Royalists, because
they think their Assembly have the Supreme
Power in the things of Christ; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
they are in <hi>England</hi> by a Statute Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You may think so still; for though I called
Mr. <hi>Love</hi> a Royalist, I meant it only for that
one act for which he was condemned. It was
he, who, during the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the Commissioners there, said, <hi>It was
as possible for Heaven and Hell, as for the King
and Parliament to agree.</hi> Both he and the rest of
the Presbyterians are and were Enemies to the
Kings Enemies, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Phanaticks, for
their own, not for the Kings sake: Their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
was like that of Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> that kept
the King out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and afterwards would
have betrayed the same to the Marquess of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle.</hi>
These Presbyterians therefore cannot
be rightly called Loyal, but rather doubly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious;
unless you think that as two Negatives
make an Affirmative, so two Treasons make
Loyalty.</p>
               <p>This Year also were reduced to the obedience
of the Rump, the Islands of <hi>Scilly</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and
the <hi>Barbado</hi>'s, and St. <hi>Christophers.</hi> One thing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103390:126"/>
fell out that they liked not, which was that
<hi>Cromwel</hi> gave them warning to determine their
sitting according to the Bill for Triennial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>In the year 1652. <hi>May</hi> 14. began the <hi>Dutch</hi>
War in this manner, three <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War,
with divers Merchants from the <hi>Straights,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discovered by one Captain <hi>Young,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
some <hi>English</hi> Frigats, the said <hi>Young</hi>
sent to their Admiral to bid him strike his Flag
(a thing usually done in acknowledgment of
the <hi>English</hi> Dominion in the Narrow Seas) which
accordingly he did. Then came up the Vice-Admiral,
and being called so as the other was
to take down his Flag, he answered plainly he
would not; but after the exchange of four or
five Broadsides, and mischief done on either
part, he took it down; but Captain <hi>Young</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
also either the Vice-Admiral himself,
or his Ship, to make satisfaction for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
already sustained. To which the Vice-Admiral
answered, that he had taken in his Flag,
but would defend himself and his Ship: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Captain <hi>Young</hi> consulting with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of his other Ships, lest the beginning of
the War in this time of Treaty should be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon himself, and night also coming on,
thought fit to proceed no farther.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The War certainly began at this time;
but who began it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Dominion of the Sea belonging to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103390:126"/>
the <hi>English,</hi> there can be no question but the
<hi>Dutch</hi> began it; and that the said Dominion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the <hi>English,</hi> it was confest at first by
the Admiral himself peaceably, and at last by
the Vice-Admiral, taking in their Flags.</p>
               <p>About a Fortnight after there happened ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fight upon the like occasion, upon <hi>Tromp</hi>
with 42 Men of War, who came back to the
back of <hi>Godwin-Sands</hi> (Major <hi>Bourn</hi> being then
with a few of the Parliament's Ships in the
<hi>Downs,</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> with the rest farther West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
and sent two Captains of his to <hi>Bourn</hi>
to excuse his coming thither: To whom <hi>Bourn</hi>
returned this answer, that the Message was ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
but that it might appear real, he ought to
depart. So <hi>Tromp</hi> departed, meaning (now
<hi>Bourn</hi> was satisfied) to sail towards <hi>Blake,</hi> and
he did so; but so did also <hi>Bourn,</hi> for fear of
the worst: When <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> were near
one another, <hi>Blake</hi> made a shot over <hi>Tromp</hi>'s
Ship, as a warning to him to take in his Flag:
This he did thrice, and then <hi>Tromp</hi> gave him a
Broad-side, and so began the Fight (at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
whereof <hi>Bourn</hi> came in) and lasted
from two a Clock till night, the <hi>English</hi> having
the better, and the Flag as before making the
quarrel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What need is there, when both Nations
were heartily resolved to fight, to stand so
much upon this Complement of who should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin?
For as to the gaining of Friends and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
thereby, I think 'tis in vain; seeing
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103390:127"/>
Princes and States, on such occasions, look not
much upon the Justice of their Neighbours, but
upon their own concernment in the Event.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is commonly so: but in this case the
<hi>Dutch</hi> knowing the Dominion of the Narrow
Seas, to be a gallant Title, and envied by all
the Nations that reach the Shore, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that they were likely to oppose it, did
wisely enough in making this point the state of
the quarrel.</p>
               <p>After this Fight the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassadors resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in <hi>England,</hi> sent a Paper to the Council of
State, wherein they stiled this last Encounter a
rash action, and affirmed it was done without
the knowledge, and against the will of their
Lords, the States General, and desired them
that nothing might be done upon it in heat,
which might become irreparable. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereupon voted, First, That the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
should pay the Charges they were at, and
for the Dammages they sustained upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.
Secondly, That this being paid, there
should be a Cessation of all Acts of Hostility,
and a mutual Restitution of all Ships and Goods
taken. Thirdly, And both these agreed so,
that there should be made a League between the
two Common-wealths. These Votes were sent
to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassadors, in answer of the
said Paper; but with a Preamble setting forth
the former kindnesses of <hi>England</hi> to the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> and taking notice of their new
Fleet of 150 Men of War, without any other
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103390:127"/>
apparent Design than the Destruction of the
English Fleet.</p>

               <p>What answer made the <hi>Dutch</hi> to this?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>None. <hi>Tromp</hi> sailed presently into <hi>Zealand,</hi>
and <hi>Blake</hi> with 70 Men of War to the <hi>Orkney</hi>-Islands,
to seize their Busses, and to wait for five
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships from the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> and Sir <hi>George
Ascue,</hi> newly return'd from the <hi>Barbados,</hi> came
into the <hi>Downs</hi> with fifteen Men of War, where
he was commanded to stay for a Recruit out of
the <hi>Thames. Tromp,</hi> being recruited to 120 Sail,
made account to get in between Sir <hi>George Ascue</hi>
and the Mouth of the River, but was hindred so
long by contrary Winds, that the Merchants cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for his Convoy he could stay no longer, and
so he went back into <hi>Holland,</hi> and thence to <hi>Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
where he met with the said five <hi>East-India</hi>
Ships, and sent them home: and then he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to engage with <hi>Blake;</hi> but a sudden Storm
forced him to Sea, and so dissipated his Fleet, that
only forty two came home in one Body, the rest
singly as well as they could; <hi>Blake</hi> also came
home, but went first to the Coast of <hi>Holland,</hi> with
900 Prisoners and six Men of War taken, which
were part of twelve which he found and took
Guarding their Busses. This was the first Bout
after the War declar'd.</p>
               <p>In <hi>August</hi> following there hapned a Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>De Ruiter</hi> the Admiral of <hi>Zeland,</hi> with
fifty Men of War, and Sir <hi>George Ascue</hi> near
<hi>Plimouth,</hi> with forty; wherein Sir <hi>George</hi> had the
better, and might have got an entire Victory, had
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103390:128"/>
the whole Fleet ingaged. Whatsoever was the
matter, the <hi>Rump</hi> (though they rewarded him)
never more imployed him, after his return, in
their Service at Sea: but Voted for the year
to come three Generals, <hi>Blake</hi> that was one alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Monk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> Besieging
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> sending a Fleet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, General <hi>Blake</hi> lighting on the <hi>French</hi> at
<hi>Calais,</hi> and taking seven of their Ships, was cause
of the Towns Surrender.</p>
               <p>In <hi>September</hi> they fought again, <hi>De Wit</hi> and
<hi>Ruiter</hi> commanding the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> the
<hi>English;</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were again worsted.</p>
               <p>Again, in the end of <hi>November, Van Tromp</hi>
with 80 Men of War shewed himself at the back
of <hi>Godwin-sands,</hi> where <hi>Blake,</hi> though he had
with him but 40, adventur'd to fight with him,
and had much the worst, and (night parting the
Fray) retir'd into the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> whilst
<hi>Van Tromp</hi> keeping the Sea, took some inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Vessels from the <hi>English;</hi> and thereupon,
(as it is said) with a Childish Vanity, hung out a
Broom from his Main Top-Mast, signifying he
meant to sweep the Sea of all English Shipping.</p>
               <p>After this, in <hi>Frebruary,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> with <hi>Van
Tromp,</hi> were encountred by the <hi>English</hi> under
<hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Dean,</hi> near <hi>Ports-mouth,</hi> and had the
worst. And these were all the Encounters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them this year in the narrow Seas: they
fought also once at <hi>Legorn,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi>
had the better.</p>

are usually had) to signifie the Declaration of
the War, and to get them to their Party, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
their Ambassadours from <hi>England,</hi> and the
<hi>Rump</hi> without delay gave them their parting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
without abating a Syllable of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
severe Propositions, and presently to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the War for the next year, laid a Tax upon
the People of 120000 <hi>l. per Mensem.</hi>

               <p>What was done in the mean time at home?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> was now quarrelling (the last and
greatest Obstacle to his Design) the Rump,
and to that end there came out daily from the
Army Petitions, Addresses, Remonstrances, and
other such Papers, some of them urging the
Rump to dissolve themselves, and make way for
another Parliament; to which the Rump unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to yield, and not daring to refuse, determin'd
for the end of their sitting the 5th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1654.</hi> but <hi>Cromwel</hi> meant not to stay so long.
In the mean time the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> was taking
Submissions, and granting Transportations of the
<hi>Irish,</hi> and condemning who they pleased in a
High Court of Justice erected there for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Among these that were executed was
hang'd Sir <hi>Phelim Oncale,</hi> who first began the
Rebellion in <hi>Scotland;</hi> the <hi>English</hi> built some Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103390:129"/>
for the bridling that stubborn Nation:
and thus ended the year, 1652.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> wanted now but one step to the
end of his Ambition, and that was, To set his
Foot upon the Neck of this Long-Parliament,
which he did <hi>April</hi> the <hi>23th</hi> of this present year,
1653. a time very seasonable; for though the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were not master'd, yet they were much
weakened, and what with Prizes from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and squeezing the Royal Party, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
was pretty full, and the Tax of 120000 <hi>l.</hi>
a Month began to come in, all which was his own
in right of the Army: Therefore without any
more ado, attended by the Major Generals,
<hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Harrison,</hi> and some other Officers,
and as many Souldiers as he thought fit, he went
to the Parliament-house and dissolv'd them,
turn'd them out, and lock'd up the Doors; and
for this Action he was more applauded by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than for any of his Victories in the War, and
the Parliament men as much scorn'd and derided.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Now that there was no Parliament, who had
the Supreme Power?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If by Power you mean the right to Govern,
no body had it; if you mean the Supreme
Strength, it was clearly in <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
as General of all the Forces in <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>Did he pretend that for Title?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No, but presently after he intended a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
which was this, That he was necessitated for
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103390:129"/>
the defence of the Cause, for which at first the
Parliament had taken up Arms, (that is to say
Rebell'd) to have recourse to extraordinary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
You know the pretence of the Long-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Rebellion was <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> the safety of
the Nation against a dangerous Conspiracy of
<hi>Papists,</hi> and a Malignant Party at home; and
that every man is bound, as far as his Power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
to procure the safety of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which none but the Army were able to do,
and the Parliament had hitherto neglected) was
it not then the General's Duty to do it? had he
not therefore right? for that Law of <hi>Salus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli</hi>
is directed only to those that have Power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to defend the People; that is, to them that
have the Supreme Power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes certainly, he had as good a Title as the
Long-Parliament, but the Long-Parliament did
represent the People, and it seems to me that
the Soveraign Power is essentially annexed to the
Representative of the People.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, if he that makes a Representative,
that is (in the present case) the King, do call
them together to receive the Soveraign Power,
and he divest himself thereof, otherwise not;
nor was ever the lower House of Parliament the
Representative of the whole Nation, but of the
Commons only; nor had that House the Power
to oblige by their Acts, or Ordinances, any Lord
or any Priest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Did <hi>Cromwel</hi> come in upon the only Title
of <hi>Salus Populi?</hi> For this is a Title very few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:103390:130"/>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>His way was to get the Supreme Power
conferr'd upon him by Parliament; therefore
he call'd Parliament, and gave it the Supreme
Power, to the end that they should give it to him
again; was not this witty: First therefore he
published a Declaration of the Causes why he
dissolv'd the Parliament; the sum whereof was,
That instead of endeavouring to promote the
good of God's people, they endeavour'd (by a
Bill then ready to pass) to recruit the House, and
perpetuate their own Power. Next he constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Council of State of his own Creatures to
be the Supreme Authority of <hi>England,</hi> but no
longer than till the next Parliament should be
call'd and met: Thirdly he summon'd a hundred
forty two Persons, such as he himself or his tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
Officers made choice of, the greatest part of
whom were instructed what to do, obscure Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and most of them Phanaticks, though stil'd
by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> men of approv'd Fidelity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty;
to these the Council of State surrendred
the Supreme Authority; and not long after these
Men surrendred it to <hi>Cromwel. July</hi> the fourth
this Parliament met, and chose for their Speaker
one Mr. <hi>Rous,</hi> and called themselves from that
time forward the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> But
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> for the more surety, constituted also a
Council of State, not of such petty Fellows as
most of these were, but of himself and of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Officers. These did all the business both
publique and private, making Ordinances, and
giving Audience to Foreign Ambassadors. But
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103390:130"/>
he had now more Enemies than before: <hi>Harrison,</hi>
who was the Head of the Fifth-Monarchy-Men,
laying down his Commission, did nothing but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate
his party against him, for which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he was Imprisoned. This little Parliament
in the mean time were making of Acts so ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and displeasing to the People, that it was
thought he chose them on purpose to bring all
Ruling Parliaments into contempt, and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
again into Credit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What Acts were these?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>One of them was, That all Marriages
should be made by a Justice of Peace, and the
Banes asked three several days in the next Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.
None were forbidden to be married by a
Minister, but without a Justice of Peace the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was to be void: so divers wary Couples
(to be sure of one another, howsoever they
might repent it afterwards) were married both
ways: also they Abrogated the Engagement
whereby no man was admitted to sue in any
Court of Law, that had not taken it, that is, that
had not acknowledged the late <hi>Rump.</hi>

               <p>Neither of these did any hurt to <hi>Cromwel.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They were also in Hand with an Act to
Cancel all the present Laws, and Law-Books,
and to make a new Code more suitable to the
Humor of the Fifth-Monarchy-Men, of whom
there were many in this Parliament; their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
being; That there ought none to be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
but King Jesus, nor any to Govern under
him but the Saints; but their Authority ended
before this Act passed.</p>

               <p>What is this to <hi>Cromwel?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing yet; but they were likewise upon
an Act, now almost ready for the Question;
That Parliaments hence forward, one upon the
end of another, should be Perpetual.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I understand not this, unless Parliaments

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why not like the <hi>Phoenix?</hi> Cannot a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at the day of their Expiration send out
Writs for a new one?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think they would not rather Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
themselves anew, and, to save the labour
of coming again to <hi>Westminster,</hi> sit still where
they were? or if they summon the Counties to
make new Elections, and then Dissolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by what Authority shall the People meet
in their County-Courts, there being no Supreme
Authority standing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>All they did was absurd: though they knew
not that, no nor this, whose Design was upon the
Soveraignty; the Contrivers of this Act it seems
perceiv'd not, but <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Party in the House
saw it well enough: and therefore as soon as
it was laid, there stood up one of the Members
and made a Motion, that since the Common-Wealth
was like to receive little benefit by their
Sitting, they should Dissolve themselves. <hi>Harrison</hi>
and they of his Sect was troubled hereat, and
made Speeches against it: but <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s party, of
whom the Speaker was one, left the House, and
with the Mace before them went to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:103390:131"/>
and surrendred their Power to <hi>Cromwel</hi> that had
given it them; and so he got the Soveraignty
by an Act of Parliament: and within four days
after, <hi>(viz.) December</hi> 16th. was Installed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
and took his Oath to observe certain
Rules of Governing engrossed in Parchment, and
read before him, the writing was called, The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What were the Rules he sware to?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>One was to call a Parliament every third
year, of which the first was to begin <hi>September</hi>
the third following.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I believe he was a little Superstitious in the
Choice, <hi>September</hi> the third, because it was lucky
in 1650 and 1651 at <hi>Dunbar</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> but
he knew not how lucky the same would be to
the whole Nation, in 1658. at <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Another was; That no Parliament should
be Dissolv'd till it had sitten five Moneths, and
those Bills that they then presented to him
should be passed within twenty days by him, or
else they should pass without him.</p>
               <p>A third, That he should have a Council of
State of not above twenty one, nor under thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
and that upon the Protectors Death this
Council should meet, and before they parted
chuse a new Protector. There were many
more besides, but not necessary to be inserted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How went on the War against the <hi>Dutch?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Generals for the <hi>English</hi> were <hi>Blake,</hi>
and <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Monk;</hi> and <hi>Van Tromp</hi> for the
<hi>Dutch;</hi> between whom was a Battel fought the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103390:132"/>
second of <hi>June</hi> (which was a Month before the
beginning of this little Parliament) wherein
the <hi>English</hi> had the Victory, and drove the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
into their Harbours, but with the loss of
General <hi>Dean,</hi> slain by a Cannon-shot. This
Victory was great enough to make the <hi>Dutch</hi>
send over Ambassadors into <hi>England</hi> in order to
a Treaty. But in the mean time they prepared
and put to Sea another Fleet, which likewise in
the end of <hi>July</hi> was defeated by General <hi>Monk,</hi>
who got now a greater Victory than before:
And this made the <hi>Dutch</hi> descend so far, as to
buy their Peace with the payment of the Charge
of the War, and with the acknowledgment, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other Articles, that the <hi>English</hi> had the
right of the Flag. This Peace was concluded in
<hi>March,</hi> being the end of this year, but not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
till <hi>April;</hi> the Money it seems being
not paid till then.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> War being now ended, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
sent his youngest Son, <hi>Henry,</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
whom also some time after he made Lieutenant
there; and sent <hi>Monk</hi> Lieutenant General into
<hi>Scotland;</hi> to keep those Nations in Obedience.
Nothing else worth remembring was done this
year at home, saving the discovery of a Plot of
Royalists (as was said) upon the life of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
who all this while had intelligence of
the Kings Designs from a Traytor in his Court,
who afterwards was taken in the manner, and
kill'd.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How came he into so much trust with the
King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He was the Son of a Colonel that was
slain in the Wars on the late King's side: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
he pretended Employment from the Kings
loyal and loving Subjects here, to convey to his
Majesty Money, as they from time to time should
send him: And to make this credible, <hi>Cromwel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
caused Money to be sent to him. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
year 1654. had nothing of War, but
was spent in Civil Ordinances, in appointing
of Judges, preventing of Plots (for Usurpers
are jealous) and in executing of the Kings
Friends, and selling their Lands. The third
of <hi>September,</hi> according to the Instrument, the
Parliament met; in which there was no House
of Lords, and the House of Commons was made
as formerly of Knights and Burgesses, but not
as formerly two Burgesses of a Burrough, and
two Knights for a County; for Burroughs for
the most part had but one Burgess, and some
Counties six or seven Knights; besides there
were twenty Members for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for <hi>Ireland:</hi> So that now <hi>Cromwell</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do, but to shew his Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon six Coach-Horses newly presented
him, which being as rebellious as himself, threw
him out of the Coach-box, and had almost
kill'd him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This Parliament which had seen how <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
handled the two former, the long and the
short one, had surely learnt the wit to behave
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103390:133"/>
themselves better to him than those had done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, especially now that <hi>Cromwel</hi> in his
Speech at their first meeting, had expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
them to meddle with the Government
of a single Person and Parliament, or with
the Militia, or with perpetuating of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or taking away Liberty of Conscience.
And he told them also, that every Member of
the House, before they sate, must take a Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of his Power in divers points; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
of above 400 there appear'd not above
200 at first; though afterwards some relenting,
there sate about 300 again: Just at their sitting
down, he published some Ordinances of his own,
bearing date before their meeting, that they
might see he took his own Acts to be as valid
as theirs. But all this could not make them
know themselves, for they proceeded to the
debate of every Article of the Recognition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>They should have debated that before
they had taken it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But then they had never been suffered to
sit: <hi>Cromwell,</hi> being informed of their stubborn
proceedings, and out of hope of any Supply
from them, dissolv'd them.</p>
               <p>All that passed besides in this year, was the
Excise of the High-Court of Justice upon some
Royalists for Plots.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1655. the <hi>English,</hi> to the number
of near 10000, landed in <hi>Hispaniola</hi> in hope of
the plunder of the Gold and Silver, whereof
they thought there was great abundance in the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103390:133"/>
Town of <hi>Santo Domingo;</hi> but were well beaten
by a few <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and with the loss of near
1000 Men, went off to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and possessed it.</p>
               <p>This year also the Royal Party made another
Attempt in the <hi>West,</hi> and proclaimed there King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second; but few joining with them, and
some falling off, they were soon suppressed, and
many of the Principal Persons Executed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In these many Insurrections, the Royalists,
tho they meant well, yet they did but dis-service
to the King by their impatience. What hope had
they to prevail against so great an Army as the
Protector had ready? What cause was there to
despair of seeing the King's business better done
by the Dissention and Ambition of the great
Commmanders in that Army, whereof many
had the favour to be esteem'd among them as
well as <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself?</p>

               <p>That was somewhat incertain: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
being frustrated of his hope of Money
at <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> resolv'd to take from the
Royalists the 10th part yearly of their Estates:
And to this end chiefly, he divided <hi>England</hi> into
eleven Major-General-Ships, with Commission
to every Major-General to make a Roll of the
Names of all suspected persons of the King's
party, and to receive the 10th part of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
within his Precinct: As also to take cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from them not to act against the State, and
to reveal all Plots that should come to their
knowledge, and to make them engage the like
for their Servants: They had Commission also to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103390:134"/>
forbid Horse-races, and concourse of people,
and to receive and account for this Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>By this the Usurper might easily inform
himself of the value of all the Estates in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and of the Behaviour and Affection of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The year 1656 was a Parliament-year, by
the instrument; between the beginning of this
year, and the day of the Parliaments sitting,
these Major-Generals resided in several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
behaving themselves most Tyrannically.</p>
               <p>Amongst other of their Tyrannies was the
awing of Elections, and making themselves,
and whom they pleas'd, to be return'd Members
for the Parliament, which was also thought a part
of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Design in their Constitution; for he
had need of a giving Parliament, having lately
upon a Peace made with the <hi>French,</hi> drawn upon
himself a War with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This year it was that Captain <hi>Stainer</hi> set upon
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Plate-fleet, being 8 in number, near
<hi>Cadiz,</hi> whereof he sunk two and took two, there
being in one of them two millions of pieces of 8,
which amounts to 400000 <hi>l.</hi> sterling.</p>
               <p>This year also it was that <hi>James Naylor</hi> appear'd
at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and would be taken for <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi>
he wore his Beard forked, and his Hair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the likeness of that in the <hi>Volto Santo;</hi>
and being questioned, would sometimes answer,
<hi>Thou sayest it.</hi> He had also his Disciples that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103390:134"/>
would go by his Horse side to the mid-leg in
dirt. Being sent for by the Parliament, he was
Sentenced to stand on the Pillory, to have his
Tongue bored through, and to be marked in
the Fore-head with the Letter B for Blasphemy,
and to remain in <hi>Bridewell. Lambert,</hi> a great
Favourite of the Army, endeavour'd to save
him, partly because he had been his Souldier,
and partly to carry favour with the Sectaries of
the Army; for he was now no more in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's
Favour, but meditating how he might
succeed him in his Power.</p>
               <p>About two years before this there appear'd
in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time a Prophetess much fam'd for her
Dreams and Visions, and hearkened to by many,
whereof some were Eminent Officers, but she
and some of her Complices being imprison'd, we
heard no more of her.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard of another, one <hi>Lilly,</hi> that
Prophesied all the time of the Long-Parliament,
what did they to him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>His Prophesies were of another kind;
he was a Writer of Almanacks, and a Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a pretended Art of Judicial Astrologie,
a meer Cozener to get Maintenance from a
Multitude of ignorant people, and no doubt
had been call'd in question, if his Prophesies had
been any wayes disadvantageous to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  </gap> (for such I take

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103390:135"/>
can be of any great disadvantage to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes: know there is nothing that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Humane Councils difficult, but the incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of future time, nor that so well directs men
in their deliberations, as the fore-sight of the
sequels of their Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prophesie, being
many times the Principal Cause of the Event
foretold. If upon some prediction the people
should have been made to believe confidently,
That <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and his Army should be upon
a day to come utterly defeated, would not every
one have endeavour'd to assist, and to deserve
well of the Party that should give him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat:
upon this account it was that Fortune-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Astrologers were so often banished out
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last memorable thing of this year was a
Motion made by a Member of the House, an
Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> That the Protector might
be petitioned and advised by the House to leave
the Title of Protector, and take upon him that
of King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That was indeed a bold Motion, and which
would, if prosperous, have put an end to many
mens Ambition, and to the licentiousness of the
whole Army. I think the Motion was made on
purpose to ruine both the Protector himself,
and his ambitious Officers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It may be so. In the year 1657, the first
thing the Parliament did was the drawing up his
Petition to the Protector, to take upon him
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103390:135"/>
the Title or King; as of other Parliaments, so
of this, the greatest part had been kept out of
the House by force, or else themselves had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
to sit, and became guilty of setting up this
King <hi>Oliver,</hi> but those few that sate presented
their Petition to the Protector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> the 9th, in the Banquetting house at
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington,</hi> the
Speaker, used the first Arguments, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
desired some time to seek God, the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
being weighty: The next day they sent a
Committee to him to receive his answer, which
answer being not very clear, they pressed him
again for a resolution, to which he made answer
in a long Speech that ended in a peremptory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal,
and so retaining still the Title of Protector,
he took upon him the Government according to
certain Articles contained in the said Petition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What made him refuse the Title of King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Because he durst not take it at that time,
the Army being addicted to their great Officers,
and among their great Officers many hoping to
succeed him, and the Succession having been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> would have
mutinied against him, he was therefore forced
to stay for a more propitious Conjuncture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What were those Articles?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The most important of them were, first,
That he would exercise the Office of chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> under
the Title of Protector, and govern the same
according to the said Petition and advice; and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103390:136"/>
that he would in his life time name his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I believe the <hi>Scots,</hi> when they first Rebell'd,
never thought of being Governed absolutely as
they were by <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Secondly, That he should call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
every three years at farthest. Thirdly,
That those persons which were legally chosen
Members should not be secluded without consent
of the House. In allowing this Clause, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
observed not that the secluded Members
of this same Parliament are thereby re-admitted.
Fourthly, The Members were qualified. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Power of the other House was defin'd.
Sixthly, That no Law should be made but by
Act of Parliament. Seventhly, That a constant
yearly Revenue of a Million of pounds should
be setled for the maintenance of the Army and
Navy, and 300000 <hi>l.</hi> for the support of the
Government; besides other Temporary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
as the House of Commons should think
sit. Eighthly, That all the Officers of State
should be chosen by the Parliament. Ninthly,
That the Protector should encourage the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
Lastly, That he should cause a profession
of Religion to be agreed on and published.
There are divers others of less importance.
Having signed the Articles, he was presently with
great Ceremonies installed a-new.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What needed that, seeing he was still but
Protector?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:103390:136"/>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But the Articles of this Petition were not
all the same with those of his former Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for now there was to be another House;
and whereas before his Council was to name his
Successors, he had Power now to do it himself;
so that he was an absolute Monarch, and might
leave the Succession to his Son, if he would;
and so successively, or transfer it to whom he
pleas'd. The Ceremony being ended, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
adjourn'd to the 20th of <hi>January</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and then the other House also sate with
their Fellows.</p>
               <p>The House of Commons being now full, took
little notice of the other House, wherein there
were not of 60 persons above nine Lords, but
fell a questioning all that their Fellows had done
during the time of their Seclusion; whence had
follow'd the avoidance of the Power newly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Protector. Therefore going to the
house, he made a Speech to them, ending in these
words, <hi>By the living God I must and do dissolve
you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this year the <hi>English</hi> gave the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great Blow at <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> not much less than
that they had given him the year before at
<hi>Cadiz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the time of the dissolution of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
the Royalists had another Design against
the Protector, which was to make an Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in <hi>England,</hi> the King being then in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
ready to second them from thence with an
Army: But this also was discover'd by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103390:137"/>
and came to nothing, but the ruine of
those that were ingaged in it, whereof many in
the beginning of the next year were by a High
Court of Justice imprison'd, and some executed.
This year also was Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> put
out of all employment, a Man second to none but
<hi>Oliver</hi> in the favour of the Army: but because
he expected by that favour, or by promise from
the Protector to be his Successor in the Supreme
Power, it would have been dangerous to let
him have Command in the Army, the Protector
having design'd his Successor his Eldest Son <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1658. <hi>September</hi> the third, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
died at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> having ever since his
last Establishment been perplexed with fear of
being kill'd by some desperate attempts of the
Royalists.</p>
               <p>Being importun'd in his sickness by his Privy
Council to name his Successor, he nam'd his Son
<hi>Richard;</hi> who incouraged thereunto, not by his
own Ambition, but by <hi>Fleetwood, Desborough,
Thurloe,</hi> and other of his Council, was content
to take it upon him; and presently Addresses
were made to him from the Armies, in <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> His first business was, the
chargeable and splendid Funeral of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> seated in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Throne of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
Successor to his Father, lifted up to it by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Army then in Town, and congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103390:137"/>
by all the parts of the Army throughout the
three Nations, scarce any Garrison omitting
their particular flattering Addresses to him.</p>

               <p>Seeing the Army approv'd of him, how

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Army was inconstant, he himself irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and without any Millitary Glory; and
though the two principal Officers had a near
relation to him, yet neither of them, but <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
was the great Fovorite of the Army, and by
courting <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to take upon him the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorship,
and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ampering with the Souldiers,
had gotten again to be a Colonel; he and the rest
of the Officers had a Council at <hi>Wallingfod House</hi>
(where <hi>Fleetwood</hi> dwelt) for the dispossessing of
<hi>Richard,</hi> though they had not yet considered
how the Nations should be govern'd afterwards.
For from the beginning of Rebellion the method
of Ambition was constantly this, first to destroy,
and then to consider what they should set up.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Could not the Protector, who kept his
Court at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> discover what the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Officers was at <hi>Wallingford House,</hi> so
near him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: He was by divers of his Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of it, and counsell'd by some of them,
who would have done it, to kill the chief of
them, but he had not courage enough to give
them such a Commission: he took therefore the
counsel of some milder persons, which was to
call a Parliament, whereupon Writs were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent out to those that were in the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103390:138"/>
of the other House, and other Writs to
the Sheriffs for the Election of Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
to Assemble on the twenty seventh of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
following. Elections were made according
to the antient manner, and a House of Commons
now of the right English Temper, and about four
hundred in number, including twenty for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as many for <hi>Ireland;</hi> being met, they take
themselves, without the Protector and other
House, to be a Parliament; and to have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power of the three Nations. For the first
business they intended the Power of that other
House; but because the Protector had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them for their first Business an Act
(already drawn up) for the Recognition of his
Protectoral Power, they began with that, and
Voted (after a fortnights deliberation) that an
Act should be made, whereof this Act of Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
should be part, and that another part
should be for the bounding of the Protectors
Power, and for the securing the Priviledges of
Parliament and Liberties of the Subject, and
that all should pass together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why did these Men own the Protector at
first in meeting upon his only Summons; was not
that as full a Recognition of his Power as
was needful? why, by this example, did they
teach the People that he was to be obeyed, and
then by putting Laws upon him teach them that
he was not? was it not the Protector that made
the Parliament? why did they not acknowledge
their Maker?</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I believe it is the desire of most men to
bear Rule, but few of them know what title one
has to it more than another, besides the right of
the Sword.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If they acknowledged the right of the Sword,
they were neither just nor wise to oppose the
present Government, set up and approved by
all the Forces of the three Kingdoms. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of this House of Commons were no doubt
the very same with theirs, who began the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and would (if they could have raised a
sufficient Army) have done the same against the
Protector: and the General of their Army would
in like manner have reduced them to a <hi>Rump;</hi>
for they that keep an Army and cannot master
it, must be subject to it, as much as he that keeps
a Lion in his house. The temper of all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
since the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> have
been the same with the temper of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and shall always be such as long as the
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and Men of Democratical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have the like influence upon Elections.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>After they resolv'd concerning the other
House, That during this Parliament they would
transact with it, but without intrenching upon the
Right of the Peers to have Writs sent to them
in all future Parliaments. These Votes being pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
they proceed to another, wherein they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to themselves the power of the Militia;
also to shew their Supreme Power, they deliver'd
out of Prison some of those that had been (they
said) illegally committed by the former Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103390:139"/>
Other points concerning Civil Rights, and
concerning Religion, very pleasing to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were now also under consideration; so that
in the end of this year the Protector was no less
jealous of the Parliament than of the Council of
Officers at <hi>Wallingford House.</hi>

               <p>Thus 'tis when ignorant men will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
Reformation: There are three Parties, the

Parliament against the Army, and Protector; and
the Army against the Protector and Parliament.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In the beginning of 1659. the Parliament
passed divers other Acts, one was to forbid the
Meetings in Council of the Army Officers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Order from the Protector and both Houses.
Another that no man shall have any Command
or Trust in the Army, who did not first under
his Hand engage himself never to interrupt any
of the Members, but that they might freely
Meet and Debate in the House. And to please
the Souldiers, they Voted to take presently into
their consideration the means of paying them
their Arrears: But whilst they were considering
this, the Protector (according to the first of those
Acts) forbad the meeting of Officers at <hi>Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-House.</hi>
This made the Government, which
by the disagreement of the Protector and Army,
was already loose, to fall in pieces. For the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
from <hi>Wallingford-House,</hi> with Souldiers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
came to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and brought with
them a Commission ready drawn (giving power
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103390:139"/>
to <hi>Desborough</hi> to Dissolve the Parliament) for
the Protector to sign; which also, his heart and

nevertheless continued sitting; but at the end
of the week the House Adjourned, till the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
after, being <hi>April</hi> the twenty fifth. At their
coming on <hi>Monday</hi> morning they found the Door
shut up, and the passages to the House fill'd with
Souldiers, who plainly told them they must sit no
longer. <hi>Richard</hi>'s Authority and business in Town
being thus at an end, he retir'd into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where within a few days (upon promise of
the payment of his Debts, which his Fathers Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
had made great) he signed a Resignation
of his Protectorship.</p>

and with <hi>Lambert, Heslerig,</hi> and other Officers,
who were also <hi>Rumpers,</hi> in all forty two, to go
into the House, which they did, and were by the
Army declar'd to be the Parliament. There were

private business some few of those whom the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Members. These knowing themselves to
have been Elected by the same Authority, and
having the same Right to fit, attempted to get
into the House, but were kept out by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
The first Vote of the <hi>Rump,</hi> reseated, was,

Parliament have not sitten since the year 1648.

               <p>First from 1640 to 1648. when the King
was murthered, the Soveraignty was disputed
between King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Parliament: Secondly, From 1648. to
1653. The Power was in that part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which voted the Tryel of the King, and
declar'd themselves, without King or House of
Lords, to have the Supreme Authority of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi> For there were in the Long-Parliament
two Factions, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents.</hi>
The former whereof sought only
subjection of the King, nor his destruction direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the latter sought his destruction: and this
part is it which was called the <hi>Rump.</hi> Thirdly,
From <hi>April</hi> the twentieth to <hi>July</hi> the fourth, the
Supreme Power was in the Hands of a Council
of State constituted by <hi>Cromwel.</hi> Fourthly, From
<hi>July</hi> the fourth to <hi>December</hi> the twelfth of the
same year it was in the Hands of Men called unto
it by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> whom he termed men of Fidelity
and Integrity, and made them a Parliament,
which was called in contempt one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103390:140"/>

the twelfth 1653 to <hi>September</hi> the third
1658. it was in the hands of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> with
the Title of Protector. Sixthly, From <hi>September
1658</hi> to <hi>April</hi> the twenty fifth 1659. <hi>Richard
Cromwel</hi> had it as Successor to his Father. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,
From <hi>April</hi> the twenty fifth 1659 to

               <p>One would think them safe enough, the

had helped <hi>Oliver</hi> to pull down the <hi>Rump,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
now, beg'd pardon, and promis'd Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
The Souldiers in Town had their pay
mended; and the Commanders every where took
the old Engagement, whereby they had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
their Authority heretofore; they also
received their Commissions in the House it self
from the Speaker, who was Generalissimo, <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
was made Lieutenant-General, with such
and so many limitations as were thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by the <hi>Rump,</hi> that remembred how they had
been serv'd by their General <hi>Oliver:</hi> Also <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Cromwel,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> having
resign'd his Commission by Command, return'd
into <hi>England.</hi>

But <hi>Lambert,</hi> to whom (as was said) <hi>Oliver</hi> had
promis'd the succession, and as well as the <hi>Rump</hi>
knew the way to the Protectorship by <hi>Olivers</hi>
own foot-steps, was resolv'd to proceed in it
upon the first opportunity, which presented it
self presently after.</p>
               <p>Besides some Plots of Royalists, whom after the
old fashion they again persecuted, there was an
Insurrection made against them by Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> headed by Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> one
of the secluded Members, they were in number
about three thousand, and their pretence was for
a Free-Parliament: There was a great talk of
another Rising or endeavour to Rise in <hi>Devonshire</hi>
and <hi>Cornwal</hi> at the same time: To suppress Sir
<hi>George Booth,</hi> the <hi>Rump</hi> sent down more then a
sufficient Army under <hi>Lambert,</hi> which quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
the <hi>Cheshire</hi> party, and recover'd <hi>Chester,
Leverpool,</hi> and all the other places they had
seized; divers of their Commanders in and after
the Battel were taken Prisoners, whereof Sir
<hi>George Booth</hi> himself was one.</p>
               <p>This exploit done, <hi>Lambert,</hi> before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
caressed his Souldiers with an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at his own House in <hi>York-shire,</hi> and got
their consent to a Petition to be made to the
House; that a General might be set up in the
Army; as being unfit that the Army should be
judged by any Power extrinsick to it self.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Nor I. But it was (as I have heard) an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s: But it so much displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103390:141"/>
the Rump, that they Voted; that the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of more General's in the Army, than were

and dangerous to the Common-Wealth.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This was not <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Method: for though
this <hi>Cheshire</hi> Victory had been as glorious as that
of <hi>Oliver</hi> at <hi>Dunbar;</hi> yet it was not the Victory
that made <hi>Oliver</hi> General, but the Resignation of

Parliament.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>

to expect it; therefore at his return to <hi>London,</hi>
he and other Officers assembling at <hi>Wallingford-house,</hi>
drew their Petition into form, and called
it a Representation, wherein the Chief point
was to have a General; with many other of less
Importance that were added; and this they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to the House <hi>Octob.</hi> the 4th. by Major
General <hi>Desborough:</hi> And this so far forth awed
them, as to reach them so much good manners,
as to promise to take it presently into Debate,
which they did; and <hi>Octob.</hi> the 12th having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
their Spirits, Voted, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of <hi>Lambert, Desborough,</hi> and others of
the Council at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-house, should be
void. <hi>Item,</hi> That the Army should be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Commission to <hi>Fleet-wood, Monk, Hesle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig,
Walton, Morley,</hi> and <hi>Overton,</hi> till <hi>February</hi>
the 12th following; and to make this good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Force they expected from <hi>Lambert,</hi>
they ordered <hi>Heslerig</hi> and <hi>Morley</hi> to issue War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
to such Officers as they could trust to bring
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103390:142"/>
their Souldiers next Morning into <hi>VVestminster,</hi>
which was done somewhat too late, for <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
had first brought his Souldiers thither, and
beset the house, and turn'd back the Speaker
which was then coming to it; but <hi>Heslerig</hi>'s
Forces, marching about St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park wall,
came into St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Church-yard, and so
both Parties looked all day one upon another
like Enemies, but offered not to fight; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Rump was put out of possession of the
House, and the Officers continued their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as before, at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-house; there
they chose from among themselves, with some
few of the City, a Committee, which they called,
<hi>The Committee of safety,</hi> whereof the chief were
<hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Vane;</hi> who, with the advice of a
General Council of Officers, had Power to call
Delinquents to Tryal; to suppress Rebellions;
to treat with Foreign States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You see now
the Rump cut off, and the Supreme Power, (which
is charged with <hi>Salus Populi)</hi> transferred to a
Council of Officers, and yet <hi>Lambert</hi> hopes for
it in the end: But one of their Limitations was,
That they should within six Weeks present to
the Army a new Model of the Government; if
they had done so, do you think they would have
preferr'd <hi>Lambert,</hi> or any other, to the Supreme
Authority rather than themselves?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think not: when the Rump had put
into Commission (among a few others) for the
Government of the Army, that is, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the three Nations, General <hi>Monk,</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:103390:142"/>
already Commander in chief of the Army in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and that had done much greater things
in this War than <hi>Lambert,</hi> how durst they leave
him out of this Committee of safety? or how
could <hi>Lambert</hi> think that Gen. <hi>Monk</hi> would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
it and not endeavor to fasten the <hi>Rump</hi> again.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>They thought not of him, his Gallantry

<hi>Scotland;</hi> his Ambition had not appeared here
in their Contentions for the Government, but
he had complyed both with <hi>Richard</hi> and the
<hi>Rump.</hi> After General <hi>Monk</hi> had signified by
Letter his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>slike of the Proceedings of <hi>Lambert</hi>
and his Fellows, they were much surpris'd, and
began to think him more considerable than they
had done, but it was too late.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why, was his Army not too small for so
great an Enterprize?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The General knew very well his own and
their Forces, both what they were then, and
how they were to be augmented, and what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
City and Country wished for, which was
the Restitution of the King; which to bring
about, there needed no more but to come with
his Army (though not very great) to <hi>London,</hi>
to the doing whereof there was no obstacle but
the Army with <hi>Lambert.</hi> What could he do in
this Case? If he had declar'd presently for the
King, or for a free Parliament, all the Armies
in <hi>England</hi> would have joyned against him, and,
assuming the Title of a Parliament, would have
furnished themselves with Money. General
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103390:143"/>
                  <hi>Monk,</hi> after he had thus quarrelled by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the Council of Officers, he secur'd first
those Officers of his own Army which were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists,</hi>
and therefore not to be trusted, and
put others into their places; then drawing his
Forces together, march'd to <hi>Berwick.</hi> Being
there he indicted a Convention of the <hi>Scots,</hi> of
whom he desired, That they would take order
for the security of the Nation in his absence, and
raise some maintenance for his Army in their
March. The Convention promised, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Nation, their best endeavour, and
rais'd him a sum of Money, not great, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for his purpose, excusing themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their present wants. On the other side, the
Committee of Safety, with the greatest and best
part of their Army, sent <hi>Lambert</hi> to oppose
him; but at the same time, by divers Messages
and Mediators, urged him to a Treaty, which
he consented to, and sent three Officers to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to treat with as many of theirs. These six
suddenly concluded, without power from the
General, upon these Articles; That the King be
excluded, a Free State setled, the Ministry and
Universities incouraged, with divers which the
General liked not, and imprison'd one of his
Commissioners for exceeding his Commission;
whereupon another Treaty was agreed on, of
five to five: but whilst these Treaties were in
hand, <hi>Haslerig,</hi> a Member of the Rump, seized
on <hi>Portsmouth;</hi> and the Souldiers sent by the
Committee of Safety to reduce it, instead of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103390:143"/>
that entred into the Town, and joyned with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slerig.</hi>
Secondly, The City renewed their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
for a Free Parliament. Thirdly, The
Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> a Member also of the Rump,
and greatly favour'd in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> was raising
Forces there behind <hi>Lambert;</hi> who being now
between two Armies, his Enemies, would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have fought the General. Fourthly, there
came news that <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornwal</hi> were
listing of Souldiers. Lastly, <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army
wanting Money, and sure they should not be
furnished from the Council of Officers, which
had neither Authority nor Strength to levy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
grew discontented, and for their Free-Quarter
were odious to the Northern Countries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder why the <hi>Scots</hi> were so ready to
furnish General <hi>Monk</hi> with Money, for they
were no Friends to the Rump.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I know not; but I believe the <hi>Scots</hi> would
have parted with a greater sum, rather than the
<hi>English</hi> should not have gone together by the
Ears among themselves. The Council of Officers
being now beset with so many Enemies, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
speedily their Model of Government, which
was to have a free Parliament, which should meet
<hi>December</hi> the fifteenth, but with such Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of no King, no House of Lords, as made
the City more angry than before. To send Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
into the <hi>West,</hi> to suppress those that were
rising there, they durst not, for fear of the City;
nor could they raise any other, for want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
there remain'd nothing but to break, and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103390:144"/>
quitting <hi>Wallingford-House,</hi> to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
This coming to the knowledge of their
Army in the <hi>North,</hi> they deserted <hi>Lambert;</hi> and
the Rumpers the 26th of <hi>December</hi> re-possessed
the House.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing the Rump was now re-seated, the

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Rump, though seated, was not well
setled; but (in the midst of so many Tumults
for a free Parliament) had as much need of the
General's coming up now, as before: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent them word, that because he thought
them not yet secure enough, he would come up
to <hi>London</hi> with his Army; which they not only
accepted of, but entreated him so to do, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him for his service 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a year.</p>
               <p>The General marching towards <hi>London,</hi> the
Country every where Petition'd him for a free
Parliament. The Rump to make room in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
for his Army, dislodged their own; the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for all that, had not let fall a word in all
this time, that could be taken for a Declaration
of his Final Design.</p>

               <p>How did the Rump revenge themselves on

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They never troubled him: nor do I know
any cause of their so gentle dealing with him;
but certainly <hi>Lambert</hi> was the ablest of any Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
they had to do them service, when they
should have means and need to imploy him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the General was come to <hi>London,</hi> the Rump
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103390:144"/>
sent to the City for their part of a Tax of
100000 <hi>l.</hi> a Month for six Months, according to
an Act which the Rump had made formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Disseism by the Committee of Safety:
But the City, who were averse to the Rump, and
keen upon a free Parliament, could not be
brought to give their Money to their Enemies,
and to purposes repugnant to their own; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Rump sent Order to the General to
break down the City Gates, and their Portculli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and to imprison certain obstinate Citizens:
This he perform'd, and it was the last service
he did them.</p>
               <p>About this time the Commission by which Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Monk</hi> with others had the Government of
the Army put into their hands by the Rump, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Usurpation of the Council of Officers,
came to expire, which the present Rump renewed.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>He was thereby the sixth part of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the whole Forces of the Common-wealth;
if I had been as the Rump, he should
have been sole General. In such cases as this,
there cannot be a greater Vice than pinching:
Ambition should be liberal.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>After the pulling down of the City Gates,
the General sent a Letter to the Rump, to let
them know that this service was much against his
Nature; and to put them in mind, how well the
City had serv'd the Parliament in the whole
War.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; but for the City the Parliament could

have murdered the King.</p>

               <p>The Rump considered not the Merit of the
City, nor the good nature of the General, they
were busie, they were giving out Commissions,
making of Acts for Abjuration of the King and
his Line, and for the Old Engagement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with the City to get Money. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
also desir'd to hear Conference between
some of the Rump, and some of the secluded
Members, concerning the Justice of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
and of the hurt that could follow upon
their re-admission, and it was granted. After
long Conference, the General finding the Rumps
pretences unreasonable and ambitious, declar'd
himself with the City for a free Parliament, and
came to <hi>Westminster</hi> with the secluded Members,
(whom he had appointed to meet and stay for
him at <hi>White-Hall)</hi> and re-placed them in the
House among the Rumpers; so that now the
same Cattle that were in the House of Commons
in 1640. (except those that were dead, and those
that went from them to the late King at <hi>Oxford)</hi>
are all there again.</p>

               <p>But this methinks was no good service to
the King, unless they had learnt better Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They had learnt nothing; the major part
was now again <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> 'Tis true, they were
so grateful to General <hi>Monk,</hi> as to make him
General of all the Forces in the three Nations:
They did well also to make void the Engagement;
but it was because those Acts were made to the
prejudice of their Party, but recalled none of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103390:145"/>
their own Rebellious Ordinances, nor did any
thing in order to the good of the present King;
but on the contrary, they declar'd by a Vote,
that the late King began the War against his
two Houses.</p>

               <p>The two Houses, considered as two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
were they not two of the Kings Subjects?
If a King raise an Army against his Subject, is it
lawful for the Subject to resist with force, when
(as in this case) he might have had Peace upon
his submission.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They knew they had acted vilely and
sottishly; but because they had always so
greater than ordinary wisdom and godliness,
they were loth to confess it: The <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
now saw their time to make a Confession of their
Faith, and presented it to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
to shew they had not changed their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
which (after six Readings in the House)
was voted to be printed, and once a year to be
read publickly in every Church.</p>

               <p>I say again, this re-establishing of the Long
Parliament was no good service to the King.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Have a little patience: they were re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
with two Conditions; one to determine
their sitting before the end of <hi>March,</hi> another
to send out Writs before their rising for new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That brought in the King; for few of the Long-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
(the Country having felt the smart of their former
service) could get themselves chosen again. This new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103390:146"/>
began to sit <hi>April</hi> the 25. 1660. How soon these
called in the King, with what Joy and Triumph he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
how earnestly his Majesty pressed the Parliament for
the Act of Oblivion, and how few were excepted out of it,
you know as well as I.</p>

Oblivion of their former principles, we are but return'd
to the state we were in at the beginning of the Sedition.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Not so; for before that time, though the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> had the right of the Militia in vertue of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
and without dispute, and without any particular
Act of Parliament directly to the purpose; yet now after
this bloody dispute, the next, which is the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in proper and express terms hath declar'd the same to
be the Right of the King only, without either of his Houses
of Parliament; which Act is more instructive to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than any Arguments drawn from the Title of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
and consequently fitter to disarm the Ambition of
all seditious Haranguers for the time to come.</p>

                  </gap> that this
Parliament has done all that a Parliament can do for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of our peace; which I think also would be enough,
if our Preachers would take heed of instilling evil Principles

                  </gap>through two Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
from the late King, to this his Son; for (leaving out
the power of the Council of Officers, which was but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
and no otherwise owned by them, but in trust) it
moved from King <hi>Charles</hi> the First to the Long Parliament,
from thence to the Rump, from the Rump to <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
and then back again from <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> to the
Rump, thence to the Long Parliament, and thence to King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, where long may it remain.</p>
