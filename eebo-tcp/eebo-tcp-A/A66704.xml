            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Clap but a good Sucker into his Belly, and he makes an excellent Pariſh Pump: and if you add but a Pipe to his Muzle, he may paſs for a Water En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and do good ſervice in time of Fire; you need not fear Drawing him dry, ſo long as all the Ale-houſes, and Taverns in Town, like little Rivulets, ſupply the decreaſe; He contains about as much as thoſe in Churches; but is ſo uncooth a Trough, he's twice as hard to be Gauged: yet by frequent experience, he can gueſs his Meaſure to a Pint, ſpecially if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

Leakage: His Veins are ſo thronged, and his Blood ſo tainted with Scurvey, Gout, and Dropſie, (and a ſmatch of the <hi>French-man</hi> to boot, which he got when he was Drunk, and does not know who to lay it too.) That he defies the intruſion of any other Diſtemper: wherefore he Stalks in as much State through a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; as a well Arm'd Souldier through a ſhower of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, for his forementioned Diſeaſes have taken ſuch large Poſſeſſion of his Body, that there's no room left for Infection.</p>
            <p>He has drunk himſelf into a Jelly, and is ſo moiſt, that if you ſqueeſe him, he drops like an Orange.</p>
            <p>His Body a perfect Still, which he Fuells with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, inſtead of Char-coal; being throughly heated, you may diſcern the ſweaty Diſtilation tricle from his face, as from the Lid of a Limbick, and if any chance to drop on his Noſe, you may hear it hiz as if it fell u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon heated Bricks. In fine though he always lives Joak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and Merry, he hates nothing more then a dry Jeſt.</p>
            <p>Thus having acquainted you with his Conſtitution, I ſhall only conſider him in his Converſation, and Friendſhip, and ſo leave him to ſleep out his nap.</p>
            <p>And firſt for his Converſation, to take him in the Morning (for who can find him all the Day after) he prevents his Pray'rs with a Pipe of Tobacco, and Smoaks at ſuch a Rate as if he pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

A Tinder-box is as neceſſary to him, as a green Bagg to an Atturney's Clark, with which he ſeems as raviſh'd as <hi>Alexander</hi> with the Odiſſes, for he cannot ſleep unleſs it lye under his Pillow. In that little night he makes, he cannot ſo properly ſaid to ſleep, as to chew the Cudd <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

often diſturbs the repoſe of a Family, with Muttering a Repetition of his Oaths, and Healths when he awakes, he ſtares about with ſuch wild Curioſity, as one would fancy <hi>Adam</hi> did immediately after his Creation; for he generally makes himſelf ſo Drunk over Night, drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his paſt actions in Liquor and Oblivion, that he ſcarcely knows the Morning from the Reſurrection, and is hardly perſwaded that ever he lived before.</p>
            <p>But after he is convine'd of the affirmative ſpends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of an Hour in examining the Bed-poſts and Windows, before he diſcovers whether he be in his own Lodging: And afterward remains as doubtful how he got thither.</p>
            <p>Then Bed-ſtaves, and Slip-ſhoo's go to Wrack, for clattering on the Bed-ſtead, like Boys at the Bear-Garden; he calls up the People as Country Wenches do Swine, by knocking; and after a Petition for a Cup of Settle-Brain, begs them to reſolve his Quaerie: Whereupon they tell him the truth, which indeed is that either he came the old Porterly way, Crutch'd with a brace of Watch-men; or elſe the Modern and more Genteel way, <hi>viz.</hi> On Pick-pack, inſtead of a Sadan.</p>
            <p>Now although my <hi>Honeſt Drunken Curr</hi> be guilty of many Vices, which like Younger Brothers hang on this great one which has got poſſeſſion: Yet <hi>(Give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil his aue)</hi> I think the World has Sully'd his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with divers Scandals of which he is no wiſe Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Wherefore becauſe I only intend his Converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not his Conſumption; Like an honeſt Hiſtorian (ſince I Write his Life) I ought not to ſee him wrong'd, but rather to reſcue him from those C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

The firſt imputation therefore that they impoſe on him is that he is proud, <hi>And why forſooth?</hi> but becauſe when he has a <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>op in his Eye,</hi> he brags and vapours as if he were a better man than his Neighbours. A ſtout reaſon indeed? as if any man might not do as much that were either Light-headed, or in a Fevour; Nay, a Paſſion alone makes the wiſeſt of us <hi>Bethlehems.</hi> But let us do as we would be done by, and take him when he is himſelf, (that is in a Morning,) and then I am ſure he is as free from Pride, as a Quaker from good Minners or Ribbons: For would Cuſtome admit, I am confident he would never go to the Ale-houſe Naked, than undergo the hard Pennance of Sobriety the while he dreſſes himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They call him an Idle fellow; a good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all the World knows he is, but as for Idleneſs, let me dye if I know any one more free from it than he; What would they know of him trow? he riſes early, ſits up late; and I dare Swear he grudges himſelf his very Sleep, becauſe it keeps him from his Buſineſſe: When he is at it, no man more expeditious than he, for as if his minutes, like his Eſtate, ran away too faſt, you ſhall frequently ſee him with an Ale-Glaſs in one hand, and a Looking-Glaſs in the other, which beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens both ſpeed and frugality.</p>
            <p>The third and moſt fallacious Accuſation is that they ſay, <hi>He's Prodigal, and Piſſes his Eſtate againſt the Wall.</hi> But I am confident he enriches nor Perfumes the Walls no more than others; onely this I know he does, that whereas Uſurers uſe to hide their Riches in Earth Pots, he puts his Eſtate in a Pewter one (which one would think were the ſafer Cabinet) ſo that it is not the <hi>Honeſt Drunken Cur,</hi> but the Impudent Rogues, <hi>Drawers,</hi> and <hi>Tapſters,</hi> that imbezle and make it away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43177:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Much more might be ſaid of him both in his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and in Commendation alſo: For he is one of the quieteſt Subjects his Majeſty has, and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to Monarchyal Government: He would not be without a King, if it were for no other Reaſon than meerly Drinking his Health. He hates Coffee as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homatizm,</hi> and thinks it a Leſſer ſin to go to Bed Drunk, than to Drink it to make him Sober.</p>
            <p>He hates a Studious man as <hi>Caeſer</hi> did a Lean one, and for the ſame Reaſon, for he is ſo confident he's hatching of Treaſon, that he could find in his Heart to impeach him at adventure.</p>
            <p>As for his Friends he never troubles his Head to pick and cull them, but takes them as ſuperannuated Maids do Husbands, or Fiſh-women do Mackerel, as they come next to hand: For fixing himſelf in the next Ale-houſe or Tavern he comes at; at firſt he ſits as ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly as a degraded Courtier, or an Inſurer upon Advice of a Loſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And no leſs than a Quart of <hi>Purle-Royal,</hi> or Two <hi>Kicks in the Guts</hi> can remove his Moroſity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has digeſted either of them, perchance he'l vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to bleſs you with a Smile, eſpecially if you will purchaſe it at the expence of a Bawdy Song; to which you ſhall ſee him turn head, and liſten as heedfully as a Lynnet to a Flaijolet, but infinitely more eaſie to be Taught.</p>
            <p>When you have done, tis twenty to one but he comes and hugs you; ſwearing you are the moſt accompliſht <hi>Gentleman</hi> that ever he met in his Life; and tho he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw you before, from that time you may date his Friendſhip: He makes Friends faſter than Children do Babies; and like them too, he often forgets where he has left them.</p>

His Reaſon like a bad Shop-keeper is ſeldom at home, or rather like a Country Gentleman, has left the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his own Body; and is gone to dwell in ſtrange Lodgings: So that 'tis no wonder, he's Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin'd by his fiery Noſe to any Debauchery, or that Men call him Beaſt; ſince by giving Rains to his I Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he makes ſo perfect a <hi>Swine</hi> of himſelf, that he Drinks till he can hardly <hi>Grunt.</hi> However, ſince the Church allows him Chriſtian Burial, I'le <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold</hi> him with</p>
