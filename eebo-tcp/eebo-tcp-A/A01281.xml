         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Raging famine is the prime companion of many fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mischiefes. <hi>Ex vno grano oritur aceruus</hi>: of one graine of this staruing misery, ariseth a whole heape of lamentable woes. The attendants of famine are murthers, robberies, rapes, killing of children, that the same vessels become the wombes and toombs of little ones; and innumerable stretchings of conscience, to the reuoking of former, and prouoking of future iudgements. No maruell if hunger disregard the mounds and fences of Gods laws and mans, when it breakes through stone walls. The Poet, somwhat morally describes Famine.

They haue marble bosomes that will not be shaken with these terrors, and haue sucked Tygresses in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that cannot compassionate these calamities.

               <p>I know you haue long looked for an end. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer delighted in prolixity of speech.

Let not our sinnes call backe these plagues: let vs not prouoke our GOD, least earth, ayre, heauen renew their strokes vpon vs. Warres and famines from the earth, plagues from the ayre, iudgementes from the Cloudes; they are all restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at our repentance, let loose at at our rebellions.

               <p>I will not descend into the view of her apostacie, though iust occasion may seeme heere offred; but turne my selfe and speech to our selues, who are <hi>sound</hi> in doctrine, <hi>sicke</hi> in conversation; but (I trust) not without good hope of recouerie.</p>

and striue to haue our owne liues better) we feare not to match them with theirs. Our <hi>sicknesse</hi> would be esteemed lesse, if we would goe to <hi>Rome</hi> for a medicine. (For the Papist may better steale the horse, than the Protestant looke on.) But so long as we haue approoued Phisitions at home, what need we walke so farre to a Mountebanke? It is a false rumour, there is no sound ayre but the Romish. Is it not rather true, that thence comes all infection?
