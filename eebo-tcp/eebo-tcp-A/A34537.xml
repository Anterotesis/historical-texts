         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Preface.</head>
                  <p>THe Indeavours of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
between the Subjects
of the Prince of Peace, and the
Children of the God of Peace, may
be well taken from one who hath
obtained mercy to be an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of Peace, in the Ministry of
Reconciliation. Likewise it may
well become any sincere Protestant,
Loyal Subject, and true Lover of
dear <hi>England,</hi> to study and bring
forth whatsoever hath a tendency
to Reconcile those Parties in whom
both the King, and the Kingdom,
and the Protestant Cause are so
highly concerned. I am therefore
<pb facs="tcp:61567:3"/>
encouraged upon this confidence,
That the offer of a willing mind
in this service is acceptable to
God and good men. The <hi>Peace</hi>
here propounded is the Friend and
Sister of <hi>Truth:</hi> It offers not to
inthrall or burden Consciences of
either Perswasion: By allowing
some diversity of Opinion, it takes
away the difference of Parties, and
permits the Points of Difference
to be matters of Speculation but
not of Practice: As to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Some of the Episcopal way
hold, that a Bishop differs from a
Presbyter in regard of Order; that
he is ordained <hi>ad speciale Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterium.</hi>
Others of the same way
do hold, That they differ not in
Order but Degree: The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
believe they are the same in
<pb facs="tcp:61567:3"/>
regard of Order, yet that a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in Degree may be admitted;
and so they accept of a President-Bishop.
Nevertheless, all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Divines do judg it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
necessary, that a Presbyter be
ordained by a Bishop in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Presbyters; and none of
them (as far as I understand) do
judge it unlawful that Acts of
Church-Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be administred by a Bishop in
the like conjunction: And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the persons of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Perswasions need not divide,
but may easily be made one in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
by the regular consociation of
Episcopacy and Presbytery. The
Peace here pursued was earnestly
expected and promised in the late
great Revolution. Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb facs="tcp:61567:4"/>
common Honesty, yea, Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
pleads for this Peace: They
who now contemn it, if there be
any such, may come to know the
want of it as well as others. Let
them who have gotten the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<hi>rejoyce with trembling: for
who knows what he is doing, and
where is the end of his working,
whose judgments are unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and whose ways are past
finding out?</hi> The most subtile
Politician, whose Writings are not
held to savour much of Religion,
hath this Religious Observation,—<hi>If
we consider the course of
humane Affairs, we shall many
times see things come to pass,
and chances happen, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of which the heavens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
would not that any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:61567:4"/>
should be taken.</hi> Mach.—And
for example he alleadgeth the great
miscarriages of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
in the War with the
<hi>French,</hi> insomuch that they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like to themselves, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Roman Discipline, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for equity, or industry, or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
or foresight, even until they
were brought to the brink of utter
ruine. Certainly if the voice of
Peace cannot be heard in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
time, when it calls and
cries unto us by so manifold pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
engagements, it is of the Lord,
who hath not given an ear to hear,
nor an heart to consider. I am far
from presuming upon the force of
my own reasoning in this matter;
it is the subject it self that is my
confidence, and my heart is in it.
<pb facs="tcp:61567:5"/>
Let the God of Heaven inspire
and prosper the King in His Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Inclinations to the work of
Peace, that all who fear Gods
Name may see that in Him <hi>the Sun
of Righteousness is risen upon
them, with healing in his wings.</hi>
Let the Interest of the Protestant
Religion, and the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> prevail with a Protestant
English Parliament. Let all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
persons, being the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ by special Office,
cease from seeking their own
things, and let them seek the
things which are Jesus Christs:
Be it far from any of them to smite
their fellow-servants whilest they
are doing their Masters work. If
there be any consolation in Christ,
any comfort of Love, any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb facs="tcp:61567:5"/>
of the Spirit, any bowels and
mercies, let all good Christians in
their several places promote the
Peace of Christs Kingdom and
Family by all the ways of equal
and reasonable Condescention and
Forbearance. Lastly, Let the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Reader accept this Labour of
Love, and not undervalue the
weight and worth of the Cause,
for the defects of these Discourses.</p>

and <hi>Ireland,</hi> legally united
in one King, but by violence sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to one Usurped Power of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Forms successively, were for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
late years reeling to and fro like a
drunken man, and driven hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like a Ship in a troubled Sea. The
ancient Fundamental Constitution being
overturned, those who took to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Government, had gotten a
plenary possession of all the strength by
Sea and Land, detected all Conspiracies,
quashed all Insurrections, and by Policy,
Industry, and wonderfull Success, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61567:8"/>
formidable at home and abroad.
The people sorely bruised by a tedious
civil War, were glad of some present
ease, and generally desired nothing more
then to lie down in rest and peace; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the more considerate part of men,
though little satisfied in the present state,
yet fearing other extreams, were nothing
forward to endeavour a totall change,
but thought it most adviseable to take
things as they were, and to bring them,
if it were possible, to some reasonable
temper and consistence. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these advantages, the Powers then
in Being could never settle in a fixed sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
posture; and those who took the first
Turn, namely, that Fragment of the
Commons House, could by no means
advance or get ground in any degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it: For besides the general hatred
of their Usurpation and Selfish Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
their Republican Form, and their
Designs touching Religion were wholly
aliene from the disposition of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He, who put them down from
their Seats, and exalted himself in their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61567:8"/>
room, reducing the Government to a
single Person and a Parliament, set up
an Image of the ancient Form, unto
which the greater number were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to bow down, not out of good
will to the Person, but for the Forms
sake, and hope of Order; And by his
able Conduct of Affairs, he became less
hated and more feared then at the first,
yet not beloved: His chiefest Grandees
in Council and Army he made nothing
to cashiere, when they appeared to take
check at his Proceedings, and so he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have made a fair progress in the
establishing of his new Dominion. But
the truth is, that Party and those means
by which he obtained the Power, would
in no wise permit him to make it sure:
His Army was not like that of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
who had no other aim than to make their
General Lord of the Roman World, and
to share in his fortunes; But it was acted
by working Spirits zealous of peculiar
Notions touching things both Religious
and Civil, utterly repugnant to the way
of generall Satisfaction and National
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61567:9"/>
Settlement. And not onely those of the
standing Army, but the whole body of
that irregular Party throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did generally oppose the Kingship
of this Person, who was their head and
Chief, conceiving, that the best insuring
of their Interest was not by way of legal
Stability; but Sword-security. This
old Leaven their chief Commander
could not purge out, and this Veterane
Party could not with safety be abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or neglected, until a larger tract of
time might beget a better confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the sober part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But in this unsetled posture being
taken off by death he leaves all to a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
depending rather upon the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
of the present Grandees, and the
peoples peaceable inclination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than any
potent abilities or interest of his own.
After a while, the wild spirit of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
before manacled, brake loose, and
instantly dissolved the whole frame of
that new Model. Forthwith they run
into inextricable Errours and Mazes,
through unstable and head-long Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61567:9"/>
they do and undo, build up and pull
down the samethings, and are always
reeling upon the brink of a Precipice:
And at last to hasten an inevitable ruine,
the Army and Party combined with it is
divided against it self, the bonds of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are broken, and things brought into
extream disorder by a spirit of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Giddiness, Perversness, Fury.</p>

it. In this juncture of time the unruly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61567:10"/>
motions and projects of the prevailing
part of the Army received some check by
a Chieftain of High Trust, yet not of
the Army-spirit. Presently the three
Kingdoms gaze upon him, musing
what is the design, and what may be the
issue of his single opposition. Being a
Person deliberate, reserved and resolute;
by ambiguous expressions and winding
Traverses he amuzes all parties, and feels
his way step by step, till he finds when
to declare and where to fix himself. At
length a full Tide of concurring acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
carries him to a closure with the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
part of the Parliamentary party,
who from first to last intended only a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and due regulation of things
in Church and State, but abhorred the
thought of destroying the King, or
changing the Fundamental Laws of the
Kingdom. Whereupon the doors were
set open to the Re-admission of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Members, which necessarily drew
after it the restoring of King, Lords and
Commons, according to the ancient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
Nor was it possible in that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61567:10"/>
state of things, that any other party could
peaceably bring about this much desired
and long expected end: For the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
however changed and much qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
were not so manageable as to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
the stirring of those, who were
then called <hi>Royalists,</hi> but in any such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
they were in all reason likely to
have deserted their General, and from
that rooted principle of self-preservation
to have taken such ways and counsels, as
might put things to a stand, if not to the
utmost hazard. But those prudent and
sober-minded Patriots being re-assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
after so long Exclusion, to put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to those disorders, did not only
prevent the aforesaid mischief, but also
beget a good measure of quietness and
confidence in the minds of that party
which conscientiously adhered to them
in the first Cause asserted by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament, in as much as these
longed for nothing more, then the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the true Reformed Protestant
Religion, and their Civil Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
upon the ancient Foundations,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61567:11"/>
and esteemed the legal settlement of the
Kingdom, to be that regular way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they might expect that God should
meet them, and bless them, and give
them peace, and wherein (whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens)
they should finde security and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to their own Consciences.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Divine Providence having
first prepared the way, brings back King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, drawn in the swiftest
Chariots, even the affections of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
people, and amidst their triumphant
acclamations peaceably sets him upon
the Throne of his Royal Progenitors.
And there let him long sit and reign, and
let his House and Kingdom be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
throughout all Ages. And verily
in this great turning time it is of the
highest importance to inquire and search
how the King and Kingdom, who in so
wonderful manner have been restored to
each other, may be put into a stable
possession of peace, happiness, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
unto all mutual complacency and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>

                     <p>After a dreadful Earthquake shaking
all the Powers of the Kingdom, and
overturning the very Foundations, and
after a new frame of things erected
standing for divers years, and seemingly
stated for perpetuity, the Regal Family
and Government is raised up again, not
by the power or policy of that party
who fought under the Banner of his late
Majesty in the Wars, between Him and
both Houses of Parliament; But by the
restless desire of the Nation, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
actings of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
with the concurrence of the Secluded
Members of the Long Parliament, in
conjunction with that Renowned Person
who then held the power of the Sword:
Which it pleased the King to take notice
of according to His Princely Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention
in His Gracious Speech to the
House of Peers for hastening the Act of
Indempnity. [<hi>My Lords, if you do not
joyn with Me in extinguishing those fears
which keep mens hearts awake, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of safety and security, you keep Me
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61567:12"/>
from performing my promise, which if I
had not made, I am perswaded that neither
I nor you had been now here: I pray you let
Us not deceive those who brought Us, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Us to come together.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>His Majesty thus brought back to a
willing and free-spirited people by their
own Act, beholds his undoubted Interest
set forth to his hand, and made plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, which is no other, then a well
tempered and composed state of Affairs
both Religious and Civil in all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
by the abolishing of former dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
and the reconciling of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
Parties; and especially of
those grand Parties, which (if made one)
do upon the matter carry the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And this His Majesties Wisdom
hath already observed in that excellent
Proclamation against vitious, debauched,
and profane persons in these words [<hi>That
the Reconciliation and Union of hearts and
affections can only with Gods blessing make
us rejoyce in each other, and keep our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
from rejoycing.</hi>] And this is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
expectation and hope of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61567:12"/>
and well affected to publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
That the King, our Supream
Head and Governour, whose gracious
Disposition doth not suffer him to cleave
to any divided part of his Subjects, and
to reject others that are alike Loyal, will
as a Common Father, protect and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
all those that are found capable and
worthy, and become our great Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
by his Authority and Wisdom, to
lessen differencies, and allay Animosities
between dissenting brethren, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
agree in the main Points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
What was it that brought home
His Majesty with such impetuous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; impatience of delay, even in those
as well as others, who must needs know
that an abatement of their particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
would follow? What was it (I say)
but a clear knowledge and foresight,
that all would run to rack and ruin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Publike State did settle speedily
upon a national bottom, which could not
be any other then the ancient Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?
Wherefore let our hearts reioyce
that our Dread Soveraign proceeds to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61567:13"/>
build his Designs, not upon the interest
of any one Party, though numerous and
powerfull, but upon the common Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
and Security of the Nation: So
by the blessing of God he will continue
a happy and mighty King over a happy
and contented people, who will esteem
him their Wealth and Strength and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
because they know, that none
but He under God, can make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,

                     <p>Among the various dis-agreeing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
within this Kingdom, which seem to
render it an indigested Masse of people;
two main ones appear above the rest, of
so large an interest, that if by any means
they might become no more twain, but
one; they would take in, and carry along
the whole stream &amp; strength of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And these two are the <hi>Episcopal</hi>
and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parties, each of them
highly laying claim to the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And undoubtedly whilest these
two remain divided, the Kingdom of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61567:13"/>
                        <hi>England,</hi> and the Protestant Religion is
divided against it self. This dis-union
is removed either by the Abolition of one
Party, or by the Coalition of both into
one. The former if supposed possible,
cannot be accomplished but by violent
and perillous ways and means. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is brought to pass by Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or mutual yielding. Moreover there
is a third way imaginable, Toleration
indulged to the weaker side. In which
of these waies lies the true Interest of the
King and Kingdom is the great Case of
the time, and the Subject of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which presumes not to informe
his Majesty; but in subordination unto
his declared moderation and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
endeavours, by shewing things as
they are, to convince and perswade Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
persons, that the Pacification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
for this <hi>Interim</hi> may be intire and
perfect and fully setled for perpetual
unity. The whole matter rests upon
three main Enquiries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Qu.</hi> Whether in Justice or reason of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61567:14"/>
State the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party should
be Rejected and Depressed, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
and Incouraged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>II Qu.</hi> Whether the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be Protected and Incouraged,
and the Episcopal not Deserted nor
Dis-obliged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>III Q.</hi> Whether the Upholding of both
Parties by a just and equal accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
be not in it self more desirable
and more agreeable to the State of
<hi>England,</hi> than the absolute Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the one Party, and the total
Subversion of the other.</p>
                     <p>And here let none prejudge the matter
by reason of the name <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
which with some is rendred odious; but
let the Character hereafter given be
heedfully observed. Let none take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at the name of <hi>Prelate</hi> or <hi>Prelatist,</hi>
which is not used for envy but for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
sake. Moreover the reasons why
the first Inquiry is propounded on the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61567:14"/>
                        <hi>Presbyterians</hi> behalf, are, because <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
now stands on the rising ground,
and seems to have no need of an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
Also the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> aim not at
an ample, splendid and potent State;
but at Liberty and Security in their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Orbe; and chiefly because they are
by some mis-represented, and by many
mis-apprehended, and pre-condemned as
inconsistent with publick tranquility in
Church or State.</p>

                     <head>Section V.</head>
                     <p>As concerning their true Character,
the Notation of the name whereby they
are called is both too shallow and too
narrow for it. The word <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
hath not sufficient depth to go to the
root of the matter, nor breadth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to comprehend this sort of men.
That Form of Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Parochial and Classical Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Provincial and National Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
is remote enough from their main
Cause, and those firm bonds that make
them eternally one, in respect whereof
many that approve a regulated Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61567:15"/>
will be found of their number. For
there is a vast difference between the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Episcopacy, and the height of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi>
or <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of the latter times. This
later only is the true opposite of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
And so they may not abhor to be
named in several respects both <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
and <hi>Episcopal,</hi> yet not <hi>Prelatical.</hi>
Some of them commend, and I think
most of them here in <hi>England</hi> allow in
order to peace, <hi>Episcopum Praesilem non
Principem.</hi> Wherefore as concerning
their main and rooted principles, they
admire and magnifie the holy Scriptures,
and take them for the absolute perfect
Rule of Faith and Life, without the
supplement of Ecclesiastical Tradition;
yet they deny not due respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to venerable Antiquity. They as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
the study and knowledge of the
Scriptures to be the duty and priviledge
of all Christians, that according to their
several capacities being skilfull in the
word of Righteousness they may discern
between good and evill, and being filled
with all goodness may be able to exhort
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61567:15"/>
and admonish one another: Yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the necessity of a standing
Gospel Ministery, and receive the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
authority of the Church not with
implicite Faith, but the Judgement of
discretion: They hold the teaching of
the Spirit necessary to the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ: Yet they do not hold
that the Spirit bringeth new Revelations,
but that he opens the eyes of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to discern what is of old reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the written Word; They exalt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ordinances, but debase humane
Inventions in Gods Worship, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
Ceremonies properly Religious,
and of Instituted Mystical signification:
Yet they allow the natural expressions of
Reverence and Devotion, as kneeling
and lifting up of the hands and eyes in
prayer; as also those meer Circumstances
of Decency and Order, the omission
whereof would make the service of God
either undecent or less decent. As they
worship God in the spirit according to
the simplicity of Gospel Institutions, so
they rejoyce in Christ Jesus, having no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61567:16"/>
confidence in a legal Righteousness, but
desire to be found in him who is made
unto us Righteousness by gracious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
Yet withall they affirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
that good works of piety towards
God, and of Justice and Charity towards
men are necessary to salvation. Their
Doctrine bears full conformity with that
of the Reformed Churches held forth in
their publiek Confessions, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
with that of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
in the nine and thirty Articles, only one
or two passages peradventure excepted,
so far as they may import the asserting of
<hi>Prelacy</hi> and humane Mysticall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
They insist much on the necessity
of Regeneration, and therein lay the
groundwork for the practise of godliness.
They press upon themselves and others
the severe exercise not of a Popish, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
formall, but a spirituall and reall
mortification, and self-denial, according
to the power of Christianity. They are
strict observers of the Lords day, and
constant in Family prayer: They abstain
from oaths, yea petty oaths, and the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61567:16"/>
usage of Gods name in common
discourse; and in a word, they are sober<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
just and circumspect in their whole beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
Such is the temper and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this party, which in its full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
lies in the middle between those that
affect a Ceremoniall Worship, and the
height of Hierarchical Government on
the one hand, and those that reject an
ordained Ministery and setled Church
order, and regular Unity, on the other
hand.</p>

in the more civilized places, as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Religion their business, and imitate the
<hi>Bereans</hi> commended nobleness, resolving
not to take up Religion upon trust, but
to search the Scriptures daily whether
those things which they hear are so, that

Controversies in the Church from Age
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61567:18"/>
to Age. Let the former times come in
and give Evidence. As touching Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
the Contest began early, even in
King <hi>Edward's</hi> Reign, between <hi>Hooper</hi>
and other Bishops. The Consecration
of <hi>Hooper</hi> Elect Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi> being
stayed because he refused to wear certain
Garments used by Popish Bishops, he
obtained Letters from the King, and
from the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and others, that
he might not be burthened with certain
Rites and Ceremonies, and an Oath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
used in the Consecration of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
which were offensive to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Nevertheless he found but
harsh dealing from his Fellow Bishops,
whereof some were afterwards his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Martyrs, and <hi>Ridley</hi> among others,
who afterwards thus wrote unto him,
when they were both Prisoners for the
Gospel. [<hi>However in time past in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

your wisdom, and my simplicity (I
grant) hath a little jarred, each of us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the abundance of his own sence and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61567:18"/>
judgement; Now be assured, that even with
my whole heart in the Bowels of Christ I
love you in the truth, and for the truths
sake which abideth in us.</hi>] Some godly
Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days disliked
the Ceremonies, and none of them died
in the defence of Ceremonies, Liturgie,
and Prelacy, in opposition to all other
Ecclesiasticall Government and Order.
It was the Protestant Verity which they
witnessed and sealed in blood in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Popery, especially the prodigious
opinion of Transubstantiation, and the
abomination of the Romish Mass, or
Sacrifice. In the same bloody dayes
certain English Protestants being fled for
refuge into <hi>Germany,</hi> and setled in <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
were divided among themselves
about the Service-book, even with scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
breach of Charity, and in the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the Congregation was sadly broken
and dissipated. The Gospel returning
under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> these differnces
were revived and held up by Disputes,
Writings and Addresses to severall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and there were great thoughts
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61567:19"/>
of heart for these Divisions. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the differences remain uncompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
in process of time severe Canons
were framed, and with much rigour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and so continued: Ministers were
distinguished into <hi>Conformists</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformists;</hi>
and a multitude of painfull
Preachers suffered deprivation for <hi>Non-Conformity.</hi>
Be it here observed, that
the persons known by the name of <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
were not Separatists, but
earnestly opposed the separation of the
Brownists, and held Communion with
the Church in publick worship upon
this pacifick principle, that we may not
separate from a true Church blemished
with some corruptions and errors, while
we are not compelled to subscribe to
those errors, nor in our own practice to
submit to those Corruptions. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
it the greatest part of the Ministers
named <hi>Puritans,</hi> yieded Conformity to
those controverted Rites and Formes,
that were by Law or Ganons established,
as to things burdensom not desirable,
in their nature supposed indifferent, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61567:19"/>
in their use many ways offensive; and
groaning more and more under that
yoke of bondage (as they coneeived)
they waited for deliverance, and were,
in the main, of one soul and spirit with
the <hi>Non-Conformists:</hi> And even then
the way called <hi>Puritanism</hi> did not give
but get ground. But now the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
of this way are rooted more
then ever; and those things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

after a long time of search and practice,
the mindes of men are fixed in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

in al reason the imposing of such matters

rest upon any private, temporary, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
occasion, but upon a cause perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and everlasting. Those foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Principles of science and practice,
which give it its proper Being, are
of that firm and fixed nature, that new
contingencies will not alter them, nor
length of time wear them out. They
are the great things of God, which have
a great power over the spirit of man
And they are imbraced by such as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prize them, not for temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
whereof they have no appearance,
but for an internal excellency discerned
in them, as being necessary to the glory
of God and the salvation of men. And
consequently to these men it is not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
at all adventures to be of the
State-Religion, or to believe as the
Church believes. Neither will they be
dissolved or much weakned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
haply of some principall Ones,
who being bought off by preferment
may turn prevaricators: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61567:20"/>
such a falling off, the inward
spirit that actuates the whole body of
them, and knits them to each other, will
remain in full strength and vigour. And
though many others through weakness
or mildness should stagger and give
ground in the points of lesser moment
and more controverted, yet the root of
the matter may remain in them, and as
to the main they may be still where they
were. But what are those great things
for which this sort of men contend?
Surely they are no other then the lively
opening of the pure Doctrine of the
Gospel, the upholding of all Divine
Institutions, particularly the strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Lords day, a laborious
and efficacious Ministry taking hold of
the Conscience and reaching to the heart,
a godly Discipline correcting true and
real scandals and disobedience; in a
word, all the necessary and effectual
means of unfained faith and holy life,
that the Kingdom of God may come in
power. And for these things sake they
are alienated from the height of Prelacy
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61567:21"/>
and the pomp of Ceremonious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
This was well known and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against by the swaying part of the
later <hi>Prelatists;</hi> For in as much as they
could not quell the <hi>Puritans</hi> by the rigid
injunction of Conformity, that they
might give a blow at the root, Lectures
were suppressed, afternoon Sermons on
the Lords day prohibited under pretence
of Catechizing (which was only a bare
rehearsal of the Form of Catechism
for Children, without explication or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of those principles) a Book for
sports and pastimes on Sundays enjoyned
to be read by Ministers in their Parish
Churches under penalty of deprivation,
sundry superstitious Innovations intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
a new Book of Canons compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and a new oath for upholding the
Hierarchy inforced. Far be it from me
to impute these things to all that were in
Judgment Episcopal; for I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
a great, if not the greater part of
them disallowed these Innovations. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
those others that were most
vehement, active, watchful, vigorous,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61567:21"/>
did not by all the aforesaid means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
but rather weaken their Cause,
and lessen themselves in the esteem of
observing men, and the oppressed party
increased in number and vigour. It is
therefore evident that this Interest, for
which we plead, is not like a Meteor
which after a while vanisheth away, but
is of a solid and firme consistence like a
fixed Constellation; And the injuries
done unto it are not of that nature, as to
be acted once and for all, and then to
pass into the grave of oblivion, but they
are lasting pressures to a perpetual regret
and grievance. And should not these
be done away, especially when the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
thereof wil be found not necessary,
but superfluous?</p>

                     <p>There remaineth yet some greater
thing which strikes deep into this Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which at the first glance perhaps may
seem a fancy, but by impartial judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be found a manifest and
weighry truth; namely, that as this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
will never vary from its self, so it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61567:22"/>
will never be extinguished, while the
State of <hi>England</hi> continues Protestant.
I do not now argue from Maximes of
Faith and Religion (as that the life and
power of Christianity shall never fail,
that after the greatest havock of the true
Church, there will be a remnant, a seed,
that shall spring up to a great increase af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little season) but I have here entred
upon a way of reason, and let men of
Reason judge. Suppose that the Persons
now in being of this strict profession
were generally ruined and rooted out,
yet let but the Protestant Doctrine, as
it is by Law established in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> be upheld and preached, and
it will raise up a genuine off-spring of
this people, whose way is no other then
the life and power of that Doctrine, as
it is not onely received by tradition, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
example, or any humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but also imprinted upon the spirit
by a lively energy and operation. And
this I further say and testifie, let but the
free use of the Holy Bible be permitted
to the common people, and this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61567:22"/>
of men will spring up afresh by the
immortall seed of the Word: For that
pure, spiritual, and heavenly Doctrine
pressing internal renovation, or the new
Birth, and the way of holy singularity
and circumspection, and being written
with such Authority and Majesty, must
needs beget, though not in the most, yet
in may, a disposition and practise in
some sort thereunto conformable. This
is evident in reason, if it be granted, that
the sacred Scriptures are apt to make
deep and strong Impressions upon the
minds of men; And whosoever denies
this, as he is in point of Religion Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical,
so of Understanding bruitish?
For even those impious Politicians who
in heart make no account of Religion,
yet will make shew of giving reverence
to it, because it is alwaies seen to have a
mighty influence upon men of all ranks
and degrees. Wherefore upon the
grounds aforesaid I hold it a matter of
unquestionable Verity, that the way in
scorn called <hi>Puritanism</hi> will never utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sink unto <hi>Protestantism</hi> it self shal fail,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61567:23"/>
and Popery be set up with a bloody In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</p>

                     <head>Section XI.</head>
                     <p>And verily if there were a design to
reconcile <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> let all means
be used totally to quash the <hi>Puritanes</hi> or
<hi>Presbyterians;</hi> but if <hi>England</hi> will keep
her self pure from Romish Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
let her be a kinde Mother to these
her Children; For this Interest is one
chief strength of the true Reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion. Let those well known
Principles that strike to the heart of
Popery be brought forth for evidence,
to wit, the perfection of holy Scriptures,
in opposition to unwritten Traditions;
the Authority of Canonical Books; in
opposition to the encroachments of the
<hi>Apocrypha;</hi> the distinct knowledge of
the Doctrine of Salvation according to
every mans capacity, in opposition to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
Faith; the reasonable serving of
God according to the Word, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to blind devotion; Spiritual Gospel
Worship, in opposition to a pompous
train of Ceremonies; the efficacious edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61567:23"/>
use of religious exercises, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the Popish <hi>Opus operatum</hi> or
work done; lastly, the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in opposition to splendid Formality.
Whether the <hi>Prelatical</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
party be the more rooted and grounded
in these Principles, let knowing persons
consider and give judgement. It hath
been observ'd, not by vulgar ones, but by
States-men in former times, that the
<hi>Puritans</hi> stood between the <hi>Papists</hi> and
the swaying part of the later <hi>Prelatists</hi> as
a partition wall, which was therefore to
be broken down (as was reported) to
make way for an attempted reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In those times a <hi>Venetian</hi> Agent in
<hi>England</hi> being intimately acquainted
with the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> here resident,
had fathomed the depth of his Religious
Negotiation touching this grand affair,
and in his account given to the State that
sent him, and since published to the
world, hath these notable observations;
[<hi>That in the Realm of</hi> England <hi>are three
Faction; the</hi> Catholicks, <hi>the</hi> Protestants,
<hi>and the</hi> Puritans. Now saith he [<hi>these
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61567:24"/>
three Factions in Religion, though they all
oppose one another, yet the hatred of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
against Puritans is greater then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Catholicks; and that of Catholicks
is greater against Puritans then against
Protestants; and that of Puritans is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
against Catholicks then Protestants; and
thus both Catholicks and Protestants do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
combine together for the ruine and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Puritans.</hi>] What these Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
are he thus declares, [<hi>they did not
so engage themselves to those particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
(meaning of the Reformation) <hi>but
they have since set themselves to reform the
abuse of Religion by reducing themselves
again to the old practise of their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>]
The Puritans he describes in
these words, [<hi>that being seasoned and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
with the Doctrine of</hi> Calvin, <hi>they
judge the English Reformation imperfect,
and so refused submission to that form of
Policy.</hi>] Such is the account of this
Statesman, both a Forreigner and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
and not to be supposed partial in
favour of Puritans. Now by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
he understands only those that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61567:24"/>
to the English Prelacy. And so
indeed that party have impropriated the
name to themselves, excluding the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
who in the mean while com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of palpable injury, and give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
proof, that they of right have as
much Interest in that venerable name.
As touching the passages here quoted, let
them rest on the Relators credit, and
their own evidence, whatever it be.
What our great Clergie intended, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
nothing, but in equity leave it
questionable. How far they actually
advanced this way, be it collected out
of their own Writings, and other mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Expressions.</p>
                     <p>It is no novelty for Papists to impose
the name of <hi>Puritans</hi> on such as retain
the old Protestant spirit of Antipathy to
<hi>Rome,</hi> which is a good argument to
prove, that in the party more peculiarly
so called, lies the heart and strength of
aversness and enmity to the Heresies
and Idolatries of the Roman Church.
Wherefore, Those Bishops in the
Church of <hi>England</hi> who were heartily
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61567:25"/>
averse from Popish Innovations, were
more benigne and favorable to <hi>Puritans,</hi>
and themselves accounted <hi>Puritan</hi> by the
adverse party, and upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Gentry of this Kingdom
were so esteemed. And let it be well
observed that the more primitive times
of <hi>Protestantism</hi> were more leaning to
that which Romanizing spirits have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Puritanism.</hi> (Pardon the frequent
use of this terme, for I glory not in it,
but am constrained to use it for distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
sake, in bringing former things to
remembrance.) Should not King, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and Commons remember their
Darling <hi>Protestiantism,</hi> and not abandon
that sort of persons which contribute so
much to the upholding of it. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
there have been some scandals
given, yet more taken. But in this case
let the saying of our blessed Lord be
minded. <hi>Not only woe to the man by
whom the offence cometh, but woe to the
world because of offences.</hi> It will not be
well with <hi>England</hi> while we give way to
passion and prejudices from offences ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61567:25"/>
and so run from one extream to
another. Where is the wise Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour?
Can we come to no temper? Is
there no healing for us? Shall we sleep
securely whilest the Seedsmen of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
One, the Jesui's and other Romish
Agents, sow the Tares of Division in our
Field, not only to weaken and hinder,
but to choak and eat out our common
Faith? Yea blessed be God for our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soveraign, who makes it his care
and study to allay distempers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
differences by his just and gracious

                     <p>The Presbyterians are loaded with
many calumnies; as that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

from it the power in Causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
that they erect</hi> Imperium in Imperio,
<hi>is a groundless and gross mistake. Take
the declared Judgment of the highest in
that way according to their own words.</hi>
[To the Political Magistrate is allowed a
diatactick, ordering, regulating power about
Ecclesiastical Matters in a Political way.
So that he warrantably reforms the Church,
when corrupted in Divine Worship, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
or Government. He convenes and
convocates Synods and Councils made up of
Ecclesiastical persons, to advise and conclude
determinatively, according to the Word of
God, how the Church is to be reformed and
refined from corruption, and how to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and governed, when reformed. He
ratifies and establishes within his Dominions
the just and necessary Decrees of the Church
in Synods and Councils by his Civil San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
He judgeth and determineth defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
with a consequent political judgement
or judgement of discretion, concerning
things judged and determined antecedently
by the Church in reference to his own act.
He takes care politically, that even Matters
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61567:26"/>
and Ordinances meerly and formally Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
be duely managed by Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
persons orderly called thereunto. He hath
a compulsive, punitive, or corrective power
formally political in matters of Religion in
reference to all sorts of persons and things
under his Jurisdiction. He may politically
compel the outward man of all persons,
Church-Officers, or others under his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
unto external performance of their
respective Duties and Offices in matters of
Religion, punishing them, if either they
neglect to do their Duty at all, or do it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly.]
<hi>Thus they yield unto the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magistrate a supream political
power in all spiritual matters, but they
do not yield that he is the Fountain of
spiritual power, there being a spiritual
power belonging to the Church, if there
were no Christian Magistrate in the
world. They assert only a spiritual
power over the Conscience, as intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
belonging to the Church; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that no Decree or Canon of
the Church can be a binding Law to the
Subjects of any Kingdom under tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61567:27"/>
penalties, till it be ratified by the
Legislative power of that Kingdome,
And, they do not claim for the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or any other Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
an Independency on Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
if they did, surely the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Claim.</hi>

                     <p>There goes a voice, that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
are Antimonarchical; But are their
Principles inconsistent with Monarchy,
or any impeachment to the same? These
are contained in the character above-written;
let any of them be called into
question, and let Sentence be past upon
them, if they be found guilty; but if no
particular be herewith charged, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
must pass for calumniation, not
accusation. Peradventure the exact
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> that is, the parity of degree
and authority in all Ministers, is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which this charge is directed: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this parity is not insisted upon, or

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61567:27"/>
can be rendred why this may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

would this sort of men have no King to

better please them? Did the English or
Scottish <hi>Presbyters</hi> ever go about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Monarchy, and to erect some other
kind of Government? In no wise: for
in the Solemn League and Covenant
they bound themselves to endeavour the
preservation of the Kings person and
Authority, and declared they had no
intent to diminish his Majesties just pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and greatness. After the violent
change of Government, they came slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and entred latest into those new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
imposed by the usurp'd Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and some utterly refused, even to the
forfeiture of their preferments, and the
hazard of their livelihoods, when the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in general submitted to the yoke; and
many of those who thus object against
them, did in temporizing run with the
foremost. The truth is, the generality
of Conscientious Presbyterians never
ran with the current of those times. Some
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61567:28"/>
more eminent among them, Ministers
and others, hazarded their lives, and
others lost their lives in combining to
bring our Soveraign, that now is, to the
rightful possession of this His Kingdom.
And those in <hi>Scotland</hi> adventured no
more then all to uphold him; and when
He lost the day, they lost their Liberty,
and when He fell, it was said by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
<hi>Presbytery was fallen.</hi> I have
known when keeping company with the
chief Presbyterian Ministers hath been
objected by the Republican Council of
State for a crime causing Imprisonment.
Lastly, the Presbyterians by their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
first divided, and then dissipated the
Sectarian party, and so made way for
his Majesties Return in peace. And it
is acknowledged by some eminent on
the Episcopal side, that the sence of the
Covenant hath lately quickned many
mens Consciences in their Allegiance to
the King, so as to bring him with <hi>David</hi>
home in infinite joy and triumph. All
which do shew plainly, that they are not
averse from Regal Government, or the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61567:28"/>
Royal Family, but they desire to dwell
under the shadow of our dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
hoping to renive as the Corn, and
to grow as the Vine under his gracious
influence. Peradventure it is said, they
would enervate Monarchy, and render
it too impotent. Surely I cannot finde
the rise of this Objection, unless from
hence, that they were not willing to come
under any yoke but that of the Laws of
the Realm, or to pay arbitrary Taxes
levied without consent of Parliament. I
confess there are none that more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
their Liberties, and value the native
happiness of the free born Subjects of
<hi>England.</hi> And verily their true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and sense of the nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion makes a due freedom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
precious: For this Religion is
not variable according to the will of
man, but grounded upon an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and eternall truth, and doth indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly
binde every Soul high and low
to one divine law and rule perpetual and
unalterable. And therefore it doth
strongly plead the expedience of a due
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61567:29"/>
civil liberty on the behalf of its Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
yet such a liberty as will not infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Monarchy, nor the legal power of
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> And without
controversie, a King ruling a free people
hath a power much more noble and
more free, then he that ruleth over per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Vassals, that hath no Propriety.
The power is more noble, because it
hath a more noble subject of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it is more honourable to rule men
then beasts, and Free men then Slaves.
Likewise the power is more free: For
whatsoever Prince hath not his power
limited by his peoples legal freedom, he
will be bound up some other way, either
by the potency of subordinate Princes
and great Lords within the Realm, or
by a veterane Army, as the Turkish
Emperour by his Janizaries, and the
Roman <hi>Caesars</hi> by the Pretorian Bands
and the Legions. Upon which account,
to be a powerful Monarch over a free
people, is the freedom and glory of our
Soveraign Lord, above all the Potentates
on earth.</p>

                     <p>But Rebellion and Disobedience is
the loud out-cry of some against this
party. And this were a crying sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
But let not sober minds be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into prejudice by such exclamations
and out-cries. It were to be wished, for
common peace and amity, that the late
public discords were eternally forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
But seeing some in these times of
expected Reconciliation will not cease
to implead and condemn the honest
minded, and render them odious to the
higher Powers, a necessity is laid upon
us to speak something Apologetical, at
least to mitigate the business and remove
prejudice. The Presbyterian party in
<hi>England</hi> never engaged under a less Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
than that of both Houses of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
I have read that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> hath several capacities,
and among the rest, these two; First,
that it represents the people as Subjects,
and so it can do nothing but manifest
their grievances, and petition for relief.
Secondly, that by the constitution it hath
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61567:30"/>
part in the Soveraignty, and so it hath
part in the legislative power, and in the
final judgment. Now when as a part of
the Legislative Power resides in the two
Houses, as also a power to redress grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and to call into question all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of State and Justice, and all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of whatsoever degree in case of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency,
it might be thought that a
part of the supream power doth reside in
them, though they have not the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Title: And this part of the supream
power is indeed capable of doing wrong;
yet how it might be guilty of Rebellion
is more difficult to conceive. In this
high and tender point it belongs not to
me to determine. And as touching the
much debated point of resisting the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
powers, without passing any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the great Case of <hi>England,</hi> I
shall only make rehearsal of the words of
<hi>Grotius</hi> a man of Renown, and known
to be neither Anti-monarchical, nor
Anti-prelatical, which are found in his
Book <hi>de jure belli &amp; pacis,</hi> by himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the French King. [<hi>Si Rex

lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>s.</hi> 13. With reverence to
Soveraign Majesty I crave leave to speak
this word of truth and soberness. In a
knowing age flattery doth not really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
or secure the Royal Prerogative; the
Authority of Parliaments being depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and undervalued is the more search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into and urged. Concerning the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
bounds and limits of Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
and Parliamentary Power the
Law in deep wisedom chuseth to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
for it always supposeth union, not
division between King and Parliament.
Wherefore the overstraining on either
hand, let all men forbear: His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
wisedom and goodness, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
obedience and loyalty in all ways of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61567:31"/>
mutual satisfaction will best secure His
Prerogative and their Liberty. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
as to the point of Loyalty now in
question, the subversion of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Government of this Kingdome
could not be effected, till those Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>Parliament</hi> that were <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
were many of them imprisoned, others
forcibly secluded by the violence of the
Army, and the rest thereupon withdrew
from the House of Commons. For
they had voted the Kings Concessions, a
ground sufficient for the Houses to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeed
to settle the Nation, and were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to cast whatsoever they contended
for upon a legal security. In those times
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers of <hi>London</hi> in
their publick vindication thus declare
themselves. [<hi>We profess before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, that we verily believe that
that which is so much feared to be now in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation,
the taking away of the life of the
King in this present way of Tryal, is not
only not agreeable to the Word of God, the
Principles of the Protestant Religion (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet stained with the least drop of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61567:31"/>
blood of a King) or the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and Government of this Kingdom,
but contrary to them, as also to the Oath of
Allegiance, the Protestation of</hi> May 5.
1641. <hi>and the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
from all which, or any of which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
we know not any Power on earth
able to absolve us or others.</hi>] And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
they warn and exhort men to
pray for the King, that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the violence of men, that they
may not dare to draw upon themselves
and the Kingdome the blood of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.
Let prudent men weigh things
in the ballance of Reason. Is there any
thing in the nature of <hi>Prelacy</hi> that frames
the mind to obedience and loyalty? or
is there any thing in the nature of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
that inclines to rebellion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience?
If Loyalty be the innate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> how comes it to pass,
that in ancient times, and for a series of
many ages, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have
had such tedious conflicts with <hi>Prelates</hi>
in their Dominions? If <hi>Presbytery</hi> and
Rebellion be connatural, how comes it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61567:32"/>
to pass, that those States or Kingdomes
where it hath been established or tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
have for any time been free from
broyls and commotions? or that <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
have never disclaimed or abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their lawful Prince, that they have
never ceased to sollicite and supplicate
his regards and favour, even when their
power hath been at the highest, and his
sunk lowest; yea, that they have suffered
themselves rather to be trodden under
foot, then to comply with men of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in changing the Government?
Let us further examine, are the persons
that adhere to <hi>Prelacy</hi> more conscientious
in duty to God and man then those that
affect <hi>Presbytery?</hi> Are the former only
sober, just and godly, and the latter vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
unrighteous, prophane? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
if it hath been the lot of the one for
a time to comply more with Kings then
the other hath done, it ariseth not from
any peculiar innate disposition of the
one or the other, but somthing extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and accidental, and what that may
be, let prudent men make their own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</p>

                     <p>Their principles, whose cause is now
pleaded, if faithfully received and kept
will make good men and good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and therefore cannot but make good
subjects. When men have learned to
fear God, they will honour the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and none are more observant of
righteous Laws then they that are most
a law to themselves, yea their pattern and
practice will be a law to many others,
and consequently a main help to civil
Government in a Christian Nation:
Whosoever they be that teach blind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
Presbyterians teach faith and
holiness, as also obedience active in all
lawful things, and passive in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
injoyned by the higher power. In
the late distracted times the publick State
was out of frame, always ready to fall
asunder, the minds of people were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
and unsetled; those that held the
power could never gain half that awful
regard and reverence which was given to
Kings, Nobles, and men of Authority in
former times. Nevertheless; prophaness,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61567:33"/>
intemperance, revellings, out-rages, and
filthy lewdness, were not at any time in
the memory of the present age, held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
more restraint. Surely some special
reason may be rendred, why in such want
of publick Order, there should not be a
greater disorder in mens lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
then at other times; which I conceive
is manifest, to wit, that by means of
a practical Ministery more thick set
throughout the Nation, knowledge and
restraining grace did more abound, and
the orderly walking of religious persons
did keep others more within compass,
and withal, strictness of life was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
derided under the name of <hi>Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi>
Those places where <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Ministers had the greatest influence, were
evidently the most reformed and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,
for which cause they were so much
hated by men of loose principles and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
lives. Whereupon we affirm bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That those for whom we plead must
needs be good Subjects to a Christian
King, and good members of a Christian
Common-wealth.</p>

given to change, fit to overturn and
pull down, but not to build up. They do
not hang in the air, bur build upon a firm

with the rules of stable policy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
Fanaticks (truly and not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
so called) do build castles in the air,
and are fit instruments to disturb and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
and root out, but never to compose
and plant and settle; for which cause their
Kingdom could never hold long in any
time or place of the world. Upon this
ground <hi>Presbytery,</hi> not sectarian Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
hath been assaulted with greatest
violence by the more observing <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists;</hi>
against this they have raised their
main batteries, this appeared formidable,
for it is stable and uniform, and like to
hold if once setled in good earnest. This
party do not run so fast, but they know
where to stop; they are a number of men
so fixed and constant as none more, and
a Prince or State shall know where
to find them. They do not strain so high,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61567:34"/>
but they consider withal what the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world will bear, and are
willing to bring things to the capacity of
political Government. They can have
no pleasure in commotions and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for order and regular unity is their
way, and therefore stability of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and publick tranquility is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
It is most unreasonable to object,
that the late wilde postures, extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and incongruities in Government,
were the work of <hi>Presbytery</hi> or <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
The Nation had never proof of
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> for it was never setled, but
rather decryed and exposed to prejudice
by those that were in sway, and that in
the more early times of the late Wars.
The truth of this matter is cleared by a
passage of our late Soveraign in a Letter
to his Majesty that now is.] <hi>All the lesser
Factions were at first officious Servants to
Presbytery their great Master, till time and
Military Success discovering to each their
particular advantages, invited them to part
stakes, and leaving the joynt stock of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Religion, pretended each to drive for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61567:34"/>
their party the trade of profits and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to the breaking and undoing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Church and State, but of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
it self.</hi>] Thus the joynt stock of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Religion was left, and Presbytery
neglected, before the first War was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Yea, and those that stedsastly adhered
to it were maligned and reviled by the
exorbitant party for opposing their new
models or agreements of the people.</p>

                     <p>Neither can Sects or Schisms with any
truth or justice be reckoned the Off-spring
of Presbytery. Consider the
<hi>French, Dutch, Helvetian</hi> Churches, how
intire they keep themselves in Orthodox
Vnity from the Gangreen of Sects and
Schisms. A wide Breach was once
made in the Netherlands by <hi>Arminius</hi>
and his Followers, but after some years
conflict, it was healed by the Synod of
<hi>Dort.</hi> The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to none in the unity of Doctrine
and Church-Communion; and their
form of Ecclesiastical Policy, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Discipline is very effectual to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61567:35"/>
prevent the broaching of Errour. King
<hi>James</hi> in discourse with an English Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
is reported to have rendred this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
why so few Heresies and Errours
of Doctrine are united and prosecuted
to the publick disturbance of that
Church. [Every Parish hath their Pastor
ever present with them, and watching
over them, and he with his Elders and
Deacons hath a weekly meeting for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of manners, by which he perfectly
knows his Flock, and every abberation of
them in doctrine &amp; practise; and lest any
heresie might seize upon the Pastor, they
have their Presbyters, which meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
once also every week in the next
chief Town or City; and there they have
their exercise of prophesying, after which
the Moderator asks the judgement of all
the Pastors concerning the doctrine then
delivered, or of any other doubtful point
then propounded; and if the <hi>Presbytery</hi>
be divided in their opinions, the question
is, under an injoyned silence, put over

with their Elders; and any
question of doubt is either decided by
that Assembly, or with charge of silence
reserved to a national Synod which they
hold every year once, whither come not
the Pastors onely, but the King himself,
or his Commissioners, and some of all
orders and degrees, sufficiently authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
for determining of any controversie
that shall arise among them.] Could the
Bishops in former times procure a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
unity in the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
Whence therefore should this charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise?
peradventure some <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
have turned Sectaries. Surely it would
be taken for a weak arguing, to say, That
<hi>Prelacy</hi> is the way to Popery, because
some <hi>Prelatists</hi> have turned Papists.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, Sectarianism grew up in
a Mystery of Iniquity and State policy,
and it was not well discerned, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
almost triumphant by Military
successes. But after that its growth and
strength did manifestly appear, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
began to struggle with it, and so
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61567:36"/>
continued, until by the power of the
Army it was inforced to sit down, but
never to comply. Whereupon the
tongues and pens of Sectaries were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
against none more then the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians.
And I should be glad to
hear of such bitter Invectives of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
against the <hi>Prelatists;</hi> not that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the sin of the one, or the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the other; but that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
friends of <hi>Prelacy</hi> might more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to their <hi>Protestant Presbyterian</hi>
Brethren. Surely the way to prevent
the growth of the two utmost extreams,
is, for the two middle parties to draw up
and close together. But however the
world goes, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> shall ever
keep as good a distance from the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or Fanaticks, as the <hi>Prelatists</hi> shall
from <hi>Papists.</hi> And verily there is no
greater bar against Fanaticism then the
right <hi>Presbyterian</hi> principles; as not to
sever but joyn the written word and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
for direction; the spirit and use of
Ordinances for Edification; to erect a
stated Church-Order and Discipline;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61567:36"/>
to allow to the Church a directive, and
to every Christian a discretive judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
to insist only upon Divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Warrant, and to wave humane
authority in matters of Religion: For
such is the temperament of these Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes,
that they commend and require
a distinct knowledge and illumination in
the mind, and in the affections lively
motions and stirrings against Formality
and blind Devotion; and so do satisfie
the minds of those, who conceive that
in true Religion there is spiritual light,
and life and power; and also they shew
the necessity of the written Word, of
constant publick Ordinances, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Exercises of Religion, and of the
direction and discipline of the Church;
all which do serve to settle the mind
against dilusive impulses, and wild fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and raptures.</p>

                     <p>But of all the prejudices and scandals
taken against this way, there is none
greater then this, that it is represented as
tyrannical and domineering, and that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61567:37"/>
those who live under it must like <hi>Issachar</hi>
crouch under the burdens. In the first
place let us rightly understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this prejudice. Is it because this
Discipline doth censure scandalous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and enquire into the state of the
flock, as watching over their souls? This
is its high commendation in the sight of
God and good men. Doth Episcopacy
care for none of these things? Surely a
Bishop is an Overseer; to exercise the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Bishop is to take the oversight
of the Church; and those that are over
us in the Lord watch for our souls, as
those that must give an account thereof.
Howbeit Presbytery is not more severe
in censuring the breach of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
then the Hierarchy in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
the breach of their own constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Or is the offence taken upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> affect and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
an arbitrary power, would rule by
faction, and exercise a rigout to the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of animosities and unquiet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours?
Since the friends of <hi>Prelacy</hi> are
loudest in this crimination, I crave leave
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61567:37"/>
to use this mild retortion. Is there no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of domination in <hi>Prelacy?</hi> Was
nothing like unto it objected to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Clergy? If you say those invectives
and clamours were false and scandalous,
then let reason and charity be permitted
to make some Apologie for the other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
which the Nation hath hitherto
never experienced in any measure of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
uniformity and settlement. But
there are remedies at hand to prevent the
abuse of any Government that is of it self
lawful and laudable. Certainly the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the King and Parliament, with
the advice of grave Divines, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
sure and certain rules of discipline.
Moreover, to cut off all occasion, and
prevent all appearance of domineering,
all political coercive jurisdiction in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion, may be with-held (if
need require) from Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and that meer spiritual power alone
which is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to their office, may
be left to their management, which is in
the Name of Christ, and by Authority
from him, to admonish the untuly; and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61567:38"/>
if they continue obstinate, by the same
Authority to declare them unworthy of
Church-Communion, and Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and to require the Lords people to
have no fellowship with them, that they
may be afflicted and humbled. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
spiritual censures appertaining only
to the Conseience may be too little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
when no temporal dammage is
annexed to them, there may be a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
civil power always present in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Meetings, to take cognizance
of all Causes therein debated and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
in order to temporal penalties.</p>
                     <p>Vpon the whole matter aforegoing
we firmly build this position, <hi>That the
Presbyterian Party ought not in Justice or
Reason of State to be rejected and depressed,
but ought to be protected and encouraged.</hi>
Nevertheless there being a seeming
complication in this business, and an
other ample party appearing in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
a difficultie remains, and the
matter falls into a further deliberation.
And thereupon we are fallen upon the
second main Enquiry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61567:38"/>
                        <hi>II Qu.</hi> Whether the Presbyterian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be protected and encouraged,
and the Episcopal not deserted nor
disobliged.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="19" type="section">
                     <head>Section XIX.</head>
                     <p>The grand Expedient in this difficulty
is a well grounded Accomodation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
an intire and firm union. That
the Accommodation may be true and
solid, not loose and hollow, it must be
such as will content and satisfie for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;
and that it may be such, the
tearms thereof must not be repugnant to
the conscientious principles of either
party. Otherwise whatsoever it be, it
is but a botch, and will never hold.
Wherefore we now examine whether
those principles are such as set the parties
at an irreconcileable distance, or else
make the proposed union possible and
hopeful. As touching holy Doctrine,
they both receive the nine and thirty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> unless
that one side may demurr upon one or
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61567:39"/>
two passages respecting the Form of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Government and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
being the matters now in question,
and remote from the foundation. And
in very deed the Doctrine of the English
Bishops, in general, that lived in the elder
times of Protestantism, as <hi>Jewel, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington,
Babington,</hi> and of the latter Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
their Followers, as <hi>Abbot, Carleton,
Morton, Usher, Hall, Davenant,</hi> is intirely
imbraced by the Presbyterians; when
as many of the latter <hi>Prelatists</hi> departed
from it, in the great point of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Redemption, Free-will, effectual
Grace, Perseverance, and Assurance of
Salvation, and termed it <hi>Puritan Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
Whereupon I conclude that
those <hi>Prelatists</hi> of this Age, who are the
genuine Off-spring of the old Episcopal
Divines, will not divide from <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
upon the account of Doctrine; and
that the other sort need not divide from
them any more then from the rest, that
are of the Episcopal Perswasion. But
in the Form of Church Government the
breach is much wider, and the Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61567:39"/>
seems more difficult. Indeed
the Dominion of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> parity are opposite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.
Nevertheless, a regulated <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi>
and <hi>Presbytery</hi> may be found so
far from mutual opposition and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency,
that they may close together
in a sweet Harmony. The Scripture
Bishop and the Evangelical Pastor is one
and the same Officer. The Primitive
Ecclesiastical Episcopacy was not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Antients a different Order of
Ministery. The Bishop was only a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
in a higher degree, the President
of the Presbytery, and ruled in conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
with all the Presbyters. The
better part of the Scool-men place the
difference only in degree, not in order.
Of the same judgement were the old
Episcopal Divines in <hi>England,</hi> and even
in the last times <hi>Morton, Hall,</hi> and <hi>Usher.</hi>
Whereupon they held the Forreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches that had no Prelaies to
be true Churches, and their Pastors true
Ministers of Christ. And this is very
remarkable in the most rigid Prelatists of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61567:40"/>
their times, when upon the new erecting
of Prelacy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> certain Scottish
Bishops were to be consecrated here in
<hi>England,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> moved this
question, whether they ought not first to
be ordained Presbyters, as having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no Ordination from a Bishop; Arch-Bishop
<hi>Bancroft</hi> being there present,
maintained there was no necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination;
for where a Bishop cannot
be had, Ordination given by Presbyters
must be esteemed lawful. This Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being applauded by the other Bishops,
Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> acquiesced. On the
other side, an absolute equality among
Ministers is not essential to Presbytery:
but a prudential priority according to the
Churches occasions, and consequently
a stated Presidency may be admitted:
For the main principle of Presbytery is
this, That every Minister is truly a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
and that pastoral Authority includes
both teaching and ruling; for which cause
the <hi>Presbyters</hi> may not yield up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as the Bishops meer Curates or
Subjects. For that would nullifie their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61567:40"/>
Pastoral Office, as to one part thereof,
which is as essential to it as the other; in
regard whereof the Presbyters are in
Scripture called <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Overseers,</hi>
and are charged to take the oversight of
the Flock. But this is no way violated
by admitting a stated Moderator or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
Bishop. As concerning Worship
or Divine Service, we conclude that
those who agree in the Doctrine of Faith
cannot disagree in the substance of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
They differ only about the Liturgy
and Ceremonies. And the dissenting side
oppose not all Liturgy, but desire that
the present form may be changed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
They oppose not any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Decency and Order, but desire
that mystical Ceremonies of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
may be abolished or not injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

                     <p>Thus the Coalition of these two Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
into one appeareth possible, because
their conscientious principles on both
sides have not that repugnancy, but that
they may well close together in a due

this conjunction, but the obstinacy
either of one or both parties from a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of opposition, or incurable enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or some carnal designe. Among the
Bishops and Episcopal Doctors, some of
the most eminent have witnessed to the
world their desires of Accommodation
by their endeavours and proposals that
way. The Presbyterians preferr an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
accommodation, though upon yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
terms, before division with an intire
Toleration. The incomparable Bishop
<hi>Usher</hi> in the beginning of the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
proposed his model, Intituled, <hi>The
Reduction of Episcopacy unto the form of
Synodical Government received in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church, as an expedient for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primizing
of the now differences,</hi> thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
[<hi>That by Order of the Church of</hi>
England <hi>all Presbyters are charged to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Doctrine, Sacraments, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of Christ, as the Lord hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and as this Realm hath received the
same. And that they might the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61567:41"/>
what the Lord hath commanded
therein, the Exhortation of St.</hi> Paul <hi>to the
Elders of the Church of</hi> Ephesus <hi>is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be read unto them at the time of
their Ordination,</hi> Take heed to your
selves, and to all the flock, among whom
the Holy Ghost hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers,
to rule the Congregation of God
which he hath purchased with his own
blood.] Mark well how this pious lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Prelate declares his own sence, and
interprets the meaning of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> that the Holy Ghost hath made
all Ordained Ministers Bishops or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers,
to rule the Congregation of God.
He saith further, [<hi>Though in our Church
this kinde of Presbyterial Government hath
been long dis-used, yet seeing it still profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that every Pastor hath a right to rule
the Church, and to minister the Discipline
of Christ, as well as to dispense the Doctrine
and Sacraments: And the restraint of the
exercise of this Right proceeds onely from
the custom now received in this Realm; no
man can doubt but by another Law of the
Land this hinderance may be well remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>]
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61567:42"/>

these or such like Proposals, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the agreement in that great and
most difficult point in difference (to wit)
<hi>Church-Government?</hi>

                     <p>If both parties refuse to meet each

way, the weaker party must needs be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated.
There is indeed a third way, by

that in the present case it is so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent

Wherefore the Question lies
between an Accommodation and a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
which of these two shall be
chosen; and why the former is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
for both sides then the latter, I
offer these arguments: And first, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiformity
of Religion publickly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
doth not well comport with the spirit
of this Nation, which is free, eager, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
apt to animosities and jealousies,
besides that it hath ever had a strong
propension to Uniformity. Also, it is too
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61567:42"/>
well known, that the dividing of Church
communion is the dividing of hearts, and
that we shall not live like brethren, till
we agree to walk in one way. Only let
this be well observed and ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that the necessary and injoyned
terms of this Unity be not in things su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
but necessary at least for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
order and peace. Moreover, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
being not the daughter of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
but of Enmity (at least) in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
supposeth the party tolerated to be
a burden, especially if conceived dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the way established, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
holds no longer then meer neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
compels; and consequently neither
party take themselves to be safe, the one
alwaies fearing to lose its authority, and
the other its liberty. And if men will
lay aside self-conceit and fond indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to the way of their own perswasion,
they will quickly finde, that the temper
of this Kingdom doth not well accord
with extreams on either hand. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
well-minded and serious people were
never better prepared for an equall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61567:43"/>
They are weary of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
dissentions in Church and State,
and have seen &amp; felt the sad consequents
thereof; and could they once attain to
setled union, upon the same grounds
they would do their utmost to hold and
keep it inviolable. Without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
the earnest thoughts of such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poture
did expedite the peaceable return
of his Majesty. The Presbyterians vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
acted for it; although they knew
there were some that breathed out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and cruelty against them, yet they
hoped that the prevailing part would be
sober, and carry it with all moderation,
But they relyed chiefly upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
Wisdom, Equity and Goodness,
whose Virtues (attested by faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses)
proclaimed him the Soveraign
Reconciler and Healer of our breaches.
And surely they will never repent of
their honesty and loyalty. And let them
rest assured, that their moderation shall
plead for them in the time to come.</p>

                     <p>That Prelacy, as it stood in <hi>England,</hi>
is not essential to a Church-State, we call
to witness the far greater number of
Protestant Episcopal Divines, yea the

next fore-going our Civil wars. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Bancroft,</hi> no way indulgent to
Presbytery, withstood the re-ordaining
of those Scottish Presbyters elect Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
upon this reason, That they might
not seem to question the Ministry of
the Reformed Churches. For which
cause, who can forbear to censure the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
absurdity of some latter Prelatists,
that unchurch all the forreign Reformed
Churches, and nullifie their Ministery
and Ordinances? They have taken up a
most destructive killing opinion, which

Church) lets out the Vitals of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61567:44"/>
Protestant Cause and Religion. And
shall any that are hearty Protestants be
fond of such Opinionists? Moreover,
it is no less evident that the Prelacy, as it
stood in <hi>England,</hi> is without the warrant
of Divine right, and that not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Lordly titles and exercise of
temporal Dominion, but also in regard
of sole Jurisdiction and deputation of
power. Is there any text in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
where the name and work of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is appropriated to a superior Order
or degree in the Ministery? Do not all
the texts of Scripture that mention the
name and work of a Bishop attribute
both to all ordained Ministers? Can
there be a clearer evidence that a Bishop
and Presbyter is the same spirituall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer?
Besides, to maintain the Divine
right of Prelacy, it sufficeth not to shew
from Scripture any kinde of difference
between a Bishop and a Presbyter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it can be likewise proved that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is the alone subject or receptacle of
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, that he alone
hath rule and government over all the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61567:45"/>
Presbyters within his limits, yea, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the Churches, leaving no power
to the Presbyters but to execute his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.
But there is nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
then that the Holy Ghost hath
made all Presbyters to be Bishops or
Overseers, and hath commanded them
to rule the Church, and to exercise Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
or to take the oversight thereof.
And that this is the sence of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is manifest by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
the exhortation of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to
the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
and the character and qualification of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
written by the same Apostle unto
<hi>Timothy,</hi> to be read unto Presbyters at
the time of their Ordination. Hereupon
a late famous Defender of Prelacy was
driven to leave the beaten path of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Divines, and to take a new way,
but to the ruine of the Cause maintained
by him. He saith [<hi>That although the
Title of</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Elders, <hi>hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to a second Order in the Church, and
is now in use onely for them under the name
of Presbyters, yet in the Scripture times it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61567:45"/>
belonged principally, if not only, to Bishops,
there being no evidence that any of that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Order were then instituted, though
soon after, before the Writings of</hi> Ignatius,
<hi>such were instituted in all Churches.</hi>] Here
it is fully granted that the Scripture
Presbyters were Bishops, and that the
second Order of meer Presbyters, which
were no Bishops, was not then instituted;
whereupon it follows, that a meer Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
who is no Bishop, is not of divine
institution, but a meer humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if the holy Scriptures be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Rule of all Divine Institutions. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the abatement of Prelacy unto
moderate Episcopacy or Presidency any
departure from the practice of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church, but a true reviving of the
same, which was an election made by
the Presbyters of one of their own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to preside amongst them, and that
upon no pretence of Divine Right, but
for remedy of Schism, as <hi>Jerome</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth.
And with this Bishop or Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the whole Presbytery joyned in the
common Government of the Church.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61567:46"/>
Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> plainly shews how easily the
ancient form of Government may be
revived again, and with what little shew
of alteration, namely, by erecting a
Suffragan Bishop in every rural Deane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
into which every Diocess is subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
who may every moneth assemble
a Synod of all the incumbent Pastors
within the Precinct, and according to the
major part of voices, conclude all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that should be brought into debate
before them, yet with a liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
(if need require) to the Diocesan,
Provincial, National Synods. That the
number of Bishops should be very much
augmented doth evidently appear to all
that know and consider the weight of
Episcopal Superintendency; and the
learned Bishop now mentioned gives a
hint, that their number might be very
well conformed to the number of rural
Deaneries. Surely so many hundred
populous Parishes now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of one Bishop might be well
divided into many Diocesses ample e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
And such a course would make
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61567:46"/>
not only for the edifying of the Church
by the more effectual inspection of many
Bishops for one, but also for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning by the multiplication
of preferments. Wherefore nothing of
the Churches being or well-being, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Divine Institution or primitive
practise doth withstand the reduction of
Prelacy to moderate Episcopacy, or the
ancient Synodical government, to which
the Presbyterians may conform without
repugnancy to their principles.</p>

                     <p>The point of Ceremonies comes next
under debate. And for as much as it
concerns Divine Worship, it is of high
importance, and a tender point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And herein we affirm, that the
Presbyterian concessions are no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
but sufficient and ample unto all
regular devotion in divine Service. All
natural expressions of devotion, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
external worship they readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
as kneeling and lifting up
of the hands and eyes in prayer, and such
like; which are called natural, because
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61567:47"/>
nature it self teacheth all Nations to use
them without any divine or humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and a rational man by the meer
light of nature is directed to them, yet
not without some government of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and discretion: For in these things
nature is in part determined and limited
by the custome of several Ages and
Countries, and by the difference of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Cases. In the act of adoration
the prostration of the body is used ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to nature in some ages, places,
and occasions, and not in others. In
ancient times the wearing of fackcloth
and ashes, and renting of clothes, were
fit expressions of humiliation, and that
according to nature; yet the same suits
not with our times: For herein nature is
subject unto some variety; and now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
the wearing of the meanest apparel
were sutable in a day of Humiliation,
because it is now a convenient natural
expression of self-abasement, and a kind
of abstinence. Likewise kneeling is a
natural prayer-posture; but where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be used conveniently, standing is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61567:47"/>
agreeable; nevertheless neither
the one nor the other is necessary, where
infirmity or other necessity makes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
Moreover they do not scruple
the meer circumstances of order, as time,
place, and method, without which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions cannot be performed. They
allow and commend all matters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
as decent Churches or meeting
places, and furniture, as a Pulpit Cloth,
Communion Cup, and a grave habit for
a Minister, and in holy duties a grave po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of body &amp; composed countenance,
and the wearing of the best apparel upon
solemn sacred times; all which are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in the general Rule, <hi>Let all things
be done decently and in order:</hi> Which Rule
properly is of the Law of nature, and
would oblige Christians, though it had
not been written in the holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>In the things before mentioned we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a good accord; but here lies the
difference.</p>
                     <p>The Presbyterians stick at Ceremonies
properly sacred, and significant by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
institution, which they conceive to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61567:48"/>
be more than meer circumstances, even
parts of Worship; and whatsoever insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Worship is not ordained of God
they hold unlawful. To the making up
of the Ceremonies now in question, they
observe these things; Humane Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
mystical and instituted, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
signification, and appropriation to
divine Worship. And it alters not the
case, that they are by nature apt to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
(for so are all Sacraments) if they
do not actually signifie without institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That such Ceremonies are parts of
divine Worship, they prove from the
nature of Worship in general, which
requires no more, then that it hath the
honour of God for its direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
end; it is something not reductive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but directly sacred and religious, and
an immediate expression of our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of God, and obligation to him.
And such is the nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
Ceremonies, much differing
from matters of order and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which properly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
respect men that use them, as the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61567:48"/>
Church or Temple is immediately and
directly for the assembling of people, a
Communion Cup for drinking, a Table
cloth for covering. Decency is no part
of Worship, but a circumstance thereof
not proper to it, but common, with grave
civil actions; and doth no more become
sacred, when applyed to sacred uses, than
a sacred thing (as prayer) becomes civil,
when applyed to civil uses. Time consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a meer circumstance of a sacred
action, belongs to it not precisely as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
but as an action, because without
time no action can be performed. And
being a meer circumstance, it needs not
be determined of God, but is left to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prudence according to occasion,
whether for private or publick Worship;
which is the case of time for private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and dayes of publick Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Thanksgiving. But they that
scruple our mystical significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
conceive that they are properly
and meerly sacred, as having the honour
of God for their direct and immediate
end, That the Surplice is not for gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61567:49"/>
nor meerly for decent distinction, but
a religious mystical habit, the character
or badge of a sacred Office, or Service
conformable to the linen Ephod under
the Law. The signing with the signe of
the Cross (they conceive) is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
sacred than the former. As Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
consecrates the Child, so doth the
Cross. It is used as a sealing sign of our
Obligation to Christ, as the words used
in the application thereof do manifest;
and the book of Canons doth declare
expresly, which saith. [<hi>That it is an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
hadge, whereby the Infant is dedicated
to the service of him that died on the Cross,
as by the words used in the Book of Common
Prayer it may appear.</hi>] And therefore it is
in that respect Sacramental. Besides,
if it were not a sealing sign, but only
for mystical teaching, it hath the same
nature with divers Levitical Ceremonies,
which were not typical, but doctrinal,
teaching some Moral Duty. A holy day,
or time properly sacred, whether by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
institution, as the <hi>Lords day,</hi> or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
as other sacred Festivals, is not a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61567:49"/>
meer circumstance, but a part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
For it is not only belonging to a
sacred action, as an action, but precisely
as a sacred action on that day to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
yea, it is of it self sacred, and
is not only sanctified by the Service, but
also sanctifieth the Service. The truth
is, sacred Ceremonies may in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
be called circumstances, as being
inferiour things subservient to Moral
Worship, which is the main; yet they
are also parts of Worship in general, for
Worship is either Moral or Ceremonial;
and that Ceremonial Worship which is
commanded of God is lawful and good;
but that which is not commanded by him
is neither good nor lawful, nevertheless
it is Worship. On this manner the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
this Controversie, and argue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That humane discretion is the rule
of Order and Method; Nature and civil
Custom is the rule of Decency, but
only Scripture is the rule of instituted
Worship, wherein both addition and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
is alike forbidden. It the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61567:50"/>
                        <hi>English</hi> Ceremonies be warrantably
used, what hinders the use of divers
other Ceremonies used in the Roman
Church? Is it said their multitude will
become burthensom and inconvenient?
But who can determine the convenient
number? And however, an exchange of
one Ceremony for another were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
For what reason may not some
other Romish Rites in Baptism be used as
well as the Cross, seeing they are nothing
less significant or inoffensive, nay perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
much more inoffensive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Papists by giving divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to the Cross have abused it to gross
Idolatry. We take this to be sound
speech or discourse, that cannot be gain-said.
And surely those of temperate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that are otherwise minded, might
well conceive that it hath such probable
appearance, as might possibly take with
learned and pious men. And seeing the
one Side allow and commend all natural
external Worship, and all matters of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and Order, and desire to be spared
in mystical Ceremonies of humane insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61567:50"/>
the other Side should not in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or charity insist on the said Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
as the terms of Church communion
and priviledges, and or Christian unity
and amity.</p>

                     <p>As concerning the Liturgy, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
do not gain-say the lawfulness
of a stinted form of Prayer, in as much
as the observing either of a Form or a
Directory is not of the substance of
prayer, but an accident or circumstance
belonging to it, and left to humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.
It is further granted by
them, that in some parts of publick
worship a form is ordinarily necessary;
as in the Sacramental actions, in the act
of Baptizing, and of consecrating and
delivering the Lords Supper. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
will be no dis-harmony, because they
are Scripture forms. Likewise in such
parts of Divine Service where it is not
necessary, they can submit unto it for the
Churches peace: Nevertheless they are
not satisfied in the present Liturgy, but
desire it may be laid aside, or much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61567:51"/>
And what solid reason with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the equity of this desire? Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Prelatists have acknowledged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
imperfections in the Book of
Common-Prayer, and Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>
hath collected sundry particulars in his
direction concerning the same presented
to the House of Commons upon their
request. Let sober judgments consider,
whether this or that form of prayer be
of the substance of that sacred exercise,
or only its outward shape and dress. If
it were of the substance of Religious
Worship, it would require Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
to make it lawful, as do other
parts of instituted Worship. If it be only
an outward shape and dress left to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prudence, it is variable according
to the difference of times. Whosoever
observes impartially shall find that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Prudence was joyned with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Piety in composing the English
Service Book. In the beginning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
the wisdom of the State so
ordered, that so great a change might be
made with as little noise as was possible,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61567:51"/>
and with regard to what the Nation
would bear. Accordingly when a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
was raised in <hi>Coruwal,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi>
about the change of Religion,
King <hi>Edward</hi> to appease the matter told
the people, That it was no other then
the old Service in the English Tongue.
Likewise when this form was revived
by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> one might conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
that care was taken, that no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
offensive, even to the Papists, might
remain therein; for we find an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Letany very material. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
King <hi>Edwards</hi> books ran thus, [<hi>From
all sedition and privy conspiracy, from the
tyranny of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all his
detestable enormities, from all false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Heresie.</hi>] These words [<hi>From
the tyranny of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all
his detestable enormities</hi>] were left out in
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and ever since.
Whereupon the Papists throughout this
Kingdom resorted to our Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for the first ten years of that Queens
Reign. And this came to pass also by
the Popes connivance, who was not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61567:52"/>
then in despaire of reducing <hi>England</hi> by
fair means. But sithence Papists have
been Recusants. Wherefore if forms be
variable, according to the difference of
times, and the present Liturgy was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
with respect to the peace of former
times, and the reconciling of Papists to
Protestants, but is now become by
change of times, an occasion of dividing
Protestants from each other, without
hope of regaining Papists: Can Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Reason plead for the rigorous
imposing of it (especially without very
much emendation) upon godly peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ministers and people that daie not
use it throughout? Doth the Life and
Soul of Religion lye in the Common-Prayer?
Is it as ancient as Christianity,
yea, or of equal extent with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Reformation? Whence is it then
that many will have no communion
with those that do not use it, or would
cast out of the Church those that cannot
use it throughout, who nevertheless in
all necessary parts of worship are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to Protestant Doctrine and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61567:52"/>
practice? Is that efficacy or excellency
in it, that the laying it aside would much
impair and weaken Religion, and darken
its glory? Let it be then examined,
whether it hath made the comers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
more perfect then others, more
knowing in Religion, more pious and
blameless in their conversation then
those that frequent it not. Let experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
come forth and witness; which (if
constant and universal) is the best proof
of the efficacy or imbecillity of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
Suppose a Liturgy were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of Confessions, Petitions, and
Thanksgivings, wholly collected out of
Sacred Scripture, both for matter and
expressions, would it be inferiour to that
which is now in question? Doubtless
such a form would be a happy expedient
to put an end to this controversie.</p>

                     <p>Canonical subscription lately imposed
is a yoke of bondage, to be considered
by all those that have a true regard to
such liberty in Religion, as equity and
necessity pleads for, Blessed be God
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61567:53"/>
who hath put it into the Kings heart to
extend compassion to a multitude of his
faithful Subjects, and to remove this
yoke; let not this or the like be laid on
their necks any more. The Canon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a subscribing to the thirty nine
Articles, to the Common-Prayer Book,
to the book of ordering Bishops, Priests
and Deacons; that all these contain in
them nothing contrary to the Word of
God. This is unreasonable, unprofitable,
and unnecessary. It is unreasonable; for
were it just and reasonable, it must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not only perfect verity throughout
the whole, without any mixture of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
but also either a spirit of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the composers of those books, or
the like measure of judgment and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
in all Orthodox and pious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
concerning all particulars in so
large a volume, written by men subject to
error. That there is not perfect Verity
without mixture, or grounded suspition
of error, there is real evidence. To as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
a spirit of infallibility in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
thereof, is not consonant to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61567:53"/>
principles. To suppose the like
measure of faith and judgement in all
Orthodox godly Ministers concerning
fallible writings is absurd; and to rack
men unto it, is an imitation of that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that would stretch miserable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
unto the length of that bed of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon which he laid them It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
unprofitable: For these forced large
subscriptions are known to be no sure
hold-fast of the multitude drawn into
them, whereof many come hand over
head, meerly as to an injoyned form; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more considerate do it in their own
sence. And indeed the best service
which this Injunction doth, is to lye as
a bar to exclude the more deliberate
sort, or as a clog to oppress their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
If to remedy this evil you allow
men to use their own limitations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations,
the business it self is insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.
It to satisfie several parties, you pen
the Doctrines and Forms in ambiguous
tearms, the swaying part of the Church
will draw them to their own peculiar
sence, and establish their own opinions,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61567:54"/>
to the crushing of dissenters; as by the
potency of some Prelates, Arminianism
was asserted for the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, it is unnecessary, for we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the benefits pretended by it are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Doctrine &amp; uniformity in Practice;
both which may be as well attained and
far more kindely, without this enforced
Subscription, if no Minister be suffered
to preach or write any thing contrary to
the established Doctrine, Worship, and
Discipline, nor ordinarily for the main
to neglect the established Rule. But what
inconvenience, if in things of lesser
weight, a latitude were allowed? A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
variety indulged in some particles, is
no impeachment of Uniformity, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an establishment thereof with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and tranquility. Contrariwise,
as the wringing of the Nose draws forth
blood; so over-straining and rigid injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
distemper the mindes of men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
peaceable, and stir up strife.</p>

                     <p>Moreover, the publick state of these
differences is such, that the Prelatists may
and ought to descend to the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the proposed moderate way; but
the Presbyterians cannot come up to the
Prelatists in the height of their way. For
the Prelates condescention stands only in
omission or forbearance of certain things
which seem to them lawful and laudable,
but the subjection of the Presbyterians
stands in subscribing and conforming to
certain things which to them seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:
And common equity will soon
pass its verdict, that the condescention of
the one is far more easie then the subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the other. Bishop <hi>Davenant</hi> in his
<hi>Determinations</hi> resolves in one question,
that a Protestant may not with a safe
conscience be present at the Popish Mass,
because he wounds his conscience by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
dissimulation, thereby making a
shew of approving that pretended expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
sacrifice. In another Question he
resolves, That Papists are bound to be
present at the English Divine Service,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61567:55"/>
because nothing occurs therein, that can
be by themselves reproved. In applying
this to our case, it is far from my thoughts
to make the comparison between <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
and <hi>Prelatists</hi> parallel with that
between <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists;</hi> but I
make the reason of both cases parallel:
for as <hi>Papists</hi> find nothing in the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
Liturgy (according to their own
principles) impious or unsound; in like
manner the <hi>Prelatists</hi> can find no positive
thing in the propounded terms of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
contrary to divine right and
primitive practice; only as the <hi>Papists</hi>
find not so much as they would have in
our Liturgy, so the <hi>Prelatists</hi> in the said
proposals: Nay, the <hi>Papists</hi> have better
colour of reason to separate from our
publique Service, because, although they
find nothing positively unsound, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Roman Faith they may
pretend fundamental defects therein; as
the want of the sacrifice of the Mass: but
the <hi>Prelatists</hi> can here alledge no such
thing; the supposed defects and omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being only in things remote from the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61567:55"/>
foundation of Faith and Religion. For
we trust the greater number of them do
not hold, that there is no Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Prelate</hi> having sole jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Clergy; That there is no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
but what is ordained by such a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi>
That there is no true divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
where the Common-Prayer Book
is not used; and that there is no accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
worship, without humane mystical
Ceremonies. Let them that have taken
up such opinions sadly consider whether
they are led therein by conscience, or by
humour and designe.</p>

                  <div n="28" type="section">
                     <head>Section XXVIII.</head>
                     <p>The greatest shew of reason opposing
this moderation is a pretended fixation in
Religion; and indeed it is but a shew and
colour. That Religion is a thing unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
all that be truly religious do from
the heart acknowledge; and for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobility
thereof, none contend more
earnestly then the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> But
they fix its unmovable state in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Scripture, and they continually
cry to the Law and to the Testimony, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61567:56"/>
humane Traditions and Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in one Extream, and against Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasms
in the other. Upon occasion of
any aberration in Doctrine or practice
they recall us to the primitive rule and
pattern; and what is received from the
Lord, that deliver they to the Churches.
That sacred Rule they willingly suffer
not to be captivated in its interpretation
by the Churches infallibility, as do the
Papists; nor by proud and arrogant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as the Socinians; nor by impulse and
imagination, as the Euthusiasts: but they
maintain it in its full authority to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it self, whose authentick interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we are inabled to discern by ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
inferences and deductions, wherein
we make use of reason not as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but as instrument.</p>
                     <p>As for the Decrees and Canons
of the Church, what rightful Authority
doth make them as the Law of the Medes
and Persians that altereth not? Must
things be enacted by the Church once
and for ever? And whether they be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or great, clear or doubtful, necessary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61567:56"/>
or superfluous, must they be held unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
and indisputable? Surely this
is to Idolize humane Constitutions, and
to equalize them with Divine; and to
lead the people to a blind implicite faith,
and a neglect of searching the Scriptures.
And upon this ground those large Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as the Roman, Grecian, Aethiopick,
Armenian, Indian, and the rest, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
divided for many ages from
each other, and holding to this principle
of unalterable Traditions and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they will be divided to the end of
the world. Had not all Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Decrees a beginning, and that
at sundry times, and in divers manners?
And are not many of them as it were but
of yesterday? And when they were
brought in, where was the pretended fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?
Doubtless Religion may be alike
altered by Addition as by Substraction.
Nay, Hath there not been Substraction
also? Are not divers Customs and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of great antiquity now quite
abolished among us? If the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> may erre, why not the Church of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61567:57"/>
                        <hi>England?</hi> Indeed the <hi>Papists</hi> that hold
their Church infallible, may hold the
Decrees thereof unalterable, but the
Church of <hi>England</hi> claims no such privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Was it necessary that our first
Reformers should see all things at the
first day-break out of the night of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Or if they saw all things requisite
for their own times, could they foresee
all future events, and provide remedies
for inconveniencies which time might
bring forth. It is a wise saying of a
learned man, <hi>That time it self is the
greatest Innovator;</hi> and again, <hi>That Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
is an Innovation.</hi> Surely as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
so the body politick, sometimes
needs physick, and oftentimes moderate
Reformations do prevent abolitions and
extirpations. Besides, a great alteration
in this kind hath continued in a stated po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
for many years, which inferres a
greater necessity of an accommodation.
Nevertheless there is no attempt or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
made of changing any thing, that
toucheth sound faith, and good life, or
the substance of divine worship. Yet
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61567:57"/>
in the Doctrine of the Church somthing
possibly may have been inserted as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith, which is but problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
and in a fundamental Article some
inconvenient expression may be used, and
this questionless may be altered without
any imputation of uncertainty to the
established Doctrine. Some change in
the outward Form and Ceremonies,
which are but a garb or dress, is no real
change of the Worship: some change
in the late external jurisdiction of the
Church, which was not formally Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
and spiritual, but temporal and
coercive, invested in the Bishops by the
Law of the Land, is no change in the
true spiritual power, that is intrinsecal
to their spiritual office. Nay, the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
may be encompassed with little
variation, as to the outward model and
platform, the Kingdom being already
squared for it, as hath been above shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the offers made by some Bishops.
Only the power will be more diffused,
being distributed among Bishops and
Presbyters in due proportion. Is it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61567:58"/>
once remove the ancient bounds,
and we know not where to stop, we must
serve every humour, and an inundation
of errour and Schism will break in?
Surely Papists have as much to say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
against the Protestants, as the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
against the Presbyterians. For
they say, that Protestantism is the womb
of all Sects, and that we having forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the infallible Guide, the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> have lost our selves in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of errour: besides, who were they
that removed the ancient bounds set in
the first English Reformation, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
many innovations? but to give a
direct answer, are not the sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and Christs holy Institutions,
sufficient bounds and land-marks? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prudent and faithful Church-guides
keep the flock from wandring, unless
they hedge them in by unchangeable
Canons, even for meer formalities? In
the late distempered times, the Sectaries
and masked Jesuites had a free rainge,
and all possible advantages, yet it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that towards the later end, errour
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61567:58"/>
was rather in the wane then in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
which we are bold to attribute
to the liberty of constant practical
preaching. Wherefore settle discipline,
incourage true Watchmen, restrain se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,
expel the Jesuites, and the
Church through Gods blessing will be
kept in peace and order.</p>

                     <p>If these things are so, whence proceeds
the present vehemence and importunity
of so many of the Episcopal party, to
carry things to the height of their way,
without the least abatement of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
rigour. Some of that way, as wise
and learned, and pious, as many among
them, did offer terms in the time of their
distraction and distress; and in those
times it was a common thing among the
friends of Prelacy, to condemn the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of some of the late Prelates.
Have present advantages made them of
another minde? If they answer by retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Why did not the Presbyterians
make a more early offer of agreement,
and close, when time was, with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61567:59"/>
of some Bishops? Truely we are
willing to argue the case, and have many
things to reply. And first it is freely
acknowledged, that we ought to have
had a more tender respect to each other,
to have better considered the state of
<hi>England,</hi> and to have studied moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet let not one side bear all the
blame, when both are faulty. Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
actings on both sides suddenly
brought us to extremities, and a War
brake forth, and then both Prelatists
and Presbyterians were ingaged with
such partakers, that the more moderate
on both sides must needs be overacted.
And as the War was prolonged, the
breach was widened, Statesmen, and
Swordmen, and particular subdividing
interests having their peculiar and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
designs. Moreover, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Power, and the House of Peers were
suppressed, and most of the House of
Commons secluded, the Presbyterians
had only an interest of liberty, but not
of power, and authority, and favour.
You cannot impute to them the want
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61567:59"/>
of unity, which was not possible for
them to encompass. But they were
heartily weary of those confusions, and
longed for unity and order, and had
much regard to Bishop <hi>Ushers</hi> reduction
then reprinted, desiring to take it for a
ground-work, or beginning of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
among all sober Protestants,
that we might not be spoiled of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but what Papists and Sectaries
would by their leaves allow us. So that
not of constraint, but of choice and a
ready mind, they pursue peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
Howbeit, in those times some
Prelatists of the higher strain would
condescend in nothing, but gloried in
calling themselves the unchangeable
Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is,
in their sence, the unalterable Asserters
of the Opinions and practices of the late
English Hieratchy. There were also
many more moderate Episcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
that were formerly reckoned half
Puritans, and upon that account kept
from preferment, till about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Long Parliament, some of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61567:60"/>
them were made Bishops for the support
of Episcopacy. These being exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the late Wars, and the issue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
violent changes in Government, and
their own sufferings, which happened
beyond our first expectations, were set
at a greater distance from us. Let both
sides acknowledge their errour in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
unto such a distance from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
The truth is, men ingaged in
War aim at victory, and having peculiar
interests, draw to extreams. But now
we settle upon a common bottom; and
prudence should guide us to aim at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
satisfaction. It is known that some
Episcopal and Presbyterian Divines
have joyned hand in hand, and why
should not all those of either party do
the like, that are both for Christ? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a calamity may befall sound and
good Christians, to refuse unity in
Church-order, when the terms mutually
required seem to one or both parties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.
But in the present case, when
nothing is desired in contradiction to
Divine Right, Primitive practice, order
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61567:60"/>
and decency, but a forbearance or indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in things not of themselves neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
yet scrupled as unlawful, and it will
not be accepted, surely either secular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
or the everlasting enmity, is the
root of this dissention. And certainly,
with those that bear so hard upon mens
consciences, conformity to Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Rites and Ceremonies, is not
sufficient to procure their amity. We
well remember how heretofore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Puritanes were as great an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore
to some Prelates as the non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.
But in good earnest, shall such
precious things as the peace and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, the needful service
of so many able and godly Ministers,
and the quiet and comfort of so many
sober-minded Christians, be all sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Hierarchy and Ceremonies?
Will not Episcopal Protestant Divines
regard the weakning of the Protestant
Cause in Christendom, by treading the
Presbyterians under foot? The more
ancient Bishops in <hi>England</hi> were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
minde, as Bishop <hi>Robert Abbot</hi> by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61567:61"/>
name, witness this passage of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
preached, when he was Doctor of
the Chair in Oxford [<hi>That men under
pretence of truth, and preaching against
the Puritans, strike at the heart and root
of Faith and Religion now establisted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us; that this preaching against
Puritans was but the practice of</hi> Parsons
<hi>and</hi> Campians <hi>counsel when they came into</hi>
England <hi>to seduce young Students: and
when many of them were afraid to lose their
places, if they should professedly be thus,
the counsel they then gave them was, that
they should speak freely against Puritans,
and that should suffice.</hi>] Let our Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
brethren as Divines, as Protestants,
as Christians, consider these things. O
let it not be said of this Generation in the
time to come, that the way of peace we
have not known.</p>
                     <p>From the Discourse aforegoing, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
this pacifick and healing conclusion,
That the Party called <hi>Presbyterian</hi> may
be protected and incouraged, and the
<hi>Episcopal</hi> not deserted nor disobliged.

to the State of <hi>England,</hi> than the

the total subversion of the other?</p>

                     <p>That state of Prelacy which cannot
stand without the subversion of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
and that stands in opposition
to regulated Episcopacy, will become a
mystery of a meer carnal and worldly
state, under a sacred title and venerable
name of our Mother the Church. For
in such opposition, of what will it be
made up, but of Lordly revenue, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61567:62"/>
splendor, and jurisdiction, with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ease and pleasure? What will its
design be from age to age, but to uphold
and advance its own pomp and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
Read the Ecclesiastical Histories,
and you shall finde the great business of
the Hierarchy hath been to contest with
Princes and Nobles, and all ranks and
degrees, about their Immunities, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
Pre-eminencies, to multiply
Constitutions and Ceremonies for props
to their own Greatness, but not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Spiritual Kingdom of our
Lord Jesus Christ in the hearts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
according to the life and power
of Christianity. The above-named <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Gentleman, in his Narrative of the
Popes Nuncio, delivers this Maxime.
[<hi>That the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>in perpetual
pursuance of its old pretences, is more sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
and laborious to reverse and destroy
the Oath of Allegiance, because it seems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to its temporall grandeur, then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
such Heresies as the Realm of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>is infected with.</hi>] Even so such an
Hierarchy will be more industrious and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61567:62"/>
careful to establish and enlarge their own
Power &amp; Dignity, then to maintain and
propagate Christs true Religion. What
are the weapons of the Warfare, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
this Mystical State prevails? Not such
as are mighty through God, working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the conscience, but pecuniary Mulcts;
and greater temporal penalties; not to
the wounding of the spirit, but to the
breaking of the outward estate. By what
wayes and methods must it be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced?
The constant and practical preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word must be discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
Snares must be laid for the most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Ministers, Sports and pastimes on
the Sabbath dayes must be held forth
with allowance and approbation, Men
of strict lives and serious in Religion
must be reproached for Fanaticks. By
these means a people being first enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to ignorance, superstition and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
will be disposed unto blinde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and perfect spiritual bondage. For
in very deed, the State here described
will never stand safely among a people
that are free, serious, searching and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61567:63"/>
in matters of Religion.</p>
                     <p>For this cause an Hierarchy of this
nature hath a strong bias towards Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Nay, it must for its own safety ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
as near it as the Nation can well
bear. The Reformed Religion doth not
glory in the vast riches, outward pomp
and splendour of Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Wherefore, when the grandeur of
Prelates and pomp of Ceremonies is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
and admired, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
is sure to finde favour in the eyes of the
Clergy. The said <hi>Venetian</hi> reports
[<hi>That the Universities, Bishops and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of this Realm dayly imbrace Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Opinions, though they profess them not
with open mouth, for fear of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>]
In this matter let them stand or
fall by the evidence of their own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
Let it be well observed, that the
designes of suppressing Puritans, and
complying with Papists in this Nation,
had their beginning both at once, and
proceeded in equal paces. And it hath
appeared, that the moderate <hi>Cassandrian
Grotian</hi> Popery was no abomination
to many Prelatists.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:61567:63"/>
The Conciliators of our age have
judged Papists and moderate Protestants
(as they call them) very reconcileable,
but have cast the <hi>Calvinists</hi> or <hi>Puritans</hi>
without the limits of the pacification.
Wherefore, we cannot conceive that the
excessive height of Prelacy (I say not
this of regulated Episcopacy) to be the
strongest Bulwark against Popery,
unless by Popery is meant no more
then what the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers (except the
<hi>Italians</hi>) generally opposed, to wit, the
stupendious exorbitant power of the
Pope, who pretends to be not only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
but in effect, sole Bishop of the
Universe, as reputing all other Bishops
his meer subjects and delegates. We
confess, Popery in this new and strict
notion, might be controlled by the height
of <hi>Prelacy.</hi> But, according to a vulgar
sence, we take Popery in the height there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
for the Heresies and Idolatries; and
in the lower degree thereof, for the gross
errors and superstitions of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Moreover, pure necessity in that
state will constrain the Hierarchy to
negotiate with <hi>Rome,</hi> if they subvert and
ruine the Presbyterians. If in such a
case they intend to uphold a Protestant
State, they understand not their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
The Bishops must either
retreat to a moderate compliance with
Presbyteriaus, or advance to a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
with Papists. If they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to extirpate the Presbyterians, and
could accomplish it, are they able after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
alone and by themselves to bear
up against the main force, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all the wiles and methods of the
popish Faction at home and abroad?
They mistake themselves, if they think
their unalterable adherents are so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and powerful, In case they dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
that other party, which hath been
always found most active, vigorous, and
vigilant against Romish Encroachments,
what remains, besides themselves and
their zealots, but a common dronish
multitude, that will do little for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61567:64"/>
or men of loose principles, that
would easily embrace <hi>Popery</hi> as a flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
Religion. When the common
people are left to ignorance and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for servile ends and purposes, they
are thoroughly prepared for Popery,
which is a gross, sensual, formal, pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
way, agreeable to the multitude;
whereas Fanaticism, the other extreme,
takes but with a few in comparison, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath something of pretended il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations,
spiritual notions and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
to which the common multitude
is not propense. If you ask how hath
<hi>Prelacy</hi> held it out hitherto against <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
even from the first Reformation;
take notice that the Episcopal Clergy
did not go about to exterminate the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
before their latter times, and then
he that had half an eye could discern the
notable advance, and the confident expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
of the Popish faction.</p>

should favour the Oath of Allegiance.
And the reason hereof is evident, because
it is a thing contrary to the maxims of

of the said Nuncio there is a passage,
which being well considered doth evince
that the Courts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> are
irreconcileable, unless <hi>England</hi> become
intirely papal. That Author saith [<hi>That
this Realm is so perversly addicted to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
its own resolute opinion of excluding
the Popes authority, that this hath been the
cause why the Catholicks, who for the first
twelve years conformed themselves unto the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61567:65"/>
Politie introduced into the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>have since separated from it; and to

Let a fair accord in the general be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
yet the sole point of the <hi>Popes</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
shal dash the whole agreement.
We know that Jesuitism is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
humour in the Papacy, and nothing
can be done without their influence; and
therefore we cannot be one with the

as to reason of State, Enmity with <hi>Rome</hi>

concerning which the Duke of
<hi>Rhoan</hi> hath delivered this Maxime,
[<hi>That besides the Interest which the King of</hi>

he hath yet one particular, which is, that he
ought thoroughly to acquire the advancement
of the Protestant Religion, even with as
much zeal as the King of</hi> Spain <hi>appears
Protector of the Catholick.</hi>] Indeed, that
Scarlet-coloured Whore hath this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
ingredient in the cup of her
Fornication, that she disposeth Subjects
to security and blind obedience, and
exalteth Princes unto absolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But against this poison a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Antidote is given by a judicious
Writer, that this proves that subjects are
more miserable, not that Princes are
more absolute among <hi>Papists;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as where the <hi>Pope</hi> prevails, there
is a co-domination and rivalty in rule,
and this <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes are freed

from: and whereas Popery hath been
ever infamous for excommunicating,
murthering, deposing Princes, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi>
Religion aims at nothing but that
the Kings Prerogative and popular Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
may be even balanced. If it be
said, that this is true of <hi>Protestantism,</hi>
but <hi>Puritanism</hi> leads to sedition, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iion,
Anarchy; let the world know,
that <hi>Puritanism</hi> (which is no other than

                     <p>From the reasons aforegoing we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That <hi>Protestantism</hi> will best
consist in the middle way, by reducing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61567:67"/>
Prelacy to the ancient synodical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or moderate Episcopacy. And this
is a blessed work, worthy of a pacifick
King, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> respect to his honor &amp; service,
whose title is <hi>The Prince of Peace.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Majesty (with Gods help) may
over-rule without difficulty or hazzard.
He need not say of those that are averse
(as <hi>David</hi> sometimes did of the sons of
<hi>Zerviah) That they are too hard for him.</hi>
Prelacy is not popular, but moderate
Episcopacy is, and the more, because it
is a healing expedient for our broken
times. The Bishops depend intirely on
the King, but he hath no dependance on
them, no need of advantage from them.
What if some interessed persons be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented?
The sober of the Nation
(both Episcopal and Presbyterian) will
have great contentment in the King's
prudence and moderation. His Majesty
is a Prince by Nature. He is our Native
King, and the delight of the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and may govern as he please, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear or hazard, by continuing to
shew himself a common Father. For
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61567:67"/>
there is none other upon whom the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of <hi>England</hi> can bottom it self, but
our gracious dread Soveraign King
<hi>Charles;</hi> whose House and Kingdom let
the most High establish throughout all

sober principles earnestly waiting upon
him, longing and panting after his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and rejoycing in the begun ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

that they wished He were both
King, Lords, and Commons, as to the
setling of this grand Affair.</p>

                     <p>The excessive dominion of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
with the rigorous imposition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Ceremonies, was accounted much
of the malady of former times, which

Body of the Nation combined in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Faith, and substance of Divine
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61567:68"/>
worship according to God's holy Word.
But if the Church be taken in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
sence for the Clergy or Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet so the Hierarchy is not the Church
either formally or virtually. When as
according to <hi>Camdens</hi> report, there are

                     <p>And can the self-same state and frame
of Ecclesiasticks be now revived after so
great and long continued alterations, by
which the anti-prelatical party is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
encreased and strengthened?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Machiavel,</hi> whose reason in things
political may challenge regard, gives
these two directions to a Prince to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
observed for securing his hereditary
Dominions: First, that he doth not
transgress the institutions of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors:
Secondly, That he serve the time
according to new occasions; by which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61567:68"/>
if a Prince be inducd with ordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in action, he will preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his principality. His Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to the exercise of his Kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
after a long interruption in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and great alteration in the State,
Civil and Ecclesiastical. And he hath
this happy advantage presenting it self to
his hand, that he may give general satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
by retaining the ancient Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Government, with some necessary
variation conformable to these times, in
abating the excess of former things, and
qualifying the same with some tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ingredients. Certainly it concerns
an hereditary Prince, as to maintain the
ancient constitutions, so to redress anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
grievances, and to cure inveterate
maladies. The party dissatisfied in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
things, were not a company of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
Mutineers, but a Parliament of
judicious and consciencious persons, and
their adherents, who for the major part
never intended to dissolve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but have to their power endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

                     <p>Moreover, this dissatisfaction in the
old frame of the Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not a novelty of these times, as
appears by those prudent considerations
touching the better pacification and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Church, presented to
King <hi>James</hi> by that most learned Lord
<hi>Verulam,</hi> sometimes Lord Chancellour
of <hi>England,</hi> who was no <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
nor enemy to Episcopacy, in which are
these passages.</p>
                     <p>There be two circumstances in the
administration of Bishops, wherein I
confess I could never be satisfied. The
one, the sole Exercise of their Authority,
the other, the Deputation of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For the first, the Bishop giveth
orders alone, excommunicateth alone,
judgeth alone. This seems to be a
thing almost without example in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and therefore not unlikely to
have crept in in the degenerate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61567:69"/>
times. We see the greatest Kings
and Monarchs have their Councels.
There is no Temporal Councel in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
of the higher sort, where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
doth rest in one person. Again
he saith, Bishops have their infirmities,
and have no exception from that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
malediction which is pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all men living, <hi>Vaesoli, &amp;c.</hi> Nay,
we see the first warrant in spiritual causes
is directed to a number, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi>
which is not so in temporal matters. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
we see that the Bishop of <hi>Rome (fas
est &amp; ab hoste doceri,</hi> and no question in
that Church the first Institutions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent)
performeth all Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction as in Consistory; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
consisteth this Consistory, but of the
Parish Priests of <hi>Rome,</hi> which term them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Cardinals, <hi>à Cardinibus Mundi,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Bishop thereof pretendeth to
be universal over the whole world.
Touching the second point, the deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Authority, he saith, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
exerciseth his Jurisdiction by his

offices of confidence and skill cannot be
put over, nor exercised by Deputy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be especially contained in the
Original Grant, and then it becomes
dutiful. There was never any Judge
that made a Deputy. The Bishop is
a Judge, and of an high nature: whence
cometh it that he should depute, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all trust and confidence is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
and inherent, and cannot, or ought
not to be transposed? Surely in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>ab initio non fuit ita.</hi> But it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that Bishops when they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
too much to the glory of the
world, and became Grandees in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and great Councellors to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
then did they deleague their proper
Jurisdiction, as things of too inferiour a
nature for their greatness; and then after
the similitude of Kings and Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
they would have their Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and Judges.</p>

Yea, our late Soveraign in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
touching the differences between
himself and the two Houses, in point of
Church-Government, declares in these
words, that he is not against the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the Episcopal presidency in one
man, by the joynt counsel and consent
of many <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but that he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to restore it, as a fit means to avoid
those errours, and corruptions, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities,
which are incident to any one
man; also to avoid Tyranny, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
no Christians, least of all Church-men:
besides, it will be a means to take
away that odium and burden of affairs
which may lye too heavy on one mans
shoulders, as he thought it did formerly
on the Bishops here.</p>

                     <p>By the desired reduction of <hi>Prelacy,</hi>
to the coalition of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
in a due temperament, His Majesty
will be so far from giving up, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that power and influence, which
in right and reason he ought to have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61567:71"/>
over Church and State, that he will
thereby gain a surer and a larger interest.
Bishops lessened in power, and encreased
in number, and resident in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and duly dispencing the Word and
Sacraments, are not like to alienate the
King from Parliaments, nor Parliaments
and people from the King, but will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more popular, and able to fix the
hearts of the people to obedience and
loyalty. And this popularity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Presbyters, being alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
potency, is no rational ground of
distrust or jealousie to the King. For
their influence upon others will not be
from greatness of power and command,
but from venerable esteem and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that stands upon their prudent,
pious, and peaceable behaviour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
his Majesty can easily keep them
in such dependence on himself, as that
he shall not hold this interest at their
courtesie. Do any suggest the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
may grow upon him? Surely there
are and will be enough to balance them,
Certainly they have seen so little good
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61567:71"/>
of changes, that a reasonable condition,
with security, will be acceptable to
them. Undoubtedly the union of both
parties, by an equal accommodation, is
the interest of Prince and people, the
strength and stability of King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Let neither side lay hold on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
mutable advantages to press them
too far; but let all consider what will
stand with lasting tranquillity. And
above all, let his Majesties wisdom, who
hath the high concernment of three
Kingdoms for himself and his Heirs for
ever, lay a good and solid foundation for
the time to come.</p>

That in these Discourses
I do not mention parties to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Division, but to procure Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
That necessity compels me to
use those names of difference,
which I heartily wish might be no
more remembred: But whilst disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
Parties last, names of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
cannot cease, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
their use is to little purpose.
My business is to take things as I
find them, and to state the Case
between the Dissenters, and to shew
how far they agree, and how little
they differ, for this end, That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Moreover, as I use not the name
of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the way of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
so I use not the name of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
or <hi>Prelatist</hi> in way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
but meerly for distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sake; and I have warrant for
it from the friends of <hi>Prelacy,</hi>
with whom it is not unusual to
mention the name of <hi>Prelate</hi> in an
honourable Sence.</p>

                  <p>THe former Treatise of <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of</hi> England <hi>in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the way of peace, in the reconciling
of those two grand Parties, the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal</hi>
and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> which, if made
one, would take in, and carry along
the strength of almost the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The whole structure thereof
rests upon these Positions as its ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Foundation.</p>
                  <p>That whilst the two forenamed Parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
divided, both the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>
is divided against it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61567:75"/>
That the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> cannot be rooted
out, nor their Interest swallowed up,
whilest the State of <hi>England</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Protestant.</p>
                  <p>That their subversion, if it be possible to
be accomplished, will be very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Protestant Religion, and the
Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Coalition of both Parties into
one may be effected by an equal accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
without repugnancy to their
conscientious Principles on either side,
in so much that nothing justifiable by
Religion or sound Reason can put a
bar to this desirable Union.</p>
                  <p>Now for as much as political mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are involved in difficulties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
by variety of complicated
concernments, all which should be
thorowly seen, and diligently examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and compared; and because the
minds of men are commonly pre-inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61567:75"/>
or at least much byassed in these
matters, and thereupon are not easily
removed from their pre-conceived o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
I could not rest satisfied, as
having done my part in this healing
Work, unless besides a firm and clear
proof of things in general, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
a deeper impression, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
perswasion, by searching on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every
side, by pressing up close to those
closest concernments and most obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
prejudices that oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and by opening the passages, and
making the way plain to this desired
Pacification.</p>

                     <p>It is a grave and weighty saying of
the Duke of Rohan,—<hi>Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the people; and Interest commands
the Princes. The knowledge of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is as much more raised above that
of Princes Actions, as they themselves
are above the People. A Prince may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
himself, the Councel may be corrupt,
but the Interest alone never faileth: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it is well or ill understood, it
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61567:76"/>
maketh States to live or dye.</hi>—Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this saying it is matter of life and
death political to the Kingdom of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
as it doth well or ill understand
its own Interest: In this deliberation
two Interests exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
offer themselves unto us. They
are distinct, yet not divided; but they
embrace each other, and they both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
belong to us, and are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
to be owned by us. The one is
Religious, the other Civil. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is that of the Protestant Religion,
and the latter is that of this Kingdom.
Wherefore in this Inquiry, the main
and fundamental point of knowledge
lies in discerning the true state of both.
Now the true state of any Society lies
in the Universality, or the whole Body,
not in any contracting or sub-dividing
part thereof: And the Interest lies in
the conversation and advancement of
the Universality.</p>

                  <div n="3" type="section">
                     <head>Section III.</head>
                     <p>Hereupon this question ariseth,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61567:76"/>
which is the great Case and Question
of the present times.</p>
                     <p>Whether we should assert the contracted
and dividing Interest of one Party, before
the general Interest of Protestantism, and
of the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in
which the <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Parties may be happily United.</p>
                     <p>Be it here observed, That such is the
joynt stock of both Parties in things of
greatest moment, that by declining
extreams on both hands, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion may be strengthened,
with Unity in Doctrine, Worship and
Discipline, among all its professors,
and the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> by an
inviolable Union between these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Parties may flourish in
peace and plenty: for those discords
that divide the members and distract
the whole body, will cease; and those
common concernments which tend to
uphold and encrease the Universality,
will be acknowledged and pursued.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="4" type="section">

                     <head>Section IV.</head>
                     <p>To turn aside from this common
Interest of the whole body, to those
inferiour partial ones, is to set up the
trade of Monopolizers, which inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
brings this mischief, that a few
grow rich by impoverishing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and this inconvenience
also to them that follow the trade, that
they grow rich upon the sudden, but
are not secure, because many are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and more excluded from sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the benefit. In the present case,
if the one Party be the only exalted
Ones, and the other trodden under
foot, the damage will redound to the
Protestant cause, and to the Church
and Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
some men think, this Church
and Kingdom is concerned in the one,
as well as in the other Party. In the
same case, though one side should rise
suddenly to a great height, yet their
Estate would be more secure and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if they held the way open and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to those of the other side, seeing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61567:77"/>
they are willing to close upon terms
just and reasonable.</p>

                     <p>Moreover, those Kingdoms, and
Common-wealths, and Societies of all
kinds, which are of the largest Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
are of the greatest potency.
Now a comprehensive Interest, that
takes in vast multitudes, is indeed a
large Foundation, and a Society that
builds upon it shall become great and
mighty; but a contracted Interest, that
draws all to a fewer number, is a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Foundation; and if it exclude
many that should be taken in, it is too
narrow for the Fabrick that should rest
upon it. As a large house cannot be
built upon a narrow foundation; so a
great Kingdom, (such as is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi>) and an ample Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
(such as is that of the Protestant
Religion,) cannot be built upon a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Interest.</p>
                     <p>Let it be considered, that the adverse
Kingdom, to wit, the Papacy, is ample
and powerfull: Should not the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61567:78"/>
Religion, and the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
aim at enlargement, and length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
their cords, to take within their line
all those that are intirely affected to
them? Then might they send forth
much more numerous Forces of able
Champions against the Armies of
Antichrist: So should this National
Church become <hi>terrible as an Army
with Banners.</hi>

which concern all Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the like case, there is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
peculiar to this Kingdom, or rather
to this Island of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> which

                     <p>I am not ignorant that designs of
Pacification between disagreeing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are liable to much suspition, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction,
and hard censure; that
the attempts of Reconcilers have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
proved fruitless, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
matter of disreputation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and no marvel that such cross
effects should commonly follow such
attempts; for sometimes they are made
to reconcile light and darkness, the
Temple of God and Idols. This was
the way of a Great One, even a Prince
in Learnings Empire, who would make
an accord between the <hi>Augustine</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and
also of a certain Romish Ecclesiastick,
who would make the like accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the said Council, and the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61567:79"/>
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than
which nothing could be more absurd

but a violent wresting of those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Articles to a forced sence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the propriety of language, and
the scope of the whole matter, and the
apparent judgement of both Parties;
and so it could never heal the breach;
For if both Parties were drawn to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the same forms of Confession,
but with meanings so far distant from
each other, as are the Doctrines of the
Protestant, and Roman Churches,
they would not really advance one step
the nearer to peace and concord.</p>

                     <p>Such designs as these sometimes
proceed from lukewarmness or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
in Religion, and an underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
of main Truths, together with a
contempt of godly Zeal, as a thing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
and impertinent. And
sometimes they proceed from vastness
of minde, whereby some through too
great a sense of their vast abilities, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61567:79"/>
to themselves a Dictatorship in
Religion, to approve or condemn, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or reject, according to their own
estimation of things; which is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
kind of ambition, and (as a
learned man speaks) is to take up the
Office of an Umpire between God and
men. But many times such a design
is set on foot with much craftiness, for
the undoing of one of the Parties, as it
hath been undertaken by some Romish
spirits, for the undermining of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches. A Divine of chief
rank observes the arts and stratagems
of some <hi>Popish</hi> Preachers, even of
those Orders that have been held most
implacable, whereby far otherwise
than the accustomed manner, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
the controversies, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that too much rigor hath been
used in some points, and in others too
little sincerity: yea, some Jesuits went
about making fair promises, yet in the
mean time abating no point of the chief
foundations of <hi>Papal</hi> Authority, which
standing firm, they knew that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61567:80"/>
Concessions granted for a time
might easily be drawn back, and the
opposite rigors imposed on those that
had been taken in the snare by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
yielding to some reformation.
<hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> (as the same Author
observes) being a most Pious and
Learned man, and zealous of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
peace, at first whilst he conceived
that some Reformation might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for from a General Council, was
free and forward in some points of yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Papists; but when he found
that such a benefit was neither hopefull
nor possible, he testified by his writings
how far distant he was from the aim of

                     <p>But the Pacification here propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is not by aggregating things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,
nor by devising mongrel ways
and opinions, made up out of both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
which can satisfie the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of neither Party; but by taking
out of the way such extreams on both
sides, as both may well spare and part
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61567:80"/>
with, being such as are acknowledged
no part of the Foundation, nor yet of
divine Institution, but mutable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to times and occasions, and
therefore cannot be of that importance
as to break unity amongst brethren,
that agree in the Doctrine of Faith, and
the substance of Divine Worship. This
desired Union is grounded upon the
Apostles Commandement, and the
pursuing thereof is no other then the
urging of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole fourteenth Chapter to
the Romans, That none judge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
another about things indifferent,
or Ceremonious Observances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as several men will abound in their
own sense, so it is meet that every one
be perswaded in his own minde concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his particular practice, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be done with a doubting consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
His MAJESTIES Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
hath rightly comprehended this
Matter in His Declaration touching
<hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs,</hi> wherein He saith,
—<hi>We are the rather induced to take
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61567:81"/>
this upon Us</hi> (that is, to give some deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the matters in difference)
<hi>by finding upon a full Conference that
We have had with the Learned men of
severall perswasions, that the mischiefs
under which both Church and State do at
present suffer, do not result from any form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctrine or Conclusion which either
Party maintains or avows, but from the
passion, and appetite, and Interest of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, which contract greater
prejudice to each other by those affections,
then would naturally arise from their
Opinions.</hi>—In old time there was a
partition wall of legal Ceremonies
and Ordinances raised up between
Jews and Gentiles; but when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of time was come, wherein God
would make both Jews and Gentiles
one in Christ, he was pleased to take
down that partition wall which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had reared up. In these latter times
there hath been a partition wal of mans
building, namely, controverted muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rites and forms of Religion, which
have kept asunder Christians of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61567:81"/>
same Nation, and of the same Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Protestant Profession: Both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and charity pleads for the removing
of these offences, that brethren may
dwell together in Unity. And to
transgress this rule of Charity, is not
only to lay a yoke upon the necks of
Christians, but also to lay snares for
their Consciences.</p>

                     <p>Nor will any defect in the State Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
insue upon the removal of
these matters in controversie: for the
points of Doctrine, Worship, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
acknowledged by both Parties,
are a sufficient and ample Foundation
for the edification and peace of the
Church to rest upon; for which we
cannot have a fuller Testimony than
what is given by His MAJESTY
in His aforesaid Declaration,—<hi>We
must for the Honour of all those of either
Perswasion, with whom we have conferred,
Declare, That the Professions and desires
of all for the advancement of Piety and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61567:82"/>
true Godliness are the same, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of Zeal for the Peace of the
Church the same, of affection and duty to
Us the same; they all approve Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
they all approve a set Form of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;
and they all disapprove and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the sin of Sacriledge, &amp; the alienation
of the revenue of the Church. And if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these excellent Foundations, in submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to which there is such an Harmony of
Affections, any Superstructure should be
raised to the shaking of these Foundations,
and to the contracting and lessening of the
blessed gift of Charity, which is a vital
part of Christian Religion, We shall
think Our Self very unfortunate, and
even suspect that We are defective in
that administration of Government with
which God hath entrusted Vs:</hi>—These
His Majesties Words I receive with
much veneration; for they are a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Sentence in the Mouth of the
King, and they fathom the depth of
this grand business.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore manifest, as from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so from His Majesties Testimony,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61567:82"/>
that those unhappy discords do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
from any formed Doctrine or
Conclusion, that either toucheth or
borders upon the Foundation; and that
excellent Foundations are contained in
those points, in submission to which
there is found such an Harmony of
Affections; and consequently, that
the laying aside of all the points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
would not cause any defect
in the State Ecclesiastical. What then
is the root of these mischiefs of Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Is it the perpetual hatred between
the seed of the Woman, and the seed
of the Serpent? or is it an uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and froward spirit of opposition,
by reason of irritated animosity, and
deep suspition or jealousie? or is it
some temporary carnal Design?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is first inquired,</hi> Whether the
root hereof be the perpetual ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
between the seed of the
Woman, and the seed of the
Serpent?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="11" type="section">

                     <head>Section XI.</head>
                     <p>Nothing is more certain from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and experience, then that a form of
the true Religion may be with a kind of
Zeal embraced, and the power thereof
hated and impugned by the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
The Scribes and Pharisees were
zealous &amp; exact in the outward forms
of the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> yet their hatred of
the power of that Religion appeared by
their obstinate rejecting and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Christ, and those that believed
on him. Many do imbrace a form of
the Christian Verity in the general
Doctrines, and in some plausible yet
superficial practice: Nevertheless they
cannot abide the genuine and spiritual
explication and close application of the
same Verity, leading to the life and
power thereof. Now if this were the
true state of the difference, that those
of the one perswasion only did urge the
necessity of the New Birth, and of a
holy and circumspect walking in all
Christians, and to that end seek the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61567:83"/>
of such a Ministry as (with
blessed <hi>Paul)</hi> travels in birth, till Christ
be formed in the Hearers, and such as
is quick and powerful, entring to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
of the soul and spirit, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the secret rottenness, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the self-confidence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
heart, and drives the soul out
of self to draw it to Christ; such a
Ministry as is assiduous and instant in
the dispensation of the word by instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
reproof and comfort, and in all
other parts of the Pastoral duty, that
as much as in it lies, it may present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man perfect in Christ: And if
those of the other perswasion account
the urging of these things severe foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
peevishness, pride, hypocrisie,
affected singularity, and suppose the
way to heaven common and easie, and
accordingly seek the advancement of
such a Ministry that is more smooth
and plausible then searching and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
more slack and cold in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
dispensation of the Word, and in
private admonition, indulging the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61567:84"/>
corruptions, and generally tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
with their carnal spirit; I say, if
the case were so between them, I could
proceed no further; for in such a case
to propose ways of Accommodation,
were to make proposals of Peace to
Parties divided by an everlasting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
but God forbid that the state of
the difference should be so deplorable.
We trust that neither the one nor the
other have so learned Christ as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
a form of Godliness, and deny the
power thereof. And that it is not or
ought not to be so, and that it is on all
hands disavowed with detestation, we
take it for a principle or ground-work
whereon to bottom our whole design.
The King Declares, <hi>That the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and desires of all those of either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
with whom he hath conferred, are
the same for the advancement of Piety and
true Godliness.</hi> Let the joynt pursuance
of these professions and desires set both
Parties agreed, especially since His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
hath thus Declared in these graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
words,—<hi>Our purpose and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61567:84"/>
is, and shall be, to promote the power
of Godliness, to encourage the exercises
of Religion both publick and private,
and to take care that the Lords Day may
be applyed to holy Exercises without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
divertisements; and that insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
negligent, and scandalous
Ministers may not be promoted in the
Church.—</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is an uncharitable and froward
spirit of opposition, by reason
of irritated animosity, and deep
suspition and jealousie, the root
of these discords?</p>

                     <head>Section XII.</head>
                     <p>We fear indeed that too much tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
if not bitterness of spirit, keeps
the Breach open. Differences of long
continuance and setled prejudices do
choak the exercise of Charity. And
the truth is, formerly the current of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
ran along to aggravate these
differences, and to exasperate these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:61567:85"/>
Let us now at length take hold
of the right means to stop this current
of contention. Remove the occasions,
lay aside controverted matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there will be no miss in the Church
of God: Let forms of Worship and
Government be so cut out, that they
may not pinch and gall the consciences
of either Party, as it may be done by
men of sober and charitable judgments
without any impeachment of such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and decency, as agrees with the
simplicity and spiritual Glory of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Administrations; so after a while
the froward humor that worketh on
both sides, would spend and lose it self:
Yea, I am perswaded that some spirits
now exulcerated through these distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
would not prove incurable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable.
After a little experience of
such proper healing remedies, both
sides will finde themselves brethren
that had mistaken one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
their common Interest.</p>

                     <p>Most serious thoughts of heart have
often led me to contemplate and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the peculiar calamity of the
Church of God in these Dominions,
that from time to time it hath been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with the most unhappy kind of
controversies: for they come not neer
the Foundation, nevertheless they are
very pernicious and destructive. They
consist not so much in speculation as
practice, and particularly their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
influence is upon the Churches
interest, and inevitably makes a breach
in Church-Unity. For Ecclesiastical
Offices, and Church Priviledges, and
Communion of Worship both in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and latter times, have been inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with such Forms and Rites and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needless rigors, that the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
was kept shut against many that
had received with the heart that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Faith which was once given to the
Saints. Hence proceeded despising
and judging one another, and deep
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61567:86"/>
censures, alienations and separations,
which will undo any Society of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Profession. The Papists not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their great boast of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are much more divided within
themselves than any Protestants from
each other; for the rent goes thorow
the main Foundation of their Faith.
With them the Head Corner-stone, or
rather the adequate Foundation, is
their Churches infallibility; but where
to place this pretended infallibility, they
can by no means agree: for upon the
matter one half of them place it in the
Pope, and the other in a general
Council. If you ask, <hi>How then doth
that vast Building hang together? How
doth that</hi> Babylonish <hi>Kingdom stand?</hi>
Surely they have the skill to make that
great point of difference a matter of
speculation more then of practice, and
they holdfast two main practical things
which do hold both in one; namely,
the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> under the Headship of
the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the <hi>Mass.</hi> They are all one
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61567:86"/>
both in Worship and Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and also in the whole body of
Ecclesiasticks, compacted by several
joynts and ligaments under one Papal
Head. Thus the children of this
world are wise in their generation; and
let the children of Light borrow this
point of Wisdom from them, which
is to take care that our different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do not brangle our Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
and Ecclesiastical Polity. And
in as much as Protestants have not that
Popish way of quick dispatch for all
controversies, which is to acquiesce in
the Churches infallibility; but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Principles, they must seek
their Warrant from Scripture, by the
help of the Churches directive, and
their own discretive Judgment; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way for them to hold themselves in
the bond of Peace, is to avoid all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of things unnecessary, in which
it is exceeding difficult, or morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for all sound Protestants to be
of the same perswasion.</p>

                     <head>Section XIV.</head>
                     <p>Let us here take notice of another
singular point of Wisdom, followed
by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was to shun, as a rock,
the determining of such Doctrines as
were controverted among the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;
and according to this setled
Rule the debates of that Council were
governed. Oft times indeed there arose
hot contests among the Divines about
Scholastical niceties, the several Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Friers being therein passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
addicted to their several opinions;
but the Prelates, who alone had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive
Voice, would always bring
things to a temper; and the Decrees
were so framed, that the Opinions of
neither Party were condemned. Let
the Church of Christ mingle this
Wisdom of the Serpent with his Dove-like
Innocency, to wit, not to urge
with severity things disputed amongst
sound and sober Protestants. But it
hath seemed good to some Protestants
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61567:87"/>
to walk by a contrary rule, to heighten
differences between themselves, and
those whom they called Puritanes, and
to judge them irreconcileable, and to
lessen differences between themselves
and the Romanists, in order to a Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
We hope that this errour is
or may be perceived by those that have
been inchanted into it. I am informed
by a Writer of our Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
who is of the Episcopal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
That an Episcopal Doctor
of great note, and now a Bishop, did
within these few years use his utmost
endeavours to gain upon the <hi>Sorbonists</hi>
in <hi>Paris,</hi> and thereupon that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with them as far as he could do
in Christian prudence, and with a safe
conscience. Now the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> are
the most moderate Papists, and the said
Doctor is known to be far enough
from the least smatch of Puritanism;
yet not any Accommodation could be
heard of between them, but rather the
contrary, even in the point of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:61567:88"/>
Seeing these things are so, one might
wonder that any learned men, zealous
of the Protestant Religion, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
averse from the true way of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among disagreeing Protestants, when
the pacification between Protestants
and Papists is become desperate. One
would conclude that Wise and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men could not be so overseen, if
there were not a deeper mystery in this
business.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereupon I pass to a further
Inquiry,</hi> Whether the foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these discords do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a carnal design? <hi>And
I shal argue even upon the case
of a worldly Interest?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the way of severe Imposing,
or of moderate Condescending,
be the more advisable?</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>If the settlement of the Churches
Peace, by giving needful satisfaction
and security to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and
the inlargement of the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
by taking in the multitudes of
that denomination, be neglected in this
discerning age, we must needs believe
that the root of this dissention goes
deeper then passions, prejudices and
mis-apprehensions, and that some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and partial Interest is that root of
bitterness that bears this gall and
wormwood.</p>
                     <p>Papists themselves have noted, that
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had rather abandon
the hopes of regaining three Kingdoms
to their pretended Catholick Church,
then declare it lawful for the English
Papists to take the Oath of Allegiance.
When the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was held,
&amp; most of the Princes that sent Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to the Council were instant that
some regard might be had of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and their recovery endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61567:89"/>
by moderation and reformation;
the Pope knowing that their return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such tearms could never be hoped
for, without the diminution of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
and Authority of his Court,
judged it most necessary for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of his pretended Apostolique See,
to make the division strong and the
Parties irreconcileable, that those
Countries and People which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in obedience to him might be kept
intirely Popish.</p>
                     <p>When men contend for the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
of mutable Orders, and stifly
oppose the due regulation of things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
and excessive, and resolve to
give no ground for the gaining of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
brethren, it is not the love of
Christ, but perverse self-love, and the
love of the world that constrains them.
Such interested persons are never good
Counsellors for the public weal.</p>

                     <p>Now in as much as some particular
carnal Interest is justly suspected in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61567:89"/>
impetuous and obstinate pursuance of
the things in controversie, we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
here to make it a question of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and upon that account to make an
address to the reason even of those that
are carried forth with greatest vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
in favour of the Episcopal, and
in opposition to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
All enterprises that have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in judgment and not in passion,
are directed to a certain end set up
as a mark, and that end is not a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at rovers, but some particular
steddy issue of things certainly or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
apprehended and expected:
Wherefore let wise men consider the
mark whereat they level, and to what
issue and state of things their actions
tend. Here is a numerous party, not
of the dreggs and refuse of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of the judicious and serious
part thereof: What will they do with
them? and how will they order the
matter concerning them? Would they
destroy them? I solemnly profess that
I abhor to think so by the generallity
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61567:90"/>
of the Episcopal perswasion: I would
disdain to mention such an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
impiety, were it not to shew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
and absurd proceedings of
an unalterable opposition, as that it
cannot drive to any formed end and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.
That <hi>Protestants</hi> should destroy
<hi>Protestants</hi> for dissenting in the point
of Ceremonies, and sole jurisdiction of
Bishops, is so dreadful a violation of
Charity and common honesty, that it
is a most uncharitable and dishonest
thing to suppose it of them. What
then? would they bear them down, or
keep them under hard Conditions?
Shall all persons that cannot yield ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
obedience to Ecclesiastical injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning all the parts of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
and Ceremonies, be suspended
and deprived as formerly? Shall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of this Judgment be cast and
kept out of Ecclesiastical preferment
and imployment? Shall all private
conferences of godly peaceable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
for mutual edification, be
held unlawful Conventicles? It hath
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61567:90"/>
been thought by wise men to be against
the Rules of Government, to hold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a rigid yoke a free people of such
a number and quality, and intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in all estates and rauks, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
conjoyned with all parts of the
body Politique, that it is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to exclude their Interest from
a considerable share in publique acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Besides, is it for the service of
Christ, and the encrease of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
the Church, that so many able
Divines should be debarred the use of
their Lords Talents, that so many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
Ministers should sit still in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
that when Christ teacheth us to
pray that the Lord would thrust forth
Labourers into his Harvest, those La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
should be thrust out of his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest?
Surely this would make a cry
in the ears of the Lord of the Harvest.
Let me add this, 'Tis a hard matter to
silence them that will preach virtually
in pious Conferences, whose occasional
and Table Discourses will be a kind of
Sermon.</p>

Let me offer a third way, Will they
afford them liberty of Conscience, and
yet stave them off, as a divided Party,
to stand alone in their Principles and
Interest? Verily I cannot think it is in
their heart so to do. What then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but to prepare the way, and to
make the path straight for a solid and
perfect closure, by laying aside those
unnecessary occasions of stumbling.</p>

                     <p>If the neglect of brotherly Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
hold on, and the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon their own advancement to
the highest pitch, one may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That they make a full reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to wear out the Presbyterians, and
to swallow up their Interest, conceiving
they are able to effect it by degrees;
and that greater changes then these
have been wrought without much ado.
And we confess indeed, that a great
change in Religion was made by Qu.
<hi>ELIZABETH</hi> without much
dispute or difficulty: The alteration
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61567:91"/>
was not sudden but gradual. <hi>Camden</hi>
writes, That in the entrance of the
Queens Reign, for a whole moneth and
more, the Roman Religion stood as it
did at the death of Queen <hi>MARY.</hi>
On the 27. of <hi>December</hi> the Epistles
and Gospels, the Lords Prayer, Creed
and Ten Commandements, together
with the Letany, were read in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Tongue. On the 22. of <hi>March</hi> the
intire use of the Sacrament in both
kinds was restored by Parliament. On
the 24. of <hi>June</hi> the Sacrifice of the
<hi>Mass</hi> was abolished, and the whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
restored into English. In <hi>July</hi>
the Oath of Supremacy was given to
the Bishops: And in <hi>August</hi> Images
were taken out of the Churches and
broken or burnt. Why may not the
<hi>Hierarchical</hi> Interest swallow up the
<hi>Presbyterian,</hi> as easily as <hi>Protestantism</hi>
prevailed over <hi>Popery?</hi> Surely I take
these several cases to be very different.
And first, because Queen <hi>ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH</hi>
had this fundameutal max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime
as agreeable to her Conscience and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61567:92"/>
the Interest of Her State, to banish
hence the exercise of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
But our Gracious King in His
Christian Prudence and Compassion
seeks the uniting of His Protestant
Subjects, and the healing of their
breaches, by His Wife and Gracious
condescentions already Declared. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
in the beginning of the Queens
Raign the inferiour Clergy of this
Kingdom universally appeared to be
but lukewarm Papists, and many of
them might be supposed to be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
in hearts, and the most of them
very unlearned, and indifferent men in
Religion. And a great part of the
<hi>Hierarchy</hi> were not more zealous than
the rest: For when at that time the
Ecclesiastical Promotions in <hi>England</hi>
were numbered above nine thousand
four hundred in all, there were not
more then fourscore Rectors of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
fifty Prebendaries, fifteen Heads
of Colledges, twelve Arch-Deacons,
twelve Deans, six Abbots and Abbes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and fourteen Bishops that refused
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61567:92"/>
the Oath of Supremacy. Also the
English Service was so prepared, that it
might be no abomination to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
no positive thing therein occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
repugnant to their Doctrine; for
which cause they frequented the same
for the first ten years; and the Pope
did not in many years send forth his
thunder &amp; lightning against the Queen.
And Popery being in substance a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
contrary to what was publickly
professed, had no advantage for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
by publick Preaching, or Books
publickly allowed, All these accidents
did help forward to an absolute settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Protestant Religion. But
we may find the state of things far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
in point of disposition or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
toward the Dominion of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Prelacy, and the rigorous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Ceremonies, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of the dissenting Party: For
there are now in <hi>England</hi> thousands of
Ministers dis-satisfied in the <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> who are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently,
and many of them eminently
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61567:93"/>
learned. They are not generally of
light spirits, but steddy and well resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and tenderly affected touching
their spiritual liberties. The way which
in scorn is called Puritanism, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Religion in substance than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism,
but the very same, or one
branch thereof distinguished from the
other by an accidental difference. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
and Puritane Doctrine and
Worship, all men may know to be the
same for substance; and Puritanism
will grow up with Protestantism, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all opposition, as I have
manifested in the former discourse.</p>
                     <p>Commonly those people who try all
Doctrines by Scripture, and are sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more by its Authority than by the
Ordinances and Customs of men, do
much hesitate and stagger concerning
the sole Jurisdiction of Bishops, the
pomp of the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Ceremonies of Humane Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And therefore let the Episcopal
Party never look to be rid of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
till they remove the matters
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61567:93"/>
in Question, whereat a knowing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are always ready to stumble.</p>
                     <p>Neither in these times are the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
so hateful a generation as
some would have them; they are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to none but those to whom they
were ever odious, or else to such Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
as follow the Cry, and speak evil
of they know not what. They have had
no considerable loss of their number
by revolt; and whatever comes to pass,
they think never the worse of their
main Cause, which I have expressed in
the Character given of them: And if
some or many of them have a liberry
in their own judgements touching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
yet that conformity will not
strengthen the designs of those Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
that are most rigid in such imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and seek to tread down the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians.
It was a notable question
which a Carthaginian Senator put to
<hi>Hanibal</hi>'s Agents, after the great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
given to the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Canna.</hi>
When they had magnified <hi>Hanibal</hi>'s
great Atchievements, <hi>Hanno</hi> asked
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61567:94"/>
them, <hi>Whether any of the</hi> Romans <hi>had
come to demand Peace; and whether any
Town of the Latines, or any of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
had yet rebelled against the Romans?</hi>
The Agents denying the one and the
other, <hi>Hanno</hi> replied, <hi>Then is the War
as intire yet as at the first.</hi> I apply this,
to shew how easily men mistake the
progress of their own affairs, and think
themselves to be ready for a triumph,
when indeed they have gotten little,
and the state of the controversie is still
as intire and firm as ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hitherto I have asserted</hi> the Interest of
the Universality in opposition to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of a partial Interest. <hi>I have
endeavoured to make it manifest,</hi>
That the several Parties by a mutual
yielding and waving their partial Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
may be united to promote the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the Universality: for <hi>I have laid
these ground-works, to wit;</hi> That the
breach is not kept open by any formed
Doctrine or Conclusion of either Party,
nor (as I trust) by the spirit of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61567:94"/>
enmity; but either by a humour of
opposition, that may be qualified and
subdued; or by some carnal design, which
may and must be denied when its errour
and danger is discovered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the remainder of this Discourse I am
to shew,</hi> That the Presbyterians are
fit and worthy to be imbodied with the
whole number of the good people of
<hi>England; in the next place</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Union by several Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and then to remove certain
impediments, and to argue from the
particular concernments of the King,
of the Nobility and Gentry, and of the
Episcopal Clergy; <hi>and lastly,</hi> to offer
some few essays concerning the paths of
Peace.</p>

                     <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was sometimes constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the weakness of some and the
malice of others, to boast on his own
behalf, and to Apologize again and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61567:95"/>
again for speaking as a fool: I trust
therefore that wise men will bear with
that unto which the like necessity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
me, on the behalf of the people that
are now denominated <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> In
estimating the numbers of this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it is not the right way to go by the
Poll throughout all sorts promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
but to take a survey of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and active sort of the people, and
in that sort to compare their number
with others. Howbeit in any way of
reckoning suppose them the lesser, yet
they may be found a balancing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But I am willing to pass from
number to weight. They that will not
acknowledge them to be sincere, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny them to be serious persons;
they that will not acknowledge them to
be sober in their judgements, cannot
deny them to be sober in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.
But we know they are both
serious, and sincere, and sober, as well
in Religion as in Morality: and a few
sober people are more valuable, both
for Religious and Civil concernments,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61567:95"/>
than a multitude of dissolute or vain
and empty persons. One serious ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
man will carry more in fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
than all the vapourers in the
neighbourhood. Those that are ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the Presbyterians commonly
despise them as an unlearned dull sort
of men knowing nothing. Truly we
will not herein boast beyond our line,
nor magnifie those of our own perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in derogation to any others; but
we think that this disparagement is cast
upon them because they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no vapourers. Surely they have
amongst them both Divines and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who do not use to turn their
backs upon gainsayers, but have been
and will be ready to render a reason of
their judgment and practice to any that
shall demand it of them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
we do not envy the learning of any
Episcopal Divines, but gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, and desire to partake in
the benefit of it, and wish that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
gift is received by any, may be
more and more servicable to the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61567:96"/>
Church of God. Neither are they an
ignoble abject sort; it hath not at all
appeared that they have degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the English Virtue and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
They have for common tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
and safety closed with the first
opportunity for a general accord, and
so have knowingly made way for the
reviving of the other Party, supposing
that the former enmity would cease.
And they had reason to hope, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
the joy of the Nation, they
should not be left in sadness. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
interruption and check given to
this expected reconciliation, we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the hurry of mens minds upon
this great and unexpected change,
by which it happeneth that they scarce
know where they are, and hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves within due bounds. But
we trust that these passions will be over,
and the spirits of all will settle in a calm
and good temper. Hitherto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
may pass for the effects of
passion, not of inveterate malice,
wherefore, <hi>dum res est integra,</hi> let se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61567:96"/>
thoughts be milder. A quick pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of Count <hi>Olivares</hi> touching the
right way of Accommodation, may
be pertinent to this business. Our late
Soveraign, when Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> being
in the Spanish Court in pursuance of
the marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and the Negotiation being clogged
with many interruptions, discontents
and jealousies, and all being like to fall
asunder, <hi>Olivares</hi> whether in humour
or earnest propounded these three
ways; The first, <hi>That Prince</hi> Charles
<hi>should become a Catholique;</hi> The second,
<hi>That the</hi> Infanta <hi>should be delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him upon the former security without
further Condition;</hi> The third was, <hi>To
bind him as fast as they could, and not to
trust him with any thing.</hi> Of these three
ways, he said, the two former were
good; but the last was a bad one. In
like manner might a discerning Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
resolve, that there be three ways of
bringing these disputes to an issue; The
first, <hi>That the Presbyterians should vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
become Episcopal, and thorowly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61567:97"/>
conformable;</hi> The second, <hi>That the way
of brotherly accord should be held open
and secure to them by an equal Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;</hi>
The third, <hi>That they be trusted
in nothing, but bound up fast by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Condition that can be imposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Of these
three ways let him conclude with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his own interest, that the two
former are good, but the last very
bad.</p>

maxime of Queen <hi>ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH</hi>
to banish hence the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the Roman Religion, because
it was the onely means to break all the

pretext did here foment Rebellion. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same ground the Law banisheth
Popish Priests, that Forreign influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
might not distemper this Kingdom:
But the Presbyterians can have no
temptation to tamper with Forreign
Combinations; for their Interest is
precisely and perfectly Protestant, and
for their unreconcilableness to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their greatest adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries

when ever this Land shall have need

                     <p>Some men resolving in all things to
detract from the Presbyterians, have
said, That they promoted the Kings
Return, not out of good will to His
Majesty, or a love of Order and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but out of fear of being destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Phanaticks. Upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of this surmise, and the evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
thereof, I am willing to debate this
Question.</p>
                     <p>Whether the Presbyterians closure with
the King in all avowed subjection and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
be sincere and solid, that His Majesty
may safely confide in them?</p>
                     <p>The pretended reason of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity
seems to me to add much to
their reputation in that behalf: For if
the Phanaticks would destroy them, it
is manifest that they are none of them.
Phanaticks would not destroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
willingly. The several various
Sects will wrangle with each other in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61567:99"/>
verbal contests; but they never know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
plotted or banded against each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the account of their different
Opinions, but did all unite in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principle of pretended liberty of
Conscience, and in one common cause
of Universal Toleration. Be it also
granted, that self-preservation enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Presbyterians by any means to
obviate and overturn the designs of the
Sectaries, it shews that the Sectarian
Interest and theirs are Inconsistent, as
also that they are not unreconcilable to
the Episcopal part of Protestants; and
that they had pacifick inclinations, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to put a period to these contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Let men surmise the worst they can
of their intentions in declaring for the
King; yet in as much as they had a
choice before them, to turn this way or
that way, it is evident they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves to that way that had
the lesser evil and the fairer shew of
good. And could any think that they
would knowingly make a choice of
that which should destroy their just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61567:99"/>
wherefore were it no more than
this, it might gain them some regard,
for that they hoped for some good in
this way, when they could hope for
none at all from the wilde ways and
fancies of Phanaticks: But the truth is,
they turned not to a lesser evil, but to a
thing in it self desirable; for it was a
clear case to men of sound minds and
sober Principles, that there was no way
to lead us out of that wilderness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we wandred, but the uniting of all
sound and sober Protestants in things
wherein all agree, and a mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
in things not necssary to
peace and edification. The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
knew their single Interest would
not settle the Nation: And the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians
may know as well that their
single Interest will prove dificient. In
such a case, what well-minded persons
affecting the peace of the Church and
Kingdom would not promote the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Royal Family, that the
King, in whom alone the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can settle, may pare off the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61567:100"/>
of particular partial Interests,
and make a Union in the general Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the Protestant Religion, and of
Great <hi>Britain?</hi> This was the scope of
the Presbyterian design in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
And as touching their cordial
affection to His Majesties Person and
Government, we have their own more
affectionate and solemn professions for
it, which are graciously owned by His
Majesty. And if any persist to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
those expressions, seeing they are
not searchers of hearts, it lies upon
them to prove this pretended disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by something discernable in the
outward behaviour. But suppose that
a peoples Conscience and good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and disposition be called into
question, yet this is a maxime unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
<hi>That the main ground of sure
and constant benevolence between Prince
and People, is a firm perswasion, that they
are the mntual Interest of each other.</hi> His
Majesties Royal Person and His
Princely Virtues are amiable to us; He
is a Crown of Glory to the English
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61567:100"/>
Nation: But that which got the maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over all difficulties, in restoring Him
to His Dominions, was an undoubted
knowledge that the Nations Interest
was bound up in Him our indubitable
Soveraign Lord. There is a necessity
of meer compulsion that drives the
unwilling, and there is a necessity of
Interest that draws a willing people:
When this latter necessity doth bring a
Prince and People together, ingenuous
minds will turn this necessity into a
virtue; and so the joyning of Interests
draws after it the joying of hearts.
The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> enjoyning the same
protection and benefit which other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Protestants</hi> and Loyal Subjects,
will see no other probable nor possible
way of repose and safety, but under His
Majesties happy Government. It is not
therefore a necessity of present force,
but of constant Interest, which is here
commended, as so great a bond of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and which Princes use to take for
their best security. The wisest way is,

Commotions, and manifold chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61567:101"/>
it was abased, enfeebled, and
brought very low; all which do shew
that some great distemper had taken
hold of this Body Politick, before
these things could break forth: There
is at length by the late Revolution a
providential offer of rest and peace.
After those sad conflicts, and this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
offer of Providence, shall the seeds
of discord lodge perpetually in this
Land? I fear passions of bitterness are
too ready to stir and provoke. Take
away this fuel of strife, the urging of
things to uphold distinctions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Whilest things are at such a pass,
animosities will arise upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
discontents and quarrels will be
ready to break forth in every Town

companies and occasional Meetings.
But let the propounded Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be accepted and established, and
the former mutual injuries will pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>Uniformity in Religion is beautiful
and amiable; but we ought to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not only what is desirable, but
what is attainable. There have been,
are, and always will be such points as
the Apostle tearms <hi>doubtful disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
When the severity of Laws and
Canons inforce external Uniformity
in things of this nature, it exerciseth a
tyranny over mens judgments, and
holds them in a servile condition, that
they are not free, but captivated to the
Authority of men, or suppressed from
making a due search into matters of
Religion; yea, this thraldom will ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
reach to things of an higher
nature, even the vital parts of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
That servile Principle which
hath the heart of Popery in it, must
be introduced, to wit, that the Laity
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61567:102"/>
should not search the Scriptures, nor
try the Doctrines delivered, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in what their Teachers say,
without the Exercise of their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or judgment of discretion. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
will follow gross ignorance and
supine carelesness in the things of God,
and in those that any whit mind Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(which is the best of the matter)
a blind devotion: And a people rude
and servile in Religion will be rude
and dissolute in Conversation, as we
see in Popish Countries, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where spiritual tyranny prevaileth.
This is so great an evil that it cannot be
countervailed by all the imaginable
benefit of Uniformity: And the truth
is, all profitable Uniformity is mingled
with sobriety, and stands not in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible
point, but admits a latitude,
and by a little variety in matters of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
moment, becomes more graceful,
because it is more unstrained and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected.</p>

                     <p>It is a chief point of knowledge in
those whose work it is to mould and
manage a Nation according to any
order of things, to undrestand what
is the temper of the people, what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
possess and govern them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Parties of them, and to what
pass things are already brought among
them.</p>
                     <p>Those who duly observe and regard
the disposition and present State of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and the principles and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the several considerable Parties,
will be able to give the best advice for
a happy settlement: For such a course
as is wisely and succesfully taken in
one Nation, may in the like business
prove unfortunate in another Nation,
or in the same at another time. A State
may probably root out such opinions
as it conceives to be heterodox and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient,
by using great severity in
the beginning, when the opinions are
but newly sowed in mens minds, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61567:103"/>
the people are of such a nature, as to
abhor dangers, and aim to live secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and when the Nation in general is
devoted to the ancient customs of their
fore-fathers. But the same course may
not be taken when the opinions have
been deeply rooted and far spread, by
long continuance, in a Nation of a free
spirit, and zealous; and the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of those that in a Law sence are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Cives,</hi> do not detest them. At this
day <hi>England</hi> affords a multitude of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Zealots, and a multitude of
Presbyterian Zealots, balancing the
former; and between these two there
lye a more indifferent sort of people,
whereof a great number care for none
of these things; but others are more
intelligent and considerate; and these
seem to approve some things, and again
to disapprove some things on either
side: As far as I have observed, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
sort of men do accord with the
Episcopal way in affecting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book;
and those among
them, that are of any reckoning for
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61567:104"/>
worth or honesty, do also according
to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way, affect the
constant preaching of the Word, and
the residency of Ministers in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Charges, and disaffect plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Benefices. Knowledge hath
so increased that the people in general
will more observe their Teachers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and conversation; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
of the one, and the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
of the other shall not pass
without noting. The insufficient, idle,
and scandalous will fall into contempt,
and be slighted by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The profanation of the Lords
Day by open sports and pastimes is by
the Civil part of the Nation account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
scandalous. Furthermore, the
present Age being more discerning, all
sorts affect a greater liberty of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Discourse then hath been
used in former times. Whereupon
the State of this Kingdom requires a
temper or <hi>medium</hi> between two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
to wit <hi>medium abnegationis,</hi>
in those unnecessary things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61567:104"/>
no accord can be expected
between the Parties, by abolishing,
or not injoyning them, and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
participationis,</hi> in things necessary
to Order and Government, wherein
the moderate of both Parties do easily
comply with each other. When the
State like a prudent Mother, not led by
the passions of her angry Children,
shall not engage in their quarrels on this
or that side, but settle such a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their common good, love and
peace may ensue between the Parties,
though difference of judgment still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.
When the Nation shall not
espouse to it self the Interest of a party,
but intirely reserve it self for the good
of the Universality, those hot disputes
and contests will of themselves fall to
the ground; and men of different judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will be less fond of their own
opinions, when they observe that the
State doth not judge its happiness to
rest upon any of them, and that the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Church and Kingdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
without them.</p>

                     <p>This Kingdom after the removing
of foundations, is by a marvellous turn
re-established upon its ancient basis.
And verily that which hath wrought
the change will settle it; that which
hath brought such things to pass will
keep them where they are, if we do
not overlook and sleight it. And what
was it but the consent of the universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the Vote of all <hi>England?</hi> This
did produce an universal motion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
vehement, but not violent:
For it was not against, but according to
nature. All things having been out of
place, and held in a state preternatural,
when the force was taken off, moved
to their center and place of rest, to wit,
the ancient fundamental constitution.
And for this cause the change was not
terrible, but calm, kindly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody.
Now as that natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which carries things to their
resting place, will keep them there,
untill by violence they are forced
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61567:105"/>
thence; so this consent of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality,
which produced a kindly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things to settle in their own
place and order upon the right foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
will keep them there, until such
external force shall come, as can break
and dissipate the universality. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing this great revolution hath
not happened by the prevailing force
of one Party, but by the unstrained
motion of all <hi>England,</hi> what reason is
there that one Party should thrust the
other out of its due place of rest upon
the common Foundation? When com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent hath laid this excellent
Foundation of peace and quietness, let
not the Superstructure of particular
unnecessary forms cast off some as a
divided and rejected Party; but let that
which hath made peace keep peace;
which by Gods help it will surely do,
if timely observed and followed.</p>

of these differences hath much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61567:106"/>
and requires much prudence,
care and patience in those that are at the
helm of Government: Nevertheless
it may be effected, if the judicious on
both sides will give consent; and they
will give consent, if they have a single
aim to procure the peace of Gods
Church, and the increase thereof, and
particularly the increase and stability
of Protestant Religion: Suppose the
<hi>Roman, Grecian, Armenian, Ethiopick,</hi>
together with all the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
yea and the whole Christian
world might be drawn into one
Church-Communion and Order, upon
as easie tearms as English <hi>Prelatists</hi> and
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> may, if they have a heart
to it, were it not prodigious unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
and fury of opposition to
withstand it? As all the Lovers of
Christianism would pursue the Union
of all Christian Churches, upon such
tearms, so should all the Lovers of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism
pursue the Union of all
Protestant Churches, seeing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
wherein they harmoniously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61567:106"/>
will enable them to keep <hi>the Unity
of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> if the
heart be not opposite to the power of
those professed Doctrines. To heal
the wounds of the Protestant Cause,
how glorious is it? But to refuse and
withstand this healing, how doth it
cause the Popish faction to glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us? <hi>Let not our adversaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,

                     <p>We have the examples of Christian
Princes, even of those of the Roman
Faith, who would gladly have made
up breaches in Religion among their
people, by yielding in things of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
moment in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
then any of the points in question are
among disagreeing Protestants. In the
Council of <hi>Trent, Ferdinand</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and <hi>Maximilian</hi> his son King
of the Romans, and the French King,
and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> made it their
business by their Embassadors, for qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61567:107"/>
of their Dominions, that the
Communion of the Sacrament in both
kinds, the Marriage of Priests, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service in the vulgar tongue
might be allowed. These things are
of greater importance among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
then the things now in question
are among the Protestants of either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
if we judge by their declared
Opinions, and not by some hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
And those forenamed Princes
would surely have taken that way for
uniting their people, had their power
been independent in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but having dependance upon the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> they could do nothing
without the Authority either of the
Pope or the Council; from either of
which they perceived after much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that such Reformation could
not be hoped for. Moreover those
Princes being of the Roman Faith, had
a fairer pretence according to Popish
Principles, to crush the dissenting Part
of their Subjects, by laying Heresie
to their charge, and so in time to root
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61567:107"/>
them out, then any Protestant State
can have to extirpate the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Likewise the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth, after his great Atchievements,
designing to establish an intire Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in Germany, conceived that his
way was to unite the German Nation
in point of Religion, by a kind of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
or Accommodation; for which
he laboured so much in procuring and
upholding the <hi>Trent</hi>-Council; until at
length despairing of his Sons successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Empire, he laid aside all
thoughts of restoring the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and by consequence
all care of the Council, though he
continued many years after in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Authority.</p>
                     <p>Now though all these Princes were
deceived in expecting such a Union by
means of that Council, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of divers and important Interests of
Princes and <hi>Prelates,</hi> could not possibly
have such an end as was by some of
them desired; yet herein they took not
their aim amiss, that the re-uniting of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61567:108"/>
their broken people, by using a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Accommodation, was the best
way to keep their Estates intire.</p>

                     <p>One great impediment is an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgment touching the times fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
the late Wars. For as much as
great and manifold distempers have
happened and continued in this Land
since the beginning of these troubles,
the defects of former times are quite
forgotten, as it commonly comes to
pass, that latter miseries, it drawn out
to any length, do drown the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance
of by-past evils; but he who
discerns only things at hand, and not
affar off, is purblind. I abhor to take
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61567:109"/>

times, the distempers whereof
I would not in any wise palliate. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
let this be noted, distempers
have their times of breeding as well as
of breaking forth. Certainly that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Tempest which succeeded the
long Calm in this Nation, had its time
of gathering in the Clouds. To heal
the symptomes of a disease, its rooted
cause being neglected, is but a pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
cure. To take away the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
of these latter times, and not to
inquire into the former causes, is to
hide, but not to heal the maladies of
this Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>Another errour which turns away
mens eyes from beholding the true
state of their own affairs, is a contempt
of the dissenting Party, and of their
Opinions, as silly and irrational; with
which is joyned a vain conceit, that
the whole Party with their Opinions
would soon fall to the ground, if a few
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61567:109"/>
turbulent and factious spirits (as they
pretend) were taken out of the way.
This makes men to bear down their
opposites more with scorn and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely,
then with any temperate and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
reasoning. This makes men wilful,
precipitate, unmerciful, and puts them
forward by rigid injunctions and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
inquisitions to suppress those with
whom they might walk in one way, if
they themselves did walk in love: But
there is as little of Reason as Religion
in this self-admiring humour. It is the
part of weak and selfish minds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
Religion to certain modes and
forms which stand not by Divine
Right, but by the wills of men,
and which are of little efficacy,
and very disputable, and if sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
lawful, ought to be governed
by the rule of Charity. To think that
none is a good Christian, a sound <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi>
a fit minister, that cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to such modes and forms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a narrow and ignoble
judgment. It is also as much pride as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61567:110"/>
weakness to contemn the setled way
of a knowing and serious people, sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in their Principles and practices, as
if they were worthy of no regard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they dissent in some points which
in themselves are of little moment.
This is for men to think, that they only
are the people, and that wisdom shall
dye with them. Noble and high ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
and judgments of a large and
deep reach, do know they cannot square
the world by the narrow compass of
those conceived Principles that have
possessed and seasoned their own
mindes: But they look also without
themselves, rightly judging, that as
they have their own peculiar Notions,
so another sort have theirs; and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
men are carried divers ways, as
they are led by natural temper, custom,
education, or studious inquires. They
know likewise that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
of all mindes to one perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without imbasing their judgments
to perfect slavery, which we see put in
practice in the Antichristian Kingdom
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61567:110"/>
of the Papacy: Whereupon men of
vastest parts and learning, and of true
nobleness of judgment have been ever
favourable to those which dissented
only in such opinions, as amongst
wise and sober men are not with one
consent determined, unless their
peculiar Interest were bound up in
those Opinions: For this noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of judgment, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclines to allow ones self and others
this righteous liberty, is sometimes dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
back and streightned by politick
Interests. Verily a judgment truly
noble is truly Catholick; and true
Catholicism is most contrary to that
which is so called by pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks:
For it is to maintain Christian
Concord with all Christians, as far as
they hold Christ the Head.</p>

                     <p>It is incident to ruling men to cherish
the passion of indignation against the
dissenting Party. Hence ariseth a great
perturbation of judgment: For by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61567:111"/>
of the dominion of this passion,
when dissenters modestly assert their
Principles, and do not instantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
as much as is expected, it is taken
for petulancy and peevishness. When
some degree of frowardness breaks
forth, it is encountred with that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which hazards the undoing of the
weak Part, that should and might be
healed: And their dis-satisfaction is
judged the effect of incurable pride
and malice. This perturbation of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
begets a great distemper in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Councils. Wherefore let per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
bearing Rule watch over this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
passion, and dread its tyranny.
First, let not perversness be always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the non-compliancs of the
inferiour Party. God hath put it into
the Kings heart to extend compassion
to multitudes of His Loyal Subjects, in
taking off the rigour of sundry impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
in matters Ecclesiastical; and
they think it good to make use of those
His Majesties Concessions, without
the prejudice of any part of Religion,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61567:111"/>
or of order and decency in the Church.
Others that should have helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
His Majesties design of Peace,
are offended, saying, The <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
yield in nothing, the late indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
hath made them more resolved
against all points of Conformity; but
why should their eye be evil because
His Majesties eye is good? Have the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> abated nothing, when,
for peace sake they have declared a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to part with the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
platform of Church-Government,
which is used in other Reformed
Churches, and to submit to a regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Episcopacy; as also to wave the
Directory for Worship, and to accept
a Reformed Liturgy? Indifferent men
would judge that this is a good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards peace, and that a closure
is hereby really intended. But what
have the <hi>Prelatists</hi> done in testimony of
their moderation? Have they desisted
from the use of any one of the former
Ceremonies, even such as be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by any Law or Canon? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61567:112"/>
some of the Presbyterians (be they
few or many) do as yet forbear the
using of some Forms, which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
not simply unlawful; perhaps
some reason of scandal may cause this
forbearance; otherwise to the injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
they might seem to contradict their
own Principles, out of servile fear, or
for worldly ends; and the malicious
might take occasion, though none
were given, to reproach them for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing.
Now it concerns Christs
Ministers to prevent, what in them lies,
not onely a just, but even an unjust and
causeless contempt of their Ministry.
Besides, they are not willing that some
persons of good affections, but weaker
judgments, should take offence at their
early and easie compliance, and so fall
into down-right separation. The <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
attend a good Reformation,
and all necessary inlargement that may
encompass and gather together in one
all that are of sound belief and good
life, who have been so long scattered
abroad. Nothing therefore appears
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61567:112"/>
but that they have hitherto conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and judiciously made use of His
Majesties Favour; and with great
thankfulness have they expressed their
sence thereof, in their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to God and men: His Royal and
Paternal Charity is precious to them.</p>
                     <p>But suppose that some of this way
were guilty of some provoking fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
should grave Patriots and
wise Counsellors thereupon destroy
the weak part, or rather heal it?
A prudent Father is not so provoked
by the stubbornness of a Child as to
cast him out, and make him desperate;
whilest there is yet hope concerning
him. It is meet indeed for Princes to
express their just indignation, when
Subjects presuming on their clemency
do not contain themselves within their
duty; and the seasonable expression
of such disdain, wisely managed, is of
great force in Government; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
if it get the mastery it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perillous. It was the Counsel
of indignation that proceeded from
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61567:113"/>
                        <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s young Counsellors.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet a greater mischief,
when the cloud of this passion darkens
the Understanding, that it cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between present dis-satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and incurable pride and malice.
When a peoples present dis-satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
about remediable grievances, shall
be deemed implacable enmity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
pernicions councels take place:
Then it will be suggested to a Prince,
that the Acts of Grace bestowed upon
such a people make them but the more
insolent: For none may hope to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
pride by condescention, or
inveterate malice by good turns;
which is indeed a true saying, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by mis-application. In this case
to judge rightly of things that differ,
let a Prince consider diligently whether
the present averseness proceeds from
rooted Principles, and a fixed Interest,
inconsistent with the security of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
or from the pressures of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Party, in things which are not the
necessary props of his Power, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61567:113"/>
without which his greatness may well
consist; and let him never question the
gaining of such a people whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and designs are not against the
true and proper Interest of his Estate,
whatsoever their present distempers be;
for the grievances being redressed, time
will wear out those distempers: And
in that case a people will not less value
their Prince, because he yieldeth to
them with respect to his own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for they will not judge it a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
yielding, because that proceeds
from force which is yielded for present
necessity, and against the main Interest;
but they will cleave to him the more,
by discerning that his and their good
do agree in one; for it makes them
hope that he will seek their good as his
own. When Governours resent the
non-compliances of a party, their best
remedy is to remove the occasions,
when it may be done without crossing
the Interests of State or Maximes of
Government; then will the honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
be mollified and moulded; and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61567:114"/>
towards the residue of obstinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
if there be any such, severity will
be used more succesfully. It is the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of rulers by all means to lessen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
and to contract the number of
offenders: For where there are many
sufferers upon a Religious account,
whether in truth or pretence, there will
be a kind of glory in suffering, and
sooner or later it may turn to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
detriment.</p>

                  <div n="32" type="section">
                     <head>Section XXXII.</head>
                     <p>Another great impediment of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
concord is an erroneous confidence
in the more numerous Party, that they
need not seek nor mind the way of
peace; for they reckon themselves
sure to carry it by the <hi>major</hi> Vote in all
Councils and Conventions; they see
wind and tide serving them: But they
who consider but few things, do make
a sudden judgment, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falls short. Great prosperity oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
blinds the wise as well as fools;
and great advantages divert the mind
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61567:114"/>
from heeding many important circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of a business, that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made concerning it is most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect:
Wherefore in the present case
it should be minded, that the dissenting
party is not small, that it is not made up
of the rabble multitude, nor yet of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natique
spirits, but of honest and sober
people, who act from principles of
knowledge, and can render a reason of
their practice, in things pertaining to
conscience, with as much discretion as
any sort of men in the Nation; that
the instances which they make do
not concern by-matters and mutable
occasions, but matters of conscience,
that will never cease nor vary; that
they are not a party far distant, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near; I mean not only in respect of
place (for so the <hi>Papists</hi> that live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us cannot be far from us) but
of agreement in Principles of Religion,
that they cannot be well severed nor
kept in a divided State, nor yet be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out; but they will grow up under
the influence of the Doctrine professed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61567:115"/>
in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deliberations they may be able to
put things to a stand, and in debates of
great consequence to lead the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
sort of men, and also many tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
spirits of the other perswasion, by
the apparent equity of their proposals.</p>
                     <p>All these things and more of the like
nature, do challenge a due regard from
those that would see through a business,
and make a perfect judgment. Besides,
the judicious should consider not only
the bulk and corps of a party, but what
spirit doth quicken them, and with what
vivacity and constancy their motions
do proceed, and their Interest is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued.
It comes also within the compass
of this inquiry to know the intrinsick
strength of the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and what
they can do when they stand by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
alone, for their adventitious
strength may fail them. We need not
tell them, that on their side at present
the advantage is very great, yet haply
it may appear in shew greater then it is
indeed. Though the English Nation
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61567:115"/>
appear to affect a stated Order in the
Church, nevertheless they may not
serve the designs of the Hierarchy, nor
yet be conscious thereof. Upon the
late great revolution, the multitude
do easily run from one extream to an
other, thinking they cannot run too far
from those troubles and discomposures
which last oppressed them. But as the
prudent ponder their paths at present,
so the passionate multitude may at
length know where they are, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
alike the evil of both extreams.
Many that are lifted up may give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and fall under great displeasure;
they that are cast down may be better
advised by their sufferings, and remove
the occasions of stumbling, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
if not indeared, yet inoffensive
to the Nation. Such vicissitudes of love
and hatred do happen in every age, and
<hi>there is no new thing under the Sun.</hi>

                     <head>Section XXXIII.</head>
                     <p>Another obstacle in the way of this
conjunction is an opinion of many, that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61567:116"/>
the sure and only means of preventing
schism, and maintaining unity in the
Church, is by multiplying Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
injunctions and Canons, by requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
full conformity to controverted
forms, which might well be spared, by
exacting not only submission of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
but assent of judgment declared
by subscription to all particulars of
Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, in
every jot and tittle thereof. But in very
deed this is the sure way of endless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention
among a people that are not
bottomed on this principle of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as the Church believes. This kind
of imposing hath discomposed all
Christendom, and rends the several
Churches from each other, and makes
the rent incurable. It is the way of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> upon this account
is guilty of the foulest schism that was
ever made in the Christian world. It is
a notable saying of <hi>Chillingworth,—
Not Protestants for rejecting, but the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>for imposing on the
faith of Christians, Doctrines unwritten
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61567:116"/>
and unnecessary, and for disturbing the
Churches peace, and dividing Unity in
such matters, is in an high degree presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and schismatical.</hi>—God is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for his worship, and consciences
well informed and duly tender are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
jealous concerning it, lest they
should provoke God to jealousie.
Mindes truly religious do set an high
price on matters of conscience, and will
expose all to sale rather then cross their
principles. Wherefore if in matters
of perpetual controversie between god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wise persons, the Church shall make
peremptory decrees and severe injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
it must needs dissolve the band
of unity. But the best and surest means
of preventing and suppressing Schisms,
is to prevent corrupt administrations,
and real scandals in matters Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and seasonably to reform abuses,
and not to interpose in lesser differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                     <p>Furthermore, a great prejudice is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61567:117"/>
up against Bishops ruling in conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iation
with Presbyters, and against
Classical, or Presbyterian meetings, as
inclining to Faction, and likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
alterations, which evils are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to follow tbe distributing of the
power among many. Whereupon the
Government of a single Person, or a
Bishop having sole Jurisdictson, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
to be the surest means of
keeping Church affairs in a fixed state:
This prejudice having a great shew of
truth, we must stoop to pry into it more
narrowly. And first we have this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
maxime to direct us in this inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that the condition of the people to
be governed is the best rule of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the aptest form of Government.
And according to this principle we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
that absolute <hi>Prelacy</hi> is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Government to hold a people that
content themselves with a customary
service, and the Religion of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and of their fore-fathers, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be. All Discourses, Debates,
Disputations, and all occasions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61567:117"/>
touching Religion, and particularly
that exercise which is called prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
must be avoided. But this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not so agreeable to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that are given to search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and try Doctrines. In <hi>England</hi>
where the inferior Clergy or Parochial
Ministery is not rude and ignorant, but
in a great part learned and conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
where the common people in a
great part try all things, that they may
<hi>hold fast that which is good;</hi> the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
jurisdiction cannot conveniently
reside in a Prelate alone governing by
severe Canons, and denouncing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
against all those that
express any dissent from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the received Forms of Worship
and Discipline. For among such a
people, this is a likelier way to beget
some great distemper, then to keep all
in quietness and deep silence. But a
form of Government more free by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing
the power among many, and
regular meetings for free debates with
in certain limits will be much more
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61567:118"/>
peaceable and succesful. It is here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that in such an order of
things dissentions may arise, and cause
some interruptions. Nevertheless no
great inconvenience, but sometimes
much advantage may follow. The stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of warm contests may be unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
condemned, For as Thunder
purgeth the Air, so these stirrings may
purge the Church from Corruptions
ingendering in it. Let the frame and
order of things be so established, that
both parties may be made hopeless
concerning factious attempts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
this or that extream, that the
contests may not be on the one side for
Dominion, nor on the other side for
inordinate liberty, but on both sides
for Truths due freedom, and then they
will end in peace. If great mistakes
should arise in such meetings, and seem
for a while to pass currently, there may
be found some persons of that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
integrity and reputation, as to
be able to shew the fallacy, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
those of both sides that intend
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61567:118"/>
uprightly. In which case if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an evil spirit on work, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
design hatching among some, they
will turn away with indignation from
the contrivers of such mischief. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the frame of Ecclesiastical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
lean neither towards Tyranny nor
Anarchy, but be set upright for just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Let good orders be kept and
priviledges not violated, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
number of those who mean honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will not be led into the snare of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And selfish ambitious pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
spirits that trouble them will easily
be detected and abandoned.</p>

Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> for prevention of
Errour and Heresie by a gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the parochial meeting to
the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> from thence to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Synod, and from thence to the
general Assembly for determining any
controversie, saying,—<hi>Thus bears
the face of a very fair and laudable course,

But let me add, <hi>That either we have or
may have (in this very state of things, with
some small variation) in effect the very
same Government with us. Instead of
Presbyteries consisting of several Pastors,
we have our combinations of Ministers in
our several Deanries, over whom the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Dean is chosen every year by the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of that Division, as their Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
This Deanry or Presbytery may be
enjoyned to meet every moneth, or oftner,
in some City or Town next to them; and
there they may have their exercise of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,
as I have known it practised in
some parts of this Kingdom, as it is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
wished and recommended by that

Excellently Learned Lord</hi> Verulam <hi>in
his prudent Considerations; where if any
Question fail of determination, it may be

                     <p>His Majesties Concernment in this

and give over in time when
they have builded their own houses.
Many, and perhaps the most, if chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

Times for their own security; but the
King never descends from the Stage of
publick Action, and can never cease to
be interessed in His people. Others

                     <p>After so long a War between King

in Government, the King being at
length restored to His full Power and
Greatness, and the people being sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with Civil Warres, tumults and
changes; it may be concluded, that
they will not easily run the hazard of
abetting any Parties, in contradiction
to Him: But this is happily or unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
suggested, as it is turned to a good
or a bad use: Though evil Counsels
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61567:121"/>
may turn it to a bad use, yet it yields un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
advantage to the wholesome
Counsels both of King and People, for
the good of both. The people knowing
that acquiescence in present things is
their best security, will not be given to
change; and the King knowing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
indisposition to abet a change, will
have little occasion of jealousie. And
their mutuall confidence, which is the
strongest bond of peace, will lead them
without rub or let into a setled mutuall
happiness. But it is not good advice to
neglect a peoples interest, or to use
them with less regard, because they are
willing to hug their own peace in any
tolerable condition. The Soveraigns
greatness, and the peoples freedom,
are but one fabrick resting upon the
same fundamental constitution. If you
shake the one, you shake the other also.
I detest and abhorre the tumults and
insurrections of the people, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

wickedness proceed from the wicked.
But let none that seek a righteous end

extremities, before they would revenge
or defend themselves by unlawfull

let a wise Prince consider,
that the divine providence can by ways
without number change the face and
state of things, when a dissatisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious

                     <p>It hath been judged a Maxime in
Policy, that to head faction is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to one aspiring to soveraignty, but
not to one possessed of it. Also that to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61567:122"/>
uphold division is the way to subdue
a people, but not to hold them in firm
obedience, when subbu'd. <hi>Machiavel</hi>
shews the inconvenience that ariseth to
a Prince by holding a people under
his Government divided into factions,
because he will be inclined (as all by
nature are) to take part in any thing
that is divided, and to be pleased more
with this then with that party, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the other is discontented. And he
brings in a pertinent story, That in the
year 1501. a Gentleman sent by the
King of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> to cause re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of certain lost Towns to the
<hi>Florentines,</hi> finding in every one of
those Fortresses men, who, when they
came to visit him, said, that they were
of such a faction, much blamed their
division, saying, that in <hi>France,</hi> if one
of the Kings subjects should say he were
of the Kings party, he should be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
because such a speech would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
no less then that there were in the
Country people enemies to the King;
whereas the King willeth that all those
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61567:122"/>
Towns be his friends, and united with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
themselves. Let me rehearse the
Counsell of our late Soveraign to His
Majesty that now is—<hi>Take heed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betting
any Faction, or applying to any
publick discriminations in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
contrary to what is in your own
judgement, and the Churches well settled.
Your partial adhering as head to any one
side, gains you not so great advantages in
some mens hearts, who are prone to be of
their Kings Religion, as it loseth you in
others, who think themselves and their
profession first despised, then persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by you. Take such a course as may
either with calmnesse and charity quite
remove the seeming differences and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
by impartiality; or so order affairs
in point of power, that you need not to
fear or flatter any Faction</hi>—Now if the
case were such, that one party were the
Kings onely Confidents, and that the
other cannot be faithful to him upon
immutable grounds and reasons, then
policy would advise him so to order
things in point of power, that he need
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61567:123"/>
not fear nor flatter the adverse party.
But it is evident that the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
love the King, and Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and account themselves happy in
His Majesties clemency, allowing them
a just and inoffensive liberty in certain
matters of Conscience. It is also evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to all impartial Judgements, that
his Majesties calmness and charity may
remove the seeming differencies, and
offences on their part. They are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to comply with Episcopacy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
and Liturgy corrected; and
they preferre union by accommodation
before Toleration with Division.</p>

                     <head>Section XXXIX.</head>
                     <p>If it be obiected, that the King by
carrying an even hand between both
parties will insure neither, for both will
remain dissatisfied; I reply, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were of force, if the differences
must remain uncompounded, and the
parties publickly divided into two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
societies; but we lay this for a
ground-work, that these twain are to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61567:123"/>
be made one as to publick communion
in divine worship, and to an agreement
in one common interest relating both
to the Protestant Religion and to this
Kingdom, which His Majesties wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may accomplish by a prudent
disposing of those things which indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
belong to both, and wherein
they both agree; and in divers things
that are peculiar to this or that side, he
may gratifie the one and the other with
moderation, as when the favours
vouchsafed to the one are not injurious
to the others peace: In which case in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
here may remain men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
perswasions, but not of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
parties and interests. Besides, if
some on either hand should become
turbulent, and cry we will have all or
none, yet the greater number, yea the
main body of either side may be found
of calmer judgments and affections,
who together with a multitude of wise
and well minded persons that are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
between both perswasions,
would cause the violent ones to keep
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61567:124"/>
within bounds. And as many of those
passionate men as have any judgment
will discern, that they are without hope
of prevailing, and disadvantage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by opposing the common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and quiet of the Nation.</p>

                     <p>His Majesty is a great King, he is
King indeed, and reigns in great power
over a willing people. He hath in his
hands the joynt stock or common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the whole Nation, Neither
of these grand parties can subsist
without him; and this gives him assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that they are and must be both
his. It is manifest that his interest
hath gotten the preheminence over all
partial interests, as indeed it ought. For
if the Prince be not in this regard trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent,
he is ready to be laid low.
Wise men inform us, that a Prince by
adhering to one Faction, may in time
lift it up above his own Imperial inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
which will be forced to give way
to it as the lesser to the greater. And
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61567:124"/>
the prime leaders of the potent Faction
will sway more then the Prince himself.
They will become arrogant, unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and boundless in their ambitious
designes. It is observed of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Third of <hi>France,</hi> that he would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the League with the Princes
of his own Kingdome to root out the
Protestants, and after awhile the same
League was turned against him. A
Prince may be so intangled, that he
shall not know how to winde out of
those wayes wherein he hath so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himself; neither shall he be able
to turn himself to the necessity of his
own affairs as new accidents arise.
Then is a Prince truely potent when he
hath all particular Factions lying at his
feet, and can compel them to live in
peace with one another. This is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of our Soveraign Lord this day.
For he is alone, and there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
him, on whom the Nation can
have any stable dependance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let His Majesties high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be the <hi>primam mobile</hi> to carry
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61567:125"/>

                     <p>His Majesty hath gained his peoples
hearts, and is glorious in their eyes, and
by his continued clemency he will not
fail to hold them fast to himself. He
desires to govern well, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be well governed, and seek no
greater liberty. In some tender points
of Conscience they wait upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
and are willing to close with
uniformity, not in rigour, but in some
convenient latitude and relaxation:
There is an yielding that is no way ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but generous and advantageous,
a Princely condescention, whereby a
King becomes more absolute, and may
have what he will from his loving sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
And they will no less fear him
then love him, as knowing both his
goodness and his greatness. For he is
great indeed to whom the hearts of
three Nations are linked; and it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
impossible that so vast a people
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61567:125"/>
should at once be lost to a King who
continues to deserve well of them, and
to make them his favourites. And then

                     <p>There is a saying, which by many
hath been taken up for a proverb. <hi>No
Bishop, no King.</hi> I do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the rise of this saying, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dare not speak in derogation of
their judgments who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of it. But upon the matter it self, I
crave leave to make this modest Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adversion.
And first, it is some degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the transcendent interest of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
to affix unto it a necessity of any
one partial interest for its support: for
independency and self-substence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaning upon any Party, is a Prince
his strength and glory. Also it makes
that Party over-confident, and its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
too despondent. Such sayings
as import a Princes necessary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61567:126"/>
on any particular Party, may in
the mouths of subjects be too presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and in the mouth of a Prince too
unwary. But of this particular I dare
not so speak, in as much as I know not
its rise and reason. Only this I humbly
conceive, that the coalition of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
and Presbytery, sets forth a Bishop
in conjunction with Presbyters, of no
less dependence on the soveraign, and
of more influence on the people, then
a Bishop having sole jurisdiction can
have in the present age.</p>

                     <p>As concerning the Nobility and
Gentry of this Kingdom, who for the
greater part are said to favour Prelacy,
They cannot in reason be offended at
such a regulated Episcopacy, when they
shall behold its order and harmony,
and tendency to a general peace. It
seems agreeable to their Nobleness, to
affect a comely and venerable Order
in the Church for the honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And let them judge whether the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61567:126"/>
Worship of God be more holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
for those many Gesticulations
and various postures enterchangeably
used in parts of divine Service that are
of the same kinde, and require equall
Reverence. Whether a grave habit of
civil decency for a Minister, is less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in sacred Administrations then
certain other Vestments which some
scruple, as conceiving that holiness is
placed in them? Whether a Church
setled by limited Episcopacy, cannot
attain to its due veneration without the
Hierarchical dominion and splendor:
The reduction of absolute Prelacy to
Episcopal presidency here desired,
may concern the Nobility and Gentry
as well as others. For as others may
be oppressed, so these may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topped.
Excessive power is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised beyond their intentions,
that are eager to set it up. And they
that thought onely of crushing a party
offensive to them, may at length finde
themselves obnoxious, or at least neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and undervalued. On the other
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61567:127"/>
side, they have little cause to fear that
which is commonly so much dreaded,
namely the excessive rigour of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
from a president Bishop, and
grave Presbyters joyntly governing.
For it is supposed that no act of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
shall be exercised against or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Lawes of the Land, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made without consent of the
Nobles and Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <head>Section XLIV.</head>
                     <p>Let the Episcopal Clergy admit an
address to themselves touching their
own concernments: Peradventure they
either suspect or disdain the counsel of
one that may seem an adversary; but
whatever they apprehend, it is the
counsel of one who with his whole
heart desires that they may not miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who accounts them too precious to
belost to their brethren, if they will
permit themselves upon any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
tearms to be gained; who would
gladly walk with them by the same
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61567:127"/>
Rule in things received in common,
which are sufficient for Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and should be so acknowledged
by all that mind the things of Christ
more then their own things. Were I
a true hater of that Party, or a right
Phanatick, I should wish for their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
irruption upon the Presbyterians
even as vehemently as now I pursue
the design of peace; and I verily think
my reasoning, however it takes with
them, will convince them of my good
intention: if they decline moderate
counsels, and resolve to run high, they
may attain to a lofty standing; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they will always stand on a pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
In a little time they have greatly
inlarged their borders and lengthened
their cords; it were good that now they
should strengthen their stakes, and
make good their ground: By modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only can they be established.
Some may say in their hearts, <hi>The
bricks are fallen downe, but we will
build with hewen stones; the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores
are cut down, but we will change
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61567:128"/>
them into Cedars.</hi> Indeed their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is well known; nevertheless
let them consider their constant
strength, and accordingly limit their
hopes; for this is an high point of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Let them that have gotten a
victory use it wisely, and take care that
they lose it not in hope of a greater.
The issue of things oft times hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unfortunate to those that have
waxed insolent and unreasonable upon
unexpected successes. There is not a
greater errour then to refuse tearms of
Agreement that are profered by a
Party which cannot be rooted out,
but will be always considerable either
as friends or enemies, especially when
those tearms do comprise some part of
their victory that should accept them.
Let the Episcopal Clergy observe the
spirit of the Nation, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Times, that they may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehend the measure of their
own hopes. The English are a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nation, and as they delight in the
Majesty and Glory of their King, so
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61567:128"/>
also in the splendid condition of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Governours, that their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living be in some sort conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the dignity and opulency of the
Nation: Accordingly they seem to
take pleasure that the Ecclesiastical
State be upheld by a fair Revenue and
competent Dignity, yet with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For if the Clergy do rise to
Princely or Lordly wealth and power;
they may become the envy of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry: Let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
they stand by Grace, not by their
own strength, but by their Prince His
Favour. The Nation in general may
be taken with a grave and masculine
decency in all Sacred things sutable to
their spiritual Majesty; but I make a
Question whether in this noon-tide of
the Gospel they will fall in love with
excessive gaudiness, pompous shews,
and various affected gestures in Sacred
Administrations; and not rather esteem
them vanities too much detracting
from the dignity and purity of Gospel-Worship.
In this noon-tide of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61567:129"/>
Gospel the Bishops cannot magnifie
their Office but by other courses then
what were taken in former and darker
times. Meer formalities will no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
dazle our eyes: We shall think they
have work of an higher nature, then
to look only to the observation of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Forms, and Rites, ann Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
they must make a nearer approach
to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> practice in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Preaching of the Word, in the
strict observation of the Lords Day, in
keeping a true watch over the Flock,
and in correcting the real scandals that
break forth in mens conversations:
And if they walk in these paths, the
<hi>Prelatists</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will not be
far asunder. Perhaps the friends of
<hi>Prelacy</hi> may imagine, that in this coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
<hi>Presbytery</hi> may at length under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<hi>Episcopacy;</hi> but reason shews that
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> will stand more firm in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with <hi>Presbytery,</hi> then by it self
alone.</p>
                     <p>In the body natural there is some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
humour, as <hi>sanguine, chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61567:129"/>
melancholy,</hi> or <hi>phlegmatick;</hi> yet
none of these do subsist alone without
the mixture of the rest in a due tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament.
In like manner the Body Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
may be of several complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
or constitutions, as <hi>Episcopal,</hi> or
<hi>Presbyterial,</hi> according to the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
quality. Now if the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Churches would become more firm
and stable by the superintendency
of one grave President, (and the truth
is, in all <hi>Presbyteries</hi> there appeareth
some <hi>Episcopacy</hi> either formal or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al)
so an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church may be
judged more firm and stable by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
superintendency in consociation
with assistant <hi>Presbyters.</hi> And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the fear of the incroachments of
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> it is easie to discern, that
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> if it contains it self within
moderate bounds, will be always in
this National Church the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
quality.</p>

                     <p>The glorifying and pleasing of the
highest Potentate and universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and the eternal happiness of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
precious souls, are the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and blessed ends of Government.
Let his Majesties Reign be happy and
glorious in attaining these ends. A
Christian King esteems it the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his regal Power to hold and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it as the servant of Jesus Christ,
to be a Protector of the true Church,
the Body of Christ the Lambs wife,
for whose redemption Christ dyed, and
for whose gathering and perfecting,
the world is continued. It is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this true Church, to make the
holy Scriptures the perfect rule of their
faith and life, to worship God in spirit
and in truth, according to the power
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61567:130"/>
and spiritual worship of the Gospel, to
walk by the rule of the new Creature
in spiritual mortification and crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the world, to study holinesse in
sincerity, to strive to advance it in
themselves and others, and to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon others unto sound
knowledge, faith, humility, godlinesse,
justice, temperance, charity. The true
Church lies in the middle between two
extreams, Formalists and Fanaticks.
They are of circumspect and regular
walking, no way forward in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or desiring alterations in a civil
State. A Prince doth hold them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
under a double bond. For
they know they must needs be subject
not onely for wrath, but for conscience
sake. Indeed we will not conceal, that
in lawful wayes they assert that liberty
which is setled by the known Laws and
fundamental Constitutions, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
whereof is the Princ's as much
as the Peoples safety.</p>

                     <p>That being the happiest politie that
is founded in true Religion, and most
fully suited to mens everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
it greatly behoveth Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
to mark and avoid those things
which bring Religion into contempt,
and tend to the increase of Atheism and
infidelity. The many various Sects and
absurd opinions and fancies, and
pretended Revelations of these latter
times, have much lessened the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Religion in <hi>England.</hi> This is
a great evil, and much observed and
decryed by the present times. There is
another evil no less injurious to the
honour and estimation of Christian
piety, to wit, Ceremonial strictness
with real prophaness, or at the most but
lukewarmness in the real part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And this is the true state of the
Papacy, by occasion whereof Atheists
have so abounded in <hi>Italy. Machiavel</hi>
observes in his time, that Christianity
was no where less honoured then in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61567:131"/>
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the pretended Head
thereof. Let this evil be seen, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and remedied, that the sacred name
of the Church be given to a society not
carnal, but truly spiritual, according
to that of the Apostle, <hi>We are the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
which worship God in the spirit,
and rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no
confidence in the flesh.</hi>

                     <p>It is the preheminence of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
as General Bishop of the Land,
(for so He is in a political sence) to visit
His people of all ranks by His prudent
inspection: And it is worthy of His
chiefest care and search to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Sabbath teach them the good
Knowledge of God; what Pluralists
do seize upon several Congregations,
thrusting or barring out laborious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and leaving the sheep in the
hands of one who is a meer mercinary,
and careth not for them; whether
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61567:132"/>
Preaching in Cathedral Churches be
more frequent since the reviving of
Deans and Chapters then before, when
those places were supplied by one or
two stipendiary Ministers; whether
the Precincts of Cathedrals be the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
parts of the Land, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof the purest parts of the
Clergy, as in reason they ought to be.
In all His Majesties superintendency
there is nothing of greater moment, then
to provide that the Order and Frame of
Ecclesiasticks have not a tendency to
make the superior Clergy proud and
covetous, and the inferior poor and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>

                     <p>A good Constitution or Frame of
Ecclesiastical Politie is incomparably
more available to produce good effects,
then good Canons or good Governors
can be where the Constitution is
naught: For in such a state good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and good Governours will not be
able to reform abuses and correct scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61567:132"/>
and promote the true end of
Church Discipline.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Trent</hi>-Council the Papalins
or the Popes Creatures held this for a
maxime, <hi>That the Decrees of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could not diminish the profits of the
Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>as long as the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Apostolique See was not impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
The Council being ended, and the
Decrees coming to be ratified by the
Pope, and the Officers of the Court
representing their losses and prejudices
by the Ratification, and the Pope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
perplexed, and the Cardinals divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their Opinions, one <hi>Bishop,</hi> a
man well conversant in Court Affairs,
said, <hi>That he could not chuse but wonder
at this great fear, concerning the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Decrees, which he saw did arise
without reason; for that Lawes have no
power but what is given them by him that
Governeth; That the Pope by his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
might give them a larger or a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sence; yea, and contrary to that which
the words do import, That he might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
a particular Congregation for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61567:133"/>
the Council, and affectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
that none should be able to alleadge
the Decrees in prejudice of the Court.</hi>
The Pope was satisfied with these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
being perswaded that it would
fall out as the Bishop had said: And so
the Decrees of Reformation proved of
no effect to reform the enormities of
the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> By this it appears,
that new Laws and Decrees work little
where a corrupt Frame remaineth still
in force. If in such a state of things
good men promoted to Government
should do their utmost to rule well,
they are no more able to reform the
Churches committed to them, then the
two <hi>Cato's</hi> to reform the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
when it was wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and out of frame. Beside, in
a corrupt frame of Politie there are
these two great evils; the one, that
good men will soon degenerate; the
other, that bad men led by ambition
and avarice, will by Arts proper to the
times more easily get promotions: and
a good Prince shall see it and not know
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61567:133"/>
how to help it. That Politie, whether
Civil or Eccesiastical, is well consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
that in its frame is apt to bridle
humane desires; but that is ill consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
which lets loose the reins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.
No function or calling is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the corruption that is in
the world through lust. And the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of this world is not more peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to any then to Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="49" type="section">
                     <head>Section XLIX.</head>
                     <p>It is a singular excellency in any
frame of Politie, that the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good be very ample, and that a
power to hurt be as much contracted
and restrained as the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will permit: And verily no wise
and gracious persons would willingly
be tempted with a power to hurt, if
they be sufficiently impowered to do
good without it: Besides, it is an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
power, and makes the Office hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Now the way to this happy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of things is obvious. Let not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61567:134"/>
Lawes and Canons, concerning
things disputable and unnecessary,
which may insnare the consciences of
godly, orthodox and peaceable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
remain in force. The most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
assertors and rigid imposers of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
acknowledge, that they are
not necessary parts of Worship: the
declaring, That holiness is not to be
placed in them, is their best defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the charge of wil-worship. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to suspend and silence able and
painful Ministers, to vex and punish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
godly Christians that cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to those Ceremonies, is to procure
much evil without a benefit to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
it. A power of doing much harm
and little good, is unhappily placed in
any sort of men, but especially in
Christs spiritual officers, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Apostles words, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
authority from the Lord, for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and not for destruction.</p>

                     <p>The most renowned Polititian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61567:134"/>
that those Kingdoms, Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
and sects of Religions subsist
longest, that are often renewed or
brought back to their first beginnings.
For the beginnings of all these must
needs contain some goodness in them,
by means whereof they rise to their
first reputation and increase. Now in
process of time that goodness will be
overgrown by corruption; and unless
something happen to reduce it to the
just mark, those Societies must needs
be destroyed. And touching Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he proves these Reformations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
by the example of the Roman
Religion, saying,—<hi>If it had not
been reduced again to its principles by St.</hi>
Francis, <hi>and St.</hi> Dominick, <hi>it would
have been quite defaced. For these by their
poverty, and imitation of Christs life,
made a new impression thereof in mens
minds, which was quite blotted out thence,
and their new rules were so powerful, and
are now the cause that the dishonesty
of the Prelates and Heads of Religion do
not ruine it, partly by their living in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61567:135"/>
and partly by the credit they have
in confessing the people and preaching to
them.</hi>—Indeed this Author doth
not hit the mark, (and no marvel)
touching the true principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
and right imitation of Christ, the
reviving whereof he ascribes to those
two popish Saints; but his reason of
Religion in general is solid and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and his instances in particular are
right and sound, being applyed (as
they are) to the upholding of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Religion. As for Religion truly
Christian, the way to preserve it in its
power and glory, is frequently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to its first beginnings; for then
was its goodness most eminent. The
primitive spirit of the Christian Church
was a spirit of power and glory, and the
primitive order was most spiritual and
powerful. Let Christs holy Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
let Apostolical precept and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
be the pattern of our Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
What sound Protestant will deny
the holy Scriptures to be a perfect rule
of all divine Institutions? To them we
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61567:135"/>
appeal, by them would we stand or
fall; and they mention no Ministers of
the Gospel, that were not Bishops ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the flock. But in pursuance of
peace, touching the matter of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
the moderate Presbyterians are
willing to descend to the times lower
by one degree, and to come to the Ages
next following the Scripture-times,
and to accept what they do present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, to wit, a President-Bishop ruling
in consort with Presbyters, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
not of an other Order then Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
but of an higher degree in the
same Order. We appeal to those times
concerning this matter. And they that
admire and almost adore antiquity
should not deny our just appeal.</p>
                     <p>And wherein stands the power and
glory of the Church militant? Doth
it stand in the pompous shews of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
worship, with the glistering
furniture thereof, in the secular digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and jurisdictions of the higher rank
of Ecclesiasticks, in the implicite faith
of the Laicks, and in a formal unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61567:136"/>
in the outside of Religion? Or in
the powerful preaching of the Gospel
by able Ministers of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the lively and spiritual manner
of prayer, in the dispensation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
after a manner most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to the increase of knowledge, faith,
and virtue, in the exercise of discipline
to correct all contumacious disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
against the known laws of Christ
our King and Law-giver, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a comely order with a grave
and sober decency? Let all unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
minds give judgement; which of
these two different states of Religion
doth most express the Gospel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
which is called the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit, and is incomparably
more glorious and powerful, then the
Mosaical dispensation with all its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and visible splendor. Let them
also judge which of these two is most
conformable to the state of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, wherein the Christian
Church, not by an arm of flesh and the
wisdom of this world, but by weapons
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61567:136"/>
mighty through God, as the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
doctrine and discipline, the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of believers, the constancy of
Martyrs, overturned the Kingdom of
Satan, and advanced the Kingdom of
Christ, where Satans Throne was, in
opposition to the power of the Roman
Empire, the wisedom of the learned
Heathens, the counsels of Polititians,
the potency of ancient Customs, the
inveterate prejudice of all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and lastly, in opposition to the
Devil reigning and raging in them all.
Wherefore let us mind the true way
of restoring the Christian Religion to
its primitive power and glory.</p>

                     <head>Section LI.</head>
                     <p>It is a happy frame and order, when
things are setled for general satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that none or very few of the serious
people desire an alteration, but all, or
most of them dread it; as also when
things are setled for stability, that none,
who have a will to it, can encompass
an alteration. It is a happy thing to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61567:137"/>
light upon the way that leads to this
satisfaction, and to this stability. In
religion the way of general satisfaction
is not to gratifie the humour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of one or more parties, but to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the consciences of the judicious
and sober minded in general. For such
on all sides will sway most for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance;
and if they be satisfied, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and unquiet spirits would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be out of breath in their rash at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
Likewise the way of stability,
that none may succesfully project a
change, is to prevent mens running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
extreams on either hand. For when
one extream prevaileth, a change easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followeth. In this case it fares with
the Church as with civil States. A
principality heightened into Tyranny,
tumbles down into Anarchy, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
too much cherishing popular
extravagancies lifts up a tyranny. Now
the way to prevent extreams, is either
to chuse moderate spirits, or else a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
number of the opposite parties
to the managing of publick affairs. In
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61567:137"/>
which election a Prince doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
as a Neuter, but as a moderator
and true Governour, that hath the
command of all interests.</p>

                     <p>And now having pursued Peace to
the utmost of my small ability in these
pacifick Discourses, I hope this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
search after the knowledg of good
and evil in this kind will not be judged
an eating of the forbidden fruit, an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
and bold inquiry into things
not to be made known. For it is not a
curious or presumptuous intruding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Counsels of Princes, and secrets
of Government; but a modest and
sober deliberation upon things open
and manifest, and of publick inquisition
and discourse. Besides, it is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
time, wherein there are great
thoughts, yea great searchings of heart
in men of all degrees and all perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is true, that this Nation is not
erecting a new Kingdom, nor laying
new foundations of Government; yet
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61567:138"/>
it is no less true, that this restauration
is as it were life from the dead, and we
are in some sort beginning the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new.
It is a notable <hi>Epocha,</hi> or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of time, giving opportunity to cut
off excesses, to make up defects, and
to make crooked things straight, before
we be fixed and ingaged in particular
wayes, from which though never so
incenvenient, we may not be able to
draw back or turn aside. It is affirmed
by one of piercing knowledge in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of this nature, that it is a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
order in a Commonwealth, for any
one to propose what is for the publick
good. Surely the Kingdom cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by the proposals of the meanest
persons, when they touch not upon the
fundamental Constitution, nor disturb
publick peace and order. This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
offers no disturbance to such
Forms and Orders as have attained a
quiet stated posture in these times. The
Lawes have made some alteration in
things of former use and practice, as
the Act for abolishing the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61567:138"/>
The times have made more
alterations in mens minds and wayes;
and his Majesty hath observed a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or at least expediency of some alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
whereby the minds of men may
be composed, and the peace of the
Church established, declaring—<hi>That
he hath not the least doubt but the present
Bishops will think, that the Concessions
made by him to allay the present Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
are very just and reasonable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, The scope of this Treatise
doth justifie and defend it self, whereof
the bare narration is a full Vindication.
For the sum of the whole matter is to
perswade a turning from the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a partial Interest, and a turning
to the obvious and easie way of giving
general satisfaction to all those that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to
be a true Church, and are willing to
abide in her Communion.</p>
