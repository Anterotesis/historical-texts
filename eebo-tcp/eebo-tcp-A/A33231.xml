         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving lately, it may be later
than most men in <hi>England</hi> who
are inquisitive after Books, had
a view of a little Book (in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a Book of Yours which
I had not then seen) Intituled, <hi>Fanaticism
Fanatically Imputed by him (Dr.</hi> Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet)
<hi>to the Catholick Church;</hi> I
had read very few leaves in it, when I was
able warrantably to say, that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
was the Author of this Book; a person whom
I had long known, and familiarly conversed
with, before he was perverted in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
aud had often seen since; and upon the
whole I must confess (if there had not been
some particulars in it, which could not suffer
me to be deceived) I could hardly have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that so much pride, and bitterness,
<pb facs="tcp:48703:3"/>
and virulence could upon so little provocation,
and with so little excuse have dropped
from his pen. The <hi>confidence</hi> of it amazed
me, as much as the <hi>rudeness;</hi> and though I
could not expect that a man who had treated
his own Mother with so little respect, could
have much reverence for your Person, who
have so vigorously defended her, and fully
vindicated her from all the reproaches that
Classis of men have been able to cast upon her,
and exposed their malice and their ignorance
more nakedly to the view of the world, than
I think hath been ever done before, for
which all her true children are, and always
must be indebted to you, and to your memory:
I thought the little angry Book fit to receive
some answer, and the Author of it worthy of
reprehension and admonition, which he might
receive with less disturbance from an old
Friend; and I thought it likewise unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that you, whose studies are so wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed
by, and dedicated to the publick,
should be put to the trouble to free your self
from these feeble calumnies, which every
man who hath read your Works is able to do,
and every man who loves the Church, is
bound in justice to do: Besides, I was willing to
invite other <hi>Lay-men</hi> to shew with more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
their concernment for the Church, and
the Protestant Religion, so variously and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
<pb facs="tcp:48703:3"/>
assaulted on all hands, though God be
thanked impotently enough, that the defence
of it may not be looked upon as the sole duty of
the <hi>Clergy.</hi> These were the motives that
invited me to undertake this little task, which
I was not long performing, and yet even when
I had finished it (if so imperfect a draught can
be called finishing) I chanced to have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
sight of your Answer to several late Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I can with a very good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
assure you, that mine was dispatched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I did see it, and therefore, especially since
you have only taken a slight notice in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s waspish invectives, I
am willing, if you please, that my short Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions
may be likewise presented to his
view, which is intirely left to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or suppressed, or corrected according to
your judgment, by,</p>

FANATICALLY
Imputed to the Catholick Church,

And the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the wish, not the
hope of the most excellent
<hi>Lord Bacon</hi> in his never
enough admired <hi>Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning,</hi> that good
Books had the quality or
faculty of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Rod, that being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Serpent, eat up, and devoured the
other Serpents, which were produced by
the Rods of the Sorcerers or Magicians:
The number was so great in his time of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48703:5"/>
idle, and impertinent, and Seditious
Books, and the number of the Readers
who were delighted with them was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
so great, that Books of Learning,
weight and importance found little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and few Men at leisure to peruse
them, and he saw no remedy, but by such
a miracle: What would that great and
discerning Person think, if he had lived in
these days, when the licence of writing,
and publishing light and scandalous Books
of all Arguments, without any rules or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of modesty is grown the Epidemical
disease of the Nation, and a reproach to
the Government, in the violation of the
Laws, the contempt of the Magistrate,
and the general contagion that is spread
abroad, and threatens the very peace of
the Kingdom, at least disturbs the sober
conversation of it? The spirit of <hi>Martin
Marprelate,</hi> which hath for so many years
been expired, or extinguished, is revived
with greater insolence, and improved,
and heightned as well against the State,
as the Church in a petulancy of language,
in a style so new, and unbecoming Men of
honest education, that the gravest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Divinity it self, and Texts of the
Sacred Scripture are handled in a manner,
and fashion, and with such vain and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48703:5"/>
expressions, as have not used to be
admitted in the lightest arguments, or in
sober and chast mirth. The important
and vital parts of Government, the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Laws established, and even the
Person of the King himself, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Magistrates are arraigned, censured,
and inveighed against in such a bitterness
of words, with terms so reproachful, as
have not been ever used in good company;
and as if the <hi>English</hi> tongue were too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to comprehend all the Ribaldry and
filthiness of their thoughts and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they coin new words of contempt
and indignation, and make use of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
never heard of, but in the company of
Ruffians, and the lowest and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
of the People, which for wit sake
they apply to their vile purposes; so that
this extravagance (if not timely suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
doth really seem to threaten, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a general corruption of manners, but of
the purity, and integrity of the Language,
and of the good humor, and good nature,
and modest conversation of the Nation;
and upon this occasion I cannot but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the want of that caution and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which was heretofore observed,
when this unruly Spirit first broke out in
the time of <hi>Martin Marprelate,</hi> who had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48703:6"/>
a contribution of Jests, and Scoffs, and
Comical inventions brought to him, by
all the party who desired to expose the
Church and the Government of it, to the
contempt and scorn of the loose and rude
People. It was not thought worthy of
any serious Man to enter into the lists with
such adversaries, or to take notice of their
Pamphlets, but Men of the same Classis,
of the same rankness of Wit and fancy,
and of honester principles were the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
in that quarrel. <hi>Thom. Nash</hi> was as
well known an Author in those days, as
<hi>Martin,</hi> who with Pamphlets of the same
kind, and size, with the same pert <hi>Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry,</hi>
and with more salt and cleanliness,
rendred that libellous, and seditious crew
so contemptible, ridiculous, and odious,
that in a short time they vanished, and
were no more heard of. What was urged
or insinuated by any Men of discretion and
understanding, that might make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon sober, unwary, and misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Men, was carefully and learnedly
answered by Persons assigned to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that the Church, or the State might
not undergoe any prejudice by want of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
advice, without mingling any of
the others froth or dregs in their composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which they left to the chastisement
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48703:6"/>
of those who could as dexterously manage
the same weapons, and were fitter for their
company: And methinks grave and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men, or they who ought to be grave
and serious, should be afraid of imitating
such adversaries in their licence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
lest they should get into a scoffing
vein, which they should not easily shake
off, or lose their credit with worthy Men,
for dishonouring the cause they maintain
ironically.</p>
            <p>A man will hardly be thought provident
enough, or solicitous for his own peace,
and credit, who having discovered this
unruly frantick disease, will expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the malignity thereof, by approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so near the company of those angry
Wasps, and Hornets, who are like to be
willing to take any opportunity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon a Person, who hath presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be offended with their manner of
writing, and in the same instant, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his own to their censure, which is like
to be liable to as many exceptions of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and impertinence: To which I shall
only say, that whatever other faults they
shall discover in this short writing of mine,
they shall not find the same of which I
complain; I shall give no body ill words,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48703:7"/>
nor provoke them by contemning their
Persons; and I chuse rather to be at their
mercy, than not to endeavour the best
way I can to divert men from that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
way of reviling each other; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of answering Arguments, to traduce
the Persons who urge them. Truth is of
so tender, and delicate a constitution, that
it is defiled by rude handling; and hath
advantage enough to encounter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
its adversaries, by the vigour of its
own beauty, without aspersing the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the other, farther than unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
reason makes it manifest: I shall not
interpose in those Arguments, which are
now most agitated in that scurrilous style
that I complain of, but chuse to take upon
me to make Animadversions upon a Book
lately published, at least lately come to my
sight, Intituled, <hi>Fanaticism Fanatically
imputed to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>by Doctor</hi>
Stillingfleet, <hi>and the imputation Refuted
and Retorted by</hi> S. C. The Author where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
professes himself an avowed Enemy to
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and would be
thought as much an enemy to the foul cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
introduced into the Controversies
concerning it, and the liberty men assume
to deride Religion instead of vindicating
it; to wound the profession, by a petulant
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48703:7"/>
and scornful mention of the Professors;
and by expressions full of pride and vanity,
and destructive to peace and government:
and yet how contrary soever this way of
writing is to his practice and inclination;
he hath some jealousie of himself, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the insupportable provocation he hath
received, some phrases of bitterness may
have scaped his Pen, which he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he hath very good authority not to
make any excuse for, and there being such
plenty of that noisom Gall scattered
throughout his whole discourse, it will be
but just to take a view of his provocation,
and whether his revenge be no more than
proportionable to the occasion, and then
whether the imputation be not rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
retorted, than reasonably refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and whether in the endeavoring the
one or the other, the bounds and limits of
all modesty and civility are not so far trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed,
that the Author is liable to just
censure.</p>
            <p>I do the rather enter into the List upon
this occasion, because I may infallibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
that I know the Author of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
for I no sooner read it, which
was long after it was published, but that
it was manifest to me by many particulars
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48703:8"/>
contained in it, in which I cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that it is written by Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi>
with whom I have been acquainted very
near fifty years, and have very long
esteemed him for his parts, and learning,
and for his good nature, and his good
manners, all of which were in as great
perfection then, as they have been ever
since, or are at present; and therefore as I
shall treat him with that candor that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an old Friend, so I do not suspect
his reception, and interpretation of it will
be such, as is worthy of that temper of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which he professes to be of; nor do I
despair of presenting some considerations
and reflections to him, which may so
work upon it, as to induce him to believe,
that both in regard of the matter it self,
and the manner of treating Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi>
he hath swarved very much from
those Rules which he prescribes to others,
and pretends to observe himself, and then
the tenderness of his own Conscience will
instruct him what reparation he ought to
make.</p>
            <p>But before I enter into the debate, I
must first declare, that the Religion I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and defend, is the Religion of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> and not the particular
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48703:8"/>
opinions, much less the expressions of any
member of it, how worthy soever: and
Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> who professes to be an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to it, ought to insist only upon what
is owned, and avowed by her, and not
hope to wound her through the sides, or
by the weakness or passions of those who
have deserted her, or still adhere to her:
And in the second place, that I do not take
upon me to write against the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> of which the <hi>Church of England</hi>
is a vital part; or against the Religion
professed in any <hi>Catholick Country,</hi> but
against the <hi>Roman Catholick Subjects</hi> of his
Majesties Dominions; whose Religion I
take to be different from that, which is
professed and established in any <hi>Catholick
Country</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> and disavowed by all
the <hi>Catholick Countries</hi> out of <hi>Europe.</hi> And
one of the principal reasons that engages
me in this Discourse, is to endeavour to
draw the dispute that is between the
<hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Laws of England,</hi> and his
Majesties Subjects of his own Dominions
who profess to be of the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a narrower room, and within that
compass that properly contains it: And I
have always thought that they have had
too much countenance, and too great a
latitude allowed them, in reducing the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48703:9"/>
contest to what concerns all the members
of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> equally with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as if the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
withdraw their obedience from the
<hi>Kings authority,</hi> and oppose the <hi>Laws of
the Land,</hi> so much to the damage of their
Estates, and the danger of their lives, if
the Laws were prosecuted against them,
only for the support, and in the defence
of the cause common to all other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks:
Whereas I say, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us depends wholly upon the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> within the <hi>Kings
Dominions,</hi> which is an argument never
used for the support of the <hi>Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
if it were, all Catholicks must be of
the same opinion. It was that, and that
only that first made the Schism, and still
continues it, and is the ground of all the
animosity of the <hi>English Catholicks</hi> against
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and produced their
separation from it; and if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all that personal authority in the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and any obedience to it within his
Majesties obedience (which I say again is
not admitted in any other Catholick King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
they will purge themselves of all
such jealousie, or suspicion of their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as may prove dangerous to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and against which the Laws are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48703:9"/>
their opinions of <hi>Purgatory</hi> or
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> would never cause their
<hi>Allegiance</hi> to be suspected, more than any
other error in Sence, Grammar or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
if those opinions were not instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their dependance upon another Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
foreign, and inconsistent with
their duty to the <hi>King,</hi> and destructive to
the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> and in that
sence and relation the Politick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdom takes notice of those
opinions, which yet are not enquired into
or punished for themselves; let them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
that, and they will find themselves
at great ease.</p>
            <p>This is the only Argument I wish should
be insisted on between us and our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subjects
of the <hi>Roman profession;</hi> not that I
think that the other Doctrinal points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Churches are not worthy
the insisting upon, but that as much hath
been said already upon them on both sides,
and as convincingly as is necessary: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
new can be added, at least no man
will be convinced with what shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
who is not moved with what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said; nor doth the meer difference
upon any of those points naturally produce
that uncharitableness, those animosities of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48703:10"/>
which we complain towards each other:
No man was ever truly and really angry
(otherwise than the warmth and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of words in the dispute produced
it) with a man who believed <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
more than he would be with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
who should come into a room
where he was reading by a Candle, and
swear that the room was so dark that he
could not see his hand; but when he will
for the support of this <hi>Paradox</hi> introduce
an authority for the imperious determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, that the Word of God hath
not commanded men to submit to, and
the word of Man, the Law of the Land
hath positively forbidden them to submit
to, it is no wonder if passion breaks in at
this door, and kindles a Fire strong enough
to consume the House. This is the Hinge
upon which all the other controversies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, and the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks do
so intirely hang and depend, that if that
only were taken off, all the rest would
quickly fall to the ground; and therefore
it concerns Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> and the rest of his
friends to fasten, and make that Hinge
strong, that it may support the rest from
falling: And I cannot but observe how
unwillingly they are brought to touch this
point, or if they do, it is so lightly, as if it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48703:10"/>
were too hot for their fingers; and upon
the necessity of a through examination of
this material Argument, I shall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to inlarge in the Conclusion of this
Discourse.</p>
            <p>There is another reason that hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
invited me to this unequal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
that is, my Zeal to the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> and a compassion of the very ill
condition it is reduced to, by an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
conspiracy, that was never before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into, against it, or any other <hi>establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Church,</hi> in undervaluing whatsoever is
written by any <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> how learned
and vertuous soever in defence of it; as if
he were a party, and spoke only in his own
interest, so that they who would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it, by all the foul and dishonest arts
imaginable, have the advantage to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as Persons engaged in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
meerly and purely by the impulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Consciences, and for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of such dangerous errors, as are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the Souls of men; whilst they
who are most obliged, and are best able to
refute those vain and malicious pretences,
and to detect the fraud and the ignorance
of those Seditious undertakers, are looked
upon as men not to be believed, at least
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48703:11"/>
partial, and that all they say is said on
their own behalf. This is a sad truth, and
a new Engine to make a Battery, at which
<hi>Atheism</hi> may enter without opposition,
with all its instruments and attendants,
that would make <hi>Christianity</hi> it self ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that it may be contemptible. God
forbid that this Scarcrow should impose si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon, or seal up the mouths of any
Learned and worthy <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> who
should open them the wider for this combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and contribute the more to the
assistance and vindication of the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Church in the world, because it
is in a distress by mockers, and scoffers,
and neutral or unconcerned persons, who
make the approaches, and sap the ground
to open the way, and make the access the
more easie, for more declared Enemies to
oppress and destroy it. This hath been a
motive to me, who have neither depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon, or relation to any <hi>Clergy-man,</hi>
nor any temptation to imbark my self in
this quarrel; but my love of truth, and
the most abstracted duty to my Country;
and likewise because I think, though the
<hi>Clergy</hi> is best able to judge of any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in matters of Religion, the <hi>Laity</hi> is
equally engaged in the consequences
which will inevitably attend any prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48703:11"/>
it shall undergo, or be exposed to, and
therefore ought in time to contribute their
talent towards the securing it, and not
stand idle spectators of those stratagems
which are no less designed against the
State, than the Church.</p>
            <p>In the last place, the particular esteem
I have of the profound Learning and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> (to whom I am
very little known) and his great merit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (whose wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Champion he will not be thought the
less, for the untrue aspersions Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
hath presumed to cast upon him, and
which will easily be wiped off) hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
me to interpose in his Vindication,
which is so much due to him from other
Men, that I wish he may not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with it. And having now observed
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s own method, in giving first
account of the reasons and motives which
have prevailed with me for this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for which I cannot alledge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that was most powerful with him,
obedience to certain friends, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
he ought in no wise to resist, since
I may honestly declare, that no Friend I
have is privy to my purpose, or knows
what I am doing: I make hast to wait
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48703:12"/>
upon him by his own stages, and shall
make no excuse for not affixing my name
to what I write, which I do purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
not by the example of <hi>S. C.</hi> but by
the assurance I have, that the publishing
my name would be so far from bringing
any advantage to the cause for which I am
solicitous, that it would rather increase
and propagate the prejudice that is against
it. I do therefore provide a more natural
countenance to support it; and which le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
will supply the defect of the name,
by having it Licensed by lawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without which it shall never be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
            <p>IF Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath in truth cast
any contemptuous aspersions upon
Mr. <hi>Cressy;</hi> or if he hath suffered any scorn
or calumny, only for recommending to
devout Christians, instructions for the
practice of Christian vertues, and piety in
the greatest perfection that this life is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of: If he hath selected the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
things and Persons in the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> on purpose to be contaminated
with his Ink full of Gall and Poyson, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
administring new Arms to <hi>Atheists:</hi> If
he hath endeavoured to shew, that all the
Religion professed in the World, and that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48703:12"/>
thing that bears the name of a <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> for so many Ages before the time of
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> was nothing for their
<hi>Worship</hi> but <hi>Idolatry;</hi> for their <hi>Devotions</hi>
but <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and for their <hi>doctrine</hi> and
<hi>discipline,</hi> nothing but <hi>faction, ambition,</hi>
and <hi>avarice:</hi> And if the Doctor hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his talent of reasoning upon these
subjects, to discharge his excess of spleen
and choler, and to give free scope to all
unchristian, and even inhumane passions,
(with all which the three first Pages do
confidently and directly charge him) I
must confess that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will not only
be excusable for any Zeal and confidence
he shall express against such an adversary,
but that the Doctor hath neither direction
or authority from the <hi>Church of England</hi> in
either of the particulars, nor would I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to vindicate him from that great
guilt. But if nothing of all this be true,
and if the Doctor hath neither said or done
any thing of this with which he is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> shall but comply with his
obligations in seriously considering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath observed St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>Let all bitterness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 31.</note> 
               <hi>and wrath, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and clamour, and evil speaking be put
away from you, with all malice.</hi> And of
the greater importance any controversie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48703:13"/>
is, especially if it hath any relation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the swarving from that rule can
never be dispensed with, and therefore it
will be proper in the first place to examine
the evidence that is to prove this charge,
or charges against the Doctor, before we
consider the three Imputations, by which
it is said he would fright men from the
Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or
the other three Retorsions by which
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is confident to wound the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches,</hi> upon both which, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
will be made in the proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Though I am no stranger to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> but have read, I
think, all that he hath published, at least
all that I have seen of his; and as I always
admired the strength and vigour of his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination,
and the clearness of his style
and expressions (a faculty not natural to
all very Learned and pious men) by which
he renders the most difficult points, and
which are usually by others wrapt up in
obscure terms, plain and intelligible to
vulgar understandings: So I have been
exceedingly delighted with the softness,
gentleness and civility of his language,
(which can never flow from an insolent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48703:13"/>
or proud spirit) in which he represents
things, which in themselves are light,
and as such might be neglected, in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
not reproachful manner; a dialect
his adversaries are not acquainted with:
And when he is compelled to answer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
or rather Allegations full of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness
and reproachful words, which
would tempt another to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they are liable to, with some sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
he passes by the provocation, and
collects what can possibly be found like
reason, out of what is alledged, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
it with very much less severity than
the matter would justifie, and seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to require. Yet knowing Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
well too, and that he is not of a quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
disposition, or apt to give ill words
in his discourse, and to have a full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of what he reads, that cannot be
imposed upon; I had some fear that the
Doctor had upon some great provocation
exceeded his former limits he had prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to himself, and retorted the language
of his adversaries with a bitterness natural
enough for them, though not to him:
And that temper I wished might never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from him; and therefore I was in
some pain till I could procure the Doctor's
Book that had raised so much passion in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48703:14"/>
Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> and which I had not seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
But when I had carefully read those
places to which the exceptions were made,
and examined as well as I could the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
or implication of every word; I
begun to suspect that I was mistaken in my
former conjecture, and that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> was
not the Author of that Imputation Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but when I again reflected upon the
reasons which had first produced that
judgment of mine, I found they had still
the same strength, and had then nothing
to hope, but that his obedience to those
Friends, whose commands he ought in no
wise to resist; for the writing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
his discourse, had prevailed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with him to publish it in their, and
not his own words, and I shall hereafter
give Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> a warrantable reason, why
I am still of the same opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first thing Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>lays to his
charge is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> That he accuses the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> which he says no
man ever presumed to do before; and that
he hath written an invective against the
life and prayer of Contemplation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and practised only in the <hi>Catholick
Church;</hi> it being a state which from the
infancy of the Church <hi>(he says)</hi> hath
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48703:14"/>
been esteemed the nearest approaching to
that of glorified Saints; <hi>and the evidence
that he produces to make this charge good
is,</hi> That the Doctor that he might make
an entrance into the invective with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grace, hath produced on his Stage an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquely
dressed, the famous Teachers and
erecters of Schools for Contemplation,
<hi>S. Bennet, S. Romaulde, S. Bruno, S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,
S. Dominique,</hi> and <hi>S. Ignatius,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them to the derision of prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
for which he threatens him shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon an Epigram in the Margent out of
<hi>Martial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before he proceeds farther in his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
lest the Doctor may be too much
exalted with the novelty of his invention
of his prophanely imployed Wit; he doth
assure him <hi>that he hath heard that kind of
Wit before, when he was a young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in</hi> Oxford, <hi>in a repetition Sermon to
the University, which,</hi> he says, <hi>if fancy
be alone considered, far better deserved
applause, wherein the Preacher descanting
upon the whole life of our Saviour, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him and his attendants, men and
women, objects of the utmost scorn and
aversion, as if they all of them had been
only a pack of dissolute vagabonds and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48703:15"/>
cheats: But presently the Preacher chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his stile, as became a Disciple of
Christ, with such admirable dexterity,
and force of reason, answered all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villations
and invectives made before, that
the loudly repeated applause of his hearers
hindered him a good space from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Notwithstanding which the grave
Doctors and Governours of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though much satisfied with his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yet wisely considering that a petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi>
Histrionical stile, <hi>even in objections,
did not fit so sacred a subject, and that it
was not lawful too naturally to personate
a</hi> deriding Jew, <hi>obliged the Preacher to a
publick</hi> recantation-Sermon <hi>in the same
Pulpit the Sunday following.</hi> To which
pretty tale I should make no reply, since in
the judgment of no dispassioned man, it
cannot be thought to be parallel to any
thing the Doctor hath said or done: Yet
I shall endeavour to convince Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi>
that his memory hath not been faithful to
him, in preserving the merit of that case
and sentence, and shall give him cause to
believe that I was likewise present at that
Sermon, by putting him in mind that it
was preached by one Mr. <hi>Lushington,</hi> a
man eminent for his parts, upon those
words in the Evangelist; <hi>And his Disciples
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48703:15"/>
came and stole him away whilst we slept:</hi>
Which gave him occasion to help the
Souldiers in their defence, in which he
gave them leave to use some light expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against the witnesses for the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
which were not decent upon that
subject; but that part was quickly ended,
when he put into the mouths of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
to whom he likewise assigned a
part, words very worthy of them, and fit
to be uttered in that place, and with
which the gravest Auditors were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
satisfied, though they were displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with some light and scandalous expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in some other parts of the Sermon:
Which he begun with <hi>qu' elle Novelle,</hi> as
if he came thither to ask and hear News;
but under favour of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s memory,
nothing of this was the ground of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or his Recantation; but a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
being then sitting, the <hi>Preacher</hi> had
unwarily, and very unnecessarily let fall
some words which reflected upon <hi>their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi>
particularly that now every <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in Parliament,</hi> by the priviledge of his
Vote there, cared not how he behaved
himself towards <hi>the King,</hi> or <hi>the Church,</hi>
or to that effect; which made those who
loved him best, willing to censure him
there, that he might escape a harder judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48703:16"/>
in another place: Whereupon the
<hi>Vice Chancellor,</hi> who was Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a copy of the Sermon, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered and perused by <hi>him,</hi> and a
<hi>Delegacy</hi> of the <hi>Doctors,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lushington</hi>
was reprehended for the light and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
expressions he had used upon a subject
too much above those excesses; and was
ordered to make a <hi>recantation Sermon</hi> for
what he had said of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and
had a Text likewise given him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
the words concerning the <hi>Apostles</hi>
in that of the <hi>Acts, And they assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with one accord in one place:</hi> Which
Recantation he performed with great inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
and much applause. If these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
recollections do not induce Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
to concur in the truth of the relation, I
doubt we shall find few equal Arbiters to
determine the difference between us; for
this Sermon, if I am not very much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
was preached in <hi>April</hi> 1624. or 25. of
which I believe that there be not many
surviving Auditors besides Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and
<hi>my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place let us examine how
the Doctor came to provoke Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> by
laying this grievous charge of <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48703:16"/>
upon many members of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> and to charge the Church it self
to be guilty of giving too much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to it: Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> confesses that the
first occasion was given him, by charging
the <hi>Church of England</hi> with <hi>Fanaticism;</hi>
which is sure as new a charge upon that
Church as it can be upon the other,
which he is so far yet from retracting, that
he still justifies it, by there being so many
<hi>Fanaticks</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi>
whereas he knows there is no <hi>Fanatick</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> or in any <hi>other Country,</hi> who
doth not avow a particular malice, and
displeasure against the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
and if he doth not, he is no <hi>Fanatick.</hi>
There can be nothing more contrary to
<hi>Fanaticism,</hi> than the order, and discipline,
and steddiness of the <hi>Church of England:</hi>
And it is not ingenuously nor generously
done of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> to charge that Church
with inclining to, and favouring an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that he knows hath rebelliously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
her, and would destroy her: He
would not think it just, nor indeed would
it be honest, to charge the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
of inclining to, or favouring of <hi>Iudaism,</hi>
because many <hi>Iews</hi> live there: And yet
the publick liberty and protection they
have in their allowed Synagogues, where
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48703:17"/>
they must both renounce, and contemn,
and blaspheme the Person of our Saviour,
is a greater argument of inclination, and
of favour, than can be charged upon the
<hi>Church of England</hi> towards any <hi>Fanaticks;</hi>
all whom it doth heartily desire to convert
or to remove out of its limits. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
and untrue reproach, made it
necessary for the Doctor to answer, and
refell that calumny, and as reasonable to
instruct Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> that his own Church is
much more liable to that accusation, than
the other: And why this provocation
should be so innocent an assault for the one,
and the defence by the other should prove
so heinous an offence, will require an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Judge to determine; who will
likewise discover which of them doth most
discover his excess of spleen and choler,
or gives most scope to all unchristian, and
even inhumane passions: And he cannot
but observe the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s commendable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
that he would not give himself
leave to retort the monstrous aspersion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own Mother, without very exactly
setting down the particular instances of the
ground of that his Retorsion, without any
other sharp language than is unavoidable
in the mention of the matters of fact; a
method Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> doth warily decline in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48703:17"/>
his bitterness towards his <hi>native Church;</hi>
nor do I blame him, for being so much
displeased with the length of the <hi>Doctors</hi>
discourse of that subject, nor for his so
slightly answering those particulars of
which he takes notice, and undervaluing
the rest, rather than go about to answer
them, of which it will not be possible to
avoid speaking more particularly anon;
and in the mean time I believe more of his
<hi>Catholick,</hi> than of his <hi>Protestant Friends</hi> do
heartily wish that the task had been impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon him, to answer the points in
controversie between the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
and the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and that the Doctor's
pleasant fourth Chapter had been left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
to those who will needs be read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Books; than that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
zeal on the behalf of so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
a number of Saints and Miracles
(which are very rarely particularly urged
by the learned <hi>Catholick writers</hi> in defence
of their doctrine) should invite men far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to examine those records, which the
Church it self hath given so many orders to
reform.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> finds himself most concerned
to vindicate the honour and the sanctity of
<hi>S. Benedict</hi> from the Doctors contumelious
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48703:18"/>
imputations; which contumelious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and whether the weight and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the vindication be answerable to
the zeal, will be next examined, and the
examination will be the shorter, because
he will leave the other Saints to answer for
themselves, but is obliged, in respect of
the publick interest that obliges the whole
<hi>Western Patriarchate,</hi> and especially <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to be tender of the honour of S. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
by whose disciples, if they were</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,
he says, Christianity <hi>hath been
established amongst us; and in veneration to
whom, such a world of</hi> Religious Houses
<hi>and</hi> Churches <hi>have been erected, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with vast possessions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cannot without renouncing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as a</hi> Christian Religious man, <hi>and an</hi>
English man, <hi>conspire to his dishonour by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi>
whereas probably silence would
have been the more seasonable vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and truly I have no mind to rake into
the ashes of a Person whom I believe to
have been a <hi>devout man</hi> in a <hi>dark time,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his talent of understanding,
and who hath been so long since dead; nor
do I believe the Doctor had inclination to
have made that scrutiny, if it had not been
made necessary to him, by a very unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
reproach; and the more Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48703:18"/>
enlarges upon that argument, the more
he will be offended on the behalf, because
he is in love with his own mistakes; else
he could not tell us that <hi>Englands Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
was established by the <hi>Disciples</hi> of
S. <hi>Benedict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there is some evidence, and for
ought I know it may be true, that we owe
our <hi>glass windows,</hi> and our <hi>warmer habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to one of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Bennet,</hi> who was an <hi>Abbot</hi> here, and
is a <hi>Saint</hi> too; who having made many
journeys into <hi>Italy,</hi> when he returned last
from thence, brought with him Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects,
who taught our people to build
Houses with Stone, which till then were
rarely seen, the habitations being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in Houses made of Earth, nor was
there till his time any <hi>glass windows</hi> seen in
<hi>England:</hi> All this may be true, and there
are several Authors aver it, but Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
very well knows that <hi>Christianity</hi> was
planted with us many hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the birth of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and we may
reasonably believe by the <hi>Roman Records,</hi>
to which we are more beholding for those
testimonies than to our own, and which
are in truth as full and clear, as in any
other matter of fact in that first Age, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48703:19"/>
it was sooner planted in <hi>Britain,</hi> than it
was at <hi>Rome it self;</hi> for if <hi>Ioseph of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
did come into <hi>England</hi> in the last year
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> it was before S. <hi>Peter</hi> ever
was at <hi>Rome.</hi> Sure it is that there was no
<hi>Monastery</hi> built in <hi>England,</hi> according to
S. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s rules, till near the year <hi>Six
Hundred,</hi> so that there is no reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that he, or his Disciples plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Christianity</hi> with us.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will be offended with all
men who examine the miracles of S. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi>
as they are mentioned by S. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
or in the lives of the Saints, with less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
than he himself considers them,
he will have as many quarrels with <hi>Roman
Catholicks,</hi> as with <hi>Protestants;</hi> since
there are very few of them of his talent of
learning and understanding, who give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to one of one hundred of those which
are mentioned to have been done, though
they are all willing, (how piously they
shall do well to consider) the <hi>Women,</hi> and
the <hi>weaker People</hi> should believe them all;
nor doth the less serious discoursing of
them in any degree reflect upon the honour
of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> or of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> himself,
much less imply that they were guilty of
lying against the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> for S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48703:19"/>
gives no other testimony of those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
than that he was informed by <hi>four
men</hi> who are named by him, and who had
conversed much with the Saint, that they
were true; nor doth it appear that the
<hi>Saint himself</hi> did own or avow the having
done those miracles, which are imputed to
him by other men; so that if they should
in truth be but <hi>pretended miracles,</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
they cannot be imputed to either of
them as <hi>sleights of Legerdemain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, take them all to be true, as
they are reported, most of them may be
proved to be no miracles; for if it was
only the Nurses <hi>Sieve</hi> that she had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of a Neighbour to winnow her Corn,
which was broken in two pieces, as Saint
<hi>Gregory</hi> reports, a youth without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
might joyn them together, to wipe
off his Nurses tears. Indeed if it was an
Earthen-pot, that with the fall broke into
a hundred pieces (as the Author of the
Lives of the Saints declares it to be) it was
a harder work for a little boy to put them
together again. And if he did after three
years such austerity in a Cave, and such a
spare diet as the cure kept him to, find it
necessary to roll himself in thorns to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
his amorous passions, the miracle is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48703:20"/>
rather in the novelty of the invention, than
in the cure it wrought: Nor doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be confirmed by the practice of any
of his Disciples since, who probably may
have been liable to the same temptations.
He doth very well to pass over all the
other instances the Doctor gives of the
same nature, except his being spectator of
the Soul of his sister <hi>Scholastica</hi> (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a subtiler sight than any other Saint
ever pretended to) nor will I mention any
of the rest, not so much as the Crow that
buried the poysoned piece of bread, which
by the way was a miracle on the <hi>Crows
part,</hi> more than on the <hi>Saints:</hi> I say I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mention any more of them, lest I
should be much less serious in it than the
Doctor hath been; for which I will only
make this excuse, that if Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will
call to him any three friends, who have
been bred in as good company as he hath
been, and let them together read S. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s,
in the Lives of the Saints, and if at
least one of them be not as pleasant upon it,
and believes as little of it, as the Doctor
seems to do, I will ask his pardon for being
less serious than he would have me upon
such occasions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48703:20"/>
I think the Doctor may lawfully and
reasonably suspect the truth of most of
those miracles which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> seems to
believe, and conclude the falshood of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, without denying that any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were wrought by God's servants in
that Age; nor will he be scrupulous in
denying that he hath met with many, or
any learned and prudent men, who have
been eye-witnesses of many, and deserve
to be believed. It is a wonderful thing
that when God himself never wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in the Old or New Testament, nor
ever any qualified by him to that purpose,
but it was to some visible purpose to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
his power and glory, and always by
persons eminent in his favour, and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and imployed by him in his particular
service, and then that the miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
those <hi>arcana imperii,</hi> were always
exposed to the view and examination of
those natural senses which God hath given
men to judge by, of what they see and
hear. If <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>rod</hi> had not produced
the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and that <hi>Serpent</hi> had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
the <hi>other Serpents</hi> which the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
rods had brought out in the sight of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> so that they
could not but confess, that they saw the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48703:21"/>
rod and the Serpent, and the execution it
did, and then that it returned again to be
a rod; God would not have blamed <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
for not believing any thing that <hi>Moses</hi>
had said to him. If the guest at the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
feast had not drank the first Wine,
and seen the empty pots filled again with
Water, and found the Wine poured out
of those pots of Water to be better than the
Wine that they had formerly drank; we
should never have heard any mention of
that miracle. They who were raised by
our Saviour or his Apostles from the dead,
were seen dead by a multitude of the
people, and some of them buried, and
were by the same people seen alive again,
and conversed with by them. The Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Resurrection, and Ascension of
Christ's, the chief evidences upon which
Christianity is founded, were the object
of the sight of witnesses enough, who
proved what they had seen: Nor was
there any one miracle that the senses of any
men could contradict to be any thing but
what they seemed to be: And can
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> be angry with us for not giving
credit to a mass of Miracles, most of which
are said to be wrought many hundred
years before they were heard of, and by
men who we are not sure ever were in this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48703:21"/>
world, since we do not meet with their
names in any other History, at least whose
vertues were never heard of but by their
miracles, nor their miracles proved but by
their vertues. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> well knows,
that the Church hath been so oppressed
with the numbers of them, and so scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
at the matter of them, that by its
special order and direction they have been
several times purged, and many of them
rejected for the folly and impossibility of
them; and the last purgation was made by
the Jesuit <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> who is the Author of
the Lives of the Saints to which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
refers, and was Chaplain to <hi>King Philip</hi>
when he came into <hi>England</hi> to marry
<hi>Queen Mary;</hi> and upon the experience he
got there, he undertook to write the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of England</hi> for twenty years, which
whosoever shall read, may very reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
take it to be a <hi>History of Spain,</hi> since
he shall neither find the names of persons,
or any transactions of which he ever heard
before; and therefore it may be reasonably
thought, that he had no extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in writing Histories, and that he
had no better evidence of the miracles he
hath preserved the memory of, than of
those which were rejected out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Legendaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48703:22"/>
That we may know that many good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
writers (for I shall only cite such
evidence against Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>) mention such
miracles, to which he is so solicitous to
have due reverence paid, as negligently
as the Doctor hath done; I shall set down
the Animadversion which is given us by
the best Catholick Historian of the Civil,
together with the Ecclesiastical transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that I think is extant in any language,
<hi>Monsieur Mezeray</hi> in his own words:
<q>The <hi>German</hi> Monks of this time (says
he) as it is the <hi>Genius</hi> of men to fain mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
always in great dangers, tell us,
that S. <hi>Uldrick</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> who
accompanied <hi>Otho</hi> the <hi>second Emperor</hi> of
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> in his expeditions of
War, passed the River <hi>Aisne</hi> dry-foot,
and made himself the example for <hi>Otho</hi>
and all his Army to follow; the waters
which had overflowed their Banks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
miraculously solid under their
feet, and the River serving for a Bridge
to itself.</q> It is very true this miracle is not
inserted in the Life of that Saint, the <hi>Bull</hi>
of whose <hi>Canonization</hi> is the first that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the <hi>first Tome</hi> of the <hi>Bullarium,</hi> and
was granted in the year 993. and there can
be no reason why that miracle was left out,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48703:22"/>
since another is there recorded, as the
principal inducement to his <hi>Canonization,</hi>
of the vindicative humour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
which is more wonderful; for it says, that
as <hi>Uldrick</hi> was going to repose himself,
S. <hi>Afra</hi> a Martyr of <hi>Ausburgh</hi> appeared to
him with a Vermilion countenance, and
took him out into the fields, where he
found S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was sitting amongst
a multitude of Saints, who demanded ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God against those who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
them, and they cried out especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
against <hi>Armenulphus Duke of Bavaria,</hi>
who was then living, and had demolished
many Churches and Monasteries, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their Revenues to <hi>secular persons,</hi> and
<hi>Armenulphus</hi> was condemned by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all those Saints. Is it not pity that
the other of passing the River, if it had
not been too much talked of, was not
made use of to have contributed to that
Canonization? Because I do not intend to
grieve Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> any more upon his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
throughout his Book, except I may
be thought obliged to it; I will only in
this place add a very memorable instance
of the same <hi>Mezeray,</hi> which he relates ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pleasantly: That the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi>
who was then a Soveraign Prince, at his
return from his third or fourth Pilgrimage
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48703:23"/>
from <hi>Rome</hi> (for they were most esteemed,
who made most of those Journeys) found
his Country enriched with a new Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The <hi>Abbot</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn de Angeny,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found the Scull of a man in the wall,
the report was spread abroad, that it was
the head of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> The people of
<hi>France, Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> (who in
those days, which were after the year
One Thousand, run with great zeal after
all sorts of Reliques) came thither from
all parts: <hi>King Robert, the Queen,</hi> the
<hi>Duke of Normandy,</hi> and an infinite number
of <hi>Lords</hi> brought thither their Offerings.
That of the <hi>King</hi> was a <hi>shell of Gold,</hi> which
weighed <hi>thirty pounds,</hi> which was a very
admirable present in a time when Gold
and Silver were fifty times more rare than
it is in these days: And truly when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries</hi>
came to their wealth by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
as these, it is not to be wondered at,
that succeeding times thought they might
rob them of some part of it, without being
guilty of the sin of Sacriledge. In a word,
since so many learned <hi>Catholick Authors,</hi>
either take <hi>no notice</hi> of the miracles impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Saints by him who hath written
their Lives, or mention them very <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>
since <hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi> calls them <hi>old
Wives tales;</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Baronius,</hi> who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48703:23"/>
in the course of his History is obliged to
relate many of them, yet in such manner
as makes it manifest he gave no credit to
them: And since Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that no <hi>Catholick</hi> is bound to believe
them; I can see no reason why it should
be so hainous an offence in Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
to express no more reverence towards
them.</p>
            <p>Concerning the person of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> I
do not find that the Doctor in any place
calls him an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> or a <hi>counter feit En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast;</hi>
he may have been deluded by the
effects of a distempered faney, as many
well-meaning men have been; and in
truth I think Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is less tender of his
honour than he ought to be, by challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all men to discover any thing in, or of
S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> that may abate that reverence
to his memory, that he is bound to pay
him, and none disturb him in it, except
they be haled <hi>by him</hi> to rake into his ashes,
which whosoever shall do cannot but find
enough that will lessen the esteem men
would be willing to have of him. If Saint
<hi>Bennet</hi>'s rules contain nothing but a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
skilfully made of all <hi>Evangelical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi>
and <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>perfection:</hi> If there
the <hi>Ecclesiastical office</hi> is so wisely ordered,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48703:24"/>
that the whole Church judged it fit to be
her pattern, of which I never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
If S. <hi>Bennet</hi> teaches his Disciples to
begin all their actions with an eye to God,
begging his assistance, and referring them
intirely to God's glory. If there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in <hi>his Rules,</hi> but what is mentioned
by Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> (though there doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
all things necessary in it, for a great
and a wise King to make choice of for his
rule in managing his Kingdom, nor doth
he tell us who that wise King was) S. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
may have been, and Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> might
have continued a <hi>Protestant;</hi> all those
ends, if there be no other in S. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s
Rules, being as much commended and
enjoyned by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as
they are by any thing prescribed in the
other Injunctions; and if humility and
peaceful obedience are indeed so copiously
and vehemently inforced, as if in them
the spirit of his rule did principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
he must not take it ill if he be
thought not to have studied or conformed
himself to that Rule, when he presumes
to call a great King a Tyrant, a King that
was Soveraign over all his Ancestors, and
lived and died as much a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and as
much an enemy to all <hi>Protestants</hi> as
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> himself is at present; and how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48703:24"/>
he comes to have authority from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of his humility and peaceful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to stile such a Prince a Tyrant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not permit another Prince
to be a Tyrant in his Dominions, and over
his subjects, cannot be easily understood,
except it be to insinuate to all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
what he thinks of them; and what he
thinks he speaks, when they shall deny
obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which the most
<hi>Catholick Kings</hi> frequently have done upon
several occasions in the most <hi>Catholick
times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, if he well consider it,
he must believe that that single appellation
of Tyrant (setting aside the distance of
the Persons) is an expression more inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
more rude, and in all respects more
reproachful and scandalous than all the
terms put together in Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s
Book can amount unto, and to which he
takes so great exception. But I cannot
enough wonder after all this at the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s spirit, in which he is
willing even to appeal to the Doctors own
judgment, if he will but vouchsafe to read,
and examine the rules of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> which
it is not possible for him to do, without
reading the second Chapter, in which he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48703:25"/>
describes the duty of an <hi>Abbot,</hi> who, he
says, ought to be the more careful of his
behaviour, <hi>Christi enim agere vices in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterio
creditur, quando ipsius vocatur prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomine;</hi>
for he proves that our Saviour
was an <hi>Abbot</hi> upon Earth by that of S. <hi>Paul,
Accepistis spiritum adoptionis filiorum in quo
clamamus Abba Pater, We have not received
the spirit of bondage again to fear, but we
have received the spirit of adoption, whereby
we cry, Abba Father;</hi> by which Text
S. <hi>Bennet</hi> thought it was sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that <hi>Christ</hi> was an <hi>Abbot.</hi> Is the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Rule now like to advance the
honour of S. <hi>Benedict?</hi> Or is it possible for
any man who doth read it, to believe the
poor man (how good soever his meaning
might be) qualified to give rules which
can improve knowledge or devotion?
And in truth I think every man who reads
the Orders which were at first instituted
by S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and the other religious
men named, as every man may read them
who desires it, will find himself more in
danger to be stirred to another passion than
choler, which is too predominant in the
Doctor, if he be provoked to it upon such
an occasion, at least that he will not find
himself obliged to be of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>those Orders</hi> were instituted by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48703:25"/>
the <hi>inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and a
man may honestly believe that there are
not two men of that <hi>Society,</hi> to which
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> was a great honour, who do
concur with him in that opinion, further
than in what relates to S. <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part I have always had
more kindness and esteem for the <hi>Monks</hi>
of that <hi>Order,</hi> I mean for those of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Congregation,</hi> and have had more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with them, than with any other
<hi>Religious</hi> of our Nation. They are (very
few excepted) all <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and of very
<hi>good Families</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is) and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
civil and quiet natures, not petulant
and troublesome to those who do not think
as they do: and they were very kind to all
their banished <hi>Country-men</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Flanders;</hi> for I have not known them
in any other <hi>Provintes</hi> in the times of the
late persecution. I have been assured that
they expressed more affection and duty to
the King, and were more useful to him,
even in assisting him with money in his
greatest distresses, and performing other
offices for him, than all the other <hi>Religious
Communities</hi> put together: And they had
the good fortune to have opportunity to be
instrumental towards his Majestie's <hi>happy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48703:26"/>
deliverance,</hi> after the <hi>Battle</hi> at <hi>Worcester;</hi>
the consideration of all which hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with the King to give them more
countenance and protection than he hath
done to any other <hi>Ecclesiastical order;</hi> and
which on their part they have so well me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,
that I have not heard of one <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctine
Monk</hi> (Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> only excepted)
who hath imbarked himself in <hi>controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
in the present conjuncture, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting
of himself and others, and in
throwing reproaches upon the <hi>Church of
England;</hi> which may make men think
that they do not live all by the same rule,
at least that they do not interpret it by the
same spirit; and yet after all this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which is due to them from me, I can
by no means acknowledge or imagine why
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> avows it, <hi>That we owe to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
and Disciples of S.</hi> Benedict <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of almost all the Literature which
remains in the World,</hi> which he says <hi>pag.</hi> 26.<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note>
and which all the other Orders me-thinks,
which for the most part have been much
more industrious in that contribution,
should not take well.</p>
            <p>Besides, that as in the time of S. <hi>Bennet</hi>
(which may be reckoned to be about the
year Five Hundred and Fifty) Learning
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48703:26"/>
did in no degree flourish; so it grew less
and less for Seven Hundred years after his
time, or near so much, even to the Age in
which <hi>Erasmus</hi> lived, who knew the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> very well:
And truly I think Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s Superiors
may believe that he hath taken too much
pains in collecting a bundle of reproaches
of a false pretender to Visions, Miracles
and Inspirations, and an ignorant fool to
be cast upon their <hi>Founder,</hi> not one of
which is laid to his charge by the Doctor,
and must therefore be imputed to another
Author; and he hath less reason to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that those reproaches must fall upon
S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> because he confirmed the
Rules, and writ the life of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> both
which he might do without being guilty
of either of those imputations. He never
knew S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and confirmed his Rules
long after his death, which makes some
<hi>Catholick Writers</hi> believe that the Rules
were in truth not made by S. <hi>Benedict;</hi>
and a known <hi>Catholick Antiquary,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> takes upon him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself was never a
<hi>Monk</hi> of <hi>that Order,</hi> which is a greater
affront to it than any that the Doctor hath
put upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48703:27"/>
I do not know but that the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> hath a just reverence and esteem
of the learning, and of the piety of S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi>
and a greater than Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath,
(as will appear anon) however as the
most learned men, who write many
Books, seldom write all with the same
perfection and accurateness of judgment,
and their Readers do not look upon all
with the same estimation; so many do
not believe (and I doubt not many <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>)
that S. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s <hi>Dialogue</hi> of the
Life of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> is for the learning or
judgment of it, equal to the rest of his
Works: But Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is very hard to be
pleased, who hath been so very angry with
the Doctor for the rudeness and incivility
of his language, and is now no less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with him for his excess of civility
in calling S. <hi>Benedict Saint,</hi> which, he says
<hi>pag.</hi> 31.<note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> 
               <hi>If he was guilty of what the Doctor
charges him with, savours something of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</hi>
Truly though many men cannot
comprehend how S. <hi>Benedict</hi> attained that
degree, yet no body is sure that he hath it
not, and his title doth not seem the worse,
because he doth not appear qualified by
any particular <hi>Canonization</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> (there
being I think no Record of any such) but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48703:27"/>
by a general consent amongst many devout
persons, which is the title of all those <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Saints,</hi> to whose memories our
Church pays as much reverence as the
other doth, before those very <hi>costly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencements</hi>
were established at <hi>Rome,</hi>
which have lately conferred all those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and the preliminaries to it: But I
think it is now the civility of most of the
<hi>Provinces of Europe</hi> to treat all men with
the same stile that they assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or their Friends attribute to them,
and so we use to call those Saints who are
commonly called so, though we are not
sure they are in Heaven, and he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he were very unkindly dealt
with, if he should be charged with want
of integrity for calling the <hi>Reverend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
of our Church, <hi>Bishops,</hi> when if he did
believe them really to be so, he would not
when he left the Church have been re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
and if he does not believe them to
be such, his insincerity is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
than our blasphemy in calling those
Saints of whose station we are not so well
assured.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath a greater insight into
History, and a more discerning spirit than
any man of whom I have ever heard, if he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48703:28"/>
hath discovered, <hi>That the greatest Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Plague that God ever (no doubt in
his just anger) brought upon the Christian
world, or any Christian part of it, in that
general deluge of the</hi> Goths, Vandals, Huns,
Saxons, Danes, <hi>and other Pagan Nations,
proved a most unvaluable blessing</hi> (as he says
pag. 32.<note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note>) <hi>because God of those stones raised up
children unto</hi> Abraham, that is, after these
inhumane miscreants had for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years massacred many millions of
Christians, demolished so many Churches
and Religious houses, and introduced a
brutish savageness into the very nature of
the Inhabitants within the Provinces of
which they were possessed, some of their
posterity became <hi>Christians,</hi> and yet for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
an Age after their conversion, their
<hi>manners</hi> remained still almost as much <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
as they were before. And for their
building of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Schools of piety,</hi>
hear what <hi>Monsieur Mezeray</hi> (who is
much more conversant with the transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those times than Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is) says,
I <hi>know no time in which there were more
Churches and Abbies built than in this,</hi>
(speaking of the Tenth Century, which
was near the time when the most general
conversion of these Barbarians happened)
<hi>The most wicked persons affected</hi> (says he) <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48703:28"/>
much the title of Founders, whist they
ruined Churches on one side, they built others
on the contrary, and made sacrilegious Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to God of those things which they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
from the poor;</hi> and therefore those
structures are not always the best <hi>Records</hi>
of the piety of the Age in which they are
erected; and very few of the <hi>Monasteries</hi>
into which <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
used to retire for attending their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
meditation were erected after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion
of those <hi>barbarous Pagans,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which that numerous <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
was likewise expired, since that time
must be reckoned under the Ten Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
So that the unvaluable blessing that
Christian Religion received from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
inundation, is not yet discovered or
understood; and less, that the persons
who by Gods blessed directions instilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hearts of men such an <hi>heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Faith,</hi> and <hi>Divine love</hi> were principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Disciples</hi> of S. <hi>Benedict.</hi> I must tell
him again that <hi>Christianity</hi> was well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
before S. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Rules were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
or confirmed, which was not till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the year Six Hundred; and from that
time it received greater improvement from
the piety and learning of many <hi>devout Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>
and from the <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>good lives</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48703:29"/>
of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and of other <hi>Religious men,</hi>
than it hath ever done by the <hi>disciples</hi> of
S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> except all the <hi>Monasteries</hi> that
have been ever founded, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<hi>Monks</hi> shall be looked upon as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him; upon which computation I
doubt many of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s mistakes are to
be imputed; nor is he probably well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the numbers which have been
converted to <hi>Christianity</hi> by the <hi>Protestant
Churches,</hi> though he takes upon him to
know that there is not one <hi>Village</hi> which
he would hardly undertake, since he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but know that the <hi>Protestants</hi> have
many <hi>large Plantations</hi> in <hi>Provinces</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by <hi>Pagans,</hi> whereof many have been
converted; if he did not think that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
from <hi>Paganism</hi> is to little purpose,
if it be not to the <hi>Popes obedience,</hi> which is
not indeed a condition imposed upon the
<hi>Protestant proselytes:</hi> And if he will not
allow us the having ever done one miracle,
he is not of the mind of as great a <hi>Catholick
Doctor</hi> as himself, Dr. <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> who in
his <hi>Ecclesiastical History</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> after
he hath at large described the miracle
wrought by <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> in the
cure of those noisom swellings (which
hath since got the name of the <hi>Kings
Evil:)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 219.</note> He adds, <hi>Quam strumosos sanandi
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48703:29"/>
admirabilem dotem in posteros suos Anglorum
Reges, ad nostra usque tempora transfudisse
&amp; perpetuâsse meritò creditur:</hi> And
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> may be informed that no <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
King</hi> hath more notoriously cured
multitudes of people of both Sexes, than
the <hi>present King</hi> hath done, both whilst
he remained in the parts <hi>beyond the Seas,</hi>
and since his return into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath chafed himself
into a very tragical heighth of choler,
when after his passionate and ungrave
commination of what the Doctor shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
at the day of Judgment, he defies
him to say, <hi>pag.</hi> 35.<note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> publickly, or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to signifie only his opinion, <hi>That
S.</hi> Benedict, <hi>S.</hi> Gregory, <hi>S.</hi> Francis, <hi>and
the rest are now reprobate damned Souls in
Hell, yet such</hi> (he says) <hi>they must be if they
were hypocritical Visionaries, and false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
of Miracles,</hi> &amp;c. and if such be not his
opinion, nay, if he be not assured that
they are in a cursed condition, he asks,
<hi>Whether his Tongue or Pen was not set on fire
of Hell, whilst he uttered such blasphemies
against them, as a perpetual monument of his
rage till the day of Iudgment,</hi> I cannot
imagine what storm hath raised this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
of words; where is this rage? where
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48703:30"/>
was this blasphemy? Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will have
too great an advantage against those who
differ from him in opinion, if they must
be obliged to condemn all those whose
words which they are said to have spoken,
they do not believe, nor those actions
which are imputed to them to be damned
in Hell: Such fury may possess Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi>
and some others (I hope not many) of <hi>his
Religion,</hi> but <hi>our Church</hi> allows no such
presumption in <hi>her Children.</hi> Many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick
and fanciful men have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that they have had <hi>visions</hi> and <hi>illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
which have been but the effects of
their <hi>fancy</hi> and melancholy: Others have
believed men to have wrought miracles,
which they never did work; and some
things to have been miracles which were
not miracles, and no sober men will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
either of those to damnation: Nay,
if any pious persons out of their zeal to
Christianity have believed it necessary to
the promotion thereof, to devise miracles,
and perswade others to believe them (as
many such frauds have been imputed to
the <hi>ancient Monks</hi> by <hi>Catholick writers</hi>)
God forbid that we should believe that
those Souls are therefore in Hell. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
hath a credulity towards miracles greater
than most Catholicks, it may be than any
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48703:30"/>
one other learned Catholick; and yet it is
possible that he may not believe that <hi>vision</hi>
or <hi>illumination</hi> which S. <hi>Francis</hi> relates of
himself; that when he had made his <hi>first
Rule,</hi> many thought it too hard, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that he would lessen the rigour of it;
whereupon he went up into a mountain
called <hi>Palombo,</hi> and after many prayers and
tears to God, and long fasting upon Bread
and Water, <hi>Spiritu sancto suggerente, &amp;
Christo dictante,</hi> he writ those Rules which
still are pretended to be observed, and
which upon this ground were confirmed
by <hi>Pope Honorius the third;</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all which, his own <hi>Friers of Assissium</hi>
remained still unsatisfied with the severity
and rigour of those his <hi>second Rules,</hi> and
obliged their <hi>Superiour</hi> to accompany them
to <hi>S. Francis,</hi> who seeing them coming,
called to them, and asked them what they
came for; to which they resolutely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that his <hi>new rule</hi> was too sharp,
and that they would not be bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it; he should make it for himself,
but not for them: upon which S. <hi>Francis</hi>
turned his face to Heaven, and said to our
Saviour, <hi>Lord, did not I tell thee that these
men would not believe me? Tune audierunt
omnes vocem Christi respondentem in aere,
Francisce, Nihil est in regula de tuo, sed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48703:31"/>
meum est quicquid est ibi; &amp; volo quod re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula
sic observetur, ad literam, ad literam,
ad literam, sine glossa, sine glossa, sine glossa;</hi>
and added, <hi>Ego scio quantum potest humana
fragilitas, &amp; quantum volo juvare eos, qui
hanc regulam amplectentur, qui ergo nolunt
observare eam, exeant de ordine;</hi> upon
which he pacified his Friers, and thought
<hi>his Rules</hi> to be as much dictated to him by
our Saviour, as the <hi>Law</hi> was by God to
<hi>Moses</hi> upon the <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> all this is
printed with <hi>his Rule,</hi> and with the <hi>Popes
Bulls,</hi> and the <hi>testimony of S. Bonaventure.</hi>
If Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> doth believe this, he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
more than any learned <hi>Capuchin</hi> or
<hi>Franciscan Frier</hi> doth pretend to believe,
and if he doth not believe it, he rejects
S. <hi>Francis</hi> his own evidence, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than hath been given for any one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
that is imputed to him: Certainly
whatsoever a man is not bound to believe
he may very lawfully disbelieve; so that
I know not where the Doctor's fault is by
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s own judgment; for he says,
no man is obliged to believe them: After
all which I cannot enough admire and pity
the strange extasie into which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s
passion hath transported him, that he
should reprove the Doctor for not giving
the same credit to the <hi>Visions,</hi> and <hi>Dreams,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48703:31"/>
and <hi>Revelations</hi> of S. <hi>Benedict &amp;</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi>
as he is bound to do, to the prescription of
diet which God himself gave to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Ezekiel,</hi> and the command he gave to
the <hi>Prophet Isaiah</hi> to go naked and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,
or to the injunction our Saviour laid
upon his Disciples in an extraordinary
mission not to salute any man they met;
that is, because he believes the <hi>word of God,</hi>
which every Christian professes to do, he
should likewise believe those <hi>visions</hi> and
<hi>miracles,</hi> which few wise men think to be
true, and they who do, confess that they
are not bound to think so; and therefore
it is the office of a Friend to desire Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
once more to revolve the <hi>three last pages of</hi>
his <hi>second Chapter,</hi> and seriously consider,
whether there be not more wrath, and
clamour, and evil speaking, and even
prophaneness, if not blasphemy, than all
put together in the <hi>Doctors Book</hi> can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
amount to in any candid interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I doubt he will have as ill luck in his
<hi>third Chapter,</hi> and the worse because the
subject of it, <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Contemplation,</hi>
hath not at all mollified his spirit, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his passion to any sobriety. Must a
man be thought to be averse to a <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48703:32"/>
life,</hi> or to be an enemy to, or a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the <hi>Prayer of contemplation,</hi> because
he is not much affected with the Rules and
prescriptions which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and some
other of his Friends have taken upon them
to give, for rendring the same more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and exact? And though the Doctor is
more modest than to make his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and understanding an argument to
condemn what another man thinks very
reasonable (which is the syllogism the
other out of kindness hath made for him;)
yet truly I have so good an opinion of
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s understanding, that if he
should tell me, that he had held a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
upon matter of Religion with a man
who entertained him for half an hour in
a continued speech, with many proper,
and in themselves very intelligible words,
which drew his best attention to what he
said, which was all pronounced in so
grave a tone, that he suspected his own
understanding for not quickly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
what his meaning could be; but
that after all his intentness of mind, he
could observe nothing but a heap of words
improperly mingled together, without
any coherence or context to make any sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification:
I should presently conclude,
that what he had heard was <hi>unintelligible
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48703:32"/>
canting;</hi> for what other definition can be
given of <hi>unintelligible canting,</hi> than a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of affected words, which have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,
and of which men of very compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
parts, and who hear patiently, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
collect any sence? And I have always
believed that men who cannot express
their own meaning, in words and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
that men of good comprehension do
understand their meaning, have not clear
notions themselves of what they do deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and if <hi>mystick Divines</hi> will express
their conceptions of the most pure opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Soul her self, and likewise of
God upon the Soul, in such terms and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as none but those of their own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
can upon hearing them know what
they would have, they must not take it
ill if other men believe that they have a
<hi>peculiar cipher</hi> between themselves, which
being in words, is only <hi>sence to them,</hi> and
<hi>canting to every body else:</hi> But without
doubt Prayer, and whatsoever relates to
it, should always consist of language so
plain and easie, that the meanest and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of the people cannot but know what
every word signifies. And as he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
very unhappy in his application of
Scripture; so he now prophanes S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
name to a purpose so contrary to what he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48703:33"/>
would apply it to, that if there were no
other argument to convince him of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
that Text alone would do it very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
S. <hi>Paul, who,</hi> he says, <hi>was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Master of Language that perhaps ever
was, yet for want of words could not describe
the extasie he had been in, nor the vision that
he had seen, but professed that no humane
language could describe them, nor humane
fancy comprehend them,</hi> and therefore
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> says, that according to the
<hi>Doctors</hi> grounds, S. <hi>Paul</hi> should be the
greatest <hi>Fanatick</hi> that ever was, yea the
Father of all <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> yet the Doctor
dares not call him so, whereas the Doctor
only calls those <hi>Fanaticks</hi> who will not
imitate S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but upon an imagination
that they have seen somewhat which few
men believe they did see, will needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it in words which no body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands:
and though that great <hi>Master of
Language,</hi> therefore forbore to mention
what he had seen or heard, because there
were no words which would serve the
turn, he hath helped S. <hi>Paul</hi> to proper
words to do it by; and says that it cannot
be denied to have been a <hi>passive union</hi> of
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Soul with God, but since S. <hi>Paul</hi>
could not tell what it was, we are not
bound to believe that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> knows
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48703:33"/>
better, or can better express it; and it
were to be wished that his Friends, if they
have such apparitions as they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
they will be as modest as S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and not go about to describe them, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they do understand themselves,
what they cannot make any body else to
understand.</p>
            <p>Since Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> appeals from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
to the <hi>indifferent Reader,</hi> upon his
sharp censure of some expressions in <hi>Sancta
Sophia,</hi> and takes much pains to make
<hi>elucidations</hi> upon those difficult places
which the Doctor thought hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and which he seems to believe
will, by the pains he hath taken, appear
very intelligible. I cannot but take my
self to be one of those <hi>indifferent Readers,</hi>
who is not by any prejudice to the man, or
to the matter uncapable of judging of the
sence of what he reads: And I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that by Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s favour and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I had one of those Books of <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi>
presented to me assoon as it was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
which I was the more impatient to
read, because he had recommended it to
me as a Book worthy to be read by all
Christians, since it medled not with any
Controversies, but was the greatest help
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48703:34"/>
to devotion in general, that had been yet
published; nor did he think himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the commendation, since he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
professed that he was not Author of
any thing contained in the Book, but of
the method and marshalling the several
discourses out of Papers and Notes, not
enough digested by the death of Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
who was generally esteemed a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and devout man; and truly I believe he
might be so, and as I have heard (for I
never saw him, nor did Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> I think)
spent more time privately upon his own
thoughts, than in books or conversation.
I cannot deny but that I did then think
that what was not very vulgarly said,
which was honest, was very obscure and
difficult to be understood, which I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
impute to want of capacity in my self,
until I read many of the particulars to
others much wiser, and in all respects very
competent judges of such discourses; and
when upon a full disquisition I found them
of the same opinion, and that they knew
not how to make any thing that was said
applicable to heighten their own devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I begun to conclude too, that what
benefit soever others might attain by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it (for I met with some women who
professed to have received much benefit by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48703:34"/>
it) I should get little in taking more pains
to comprehend it; and I remember it
came out much about the same time that
Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> published a book of the
same subject, <hi>of the love of God, and the
union with God;</hi> which when I had read,
and found nothing of his usual clearness
and ratiocination in his discourse, in which
he used much to excel the best of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
he kept, and that the stile thereof
was very like that of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> and
that in a crowd of very easie words the
sence was too hard to find out: I was of
opinion that the subject matter of it was of
so delicate a nature, that it required ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of preparation of mind, and it
may be another kind of diet than men are
ordinarily supplied with: And I am now
the more confirmed in that judgment, by
finding all Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s <hi>glosses</hi> which he
hath taken the pains to make, to inform
his indifferent Reader of the sence of those
hard places, do but make the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof the more intricate, and that
the <hi>Commentary</hi> is not less obscure than the
<hi>Text,</hi> and nothing is more wonderful than
that the illustration he makes to facilitate
the understanding of what is conceived
obscure, by the Prayer in our Churches
Liturgy, (which he says was borrowed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48703:35"/>
from the <hi>Roman,</hi> and I say was translated
out of our own,) <hi>Lord, from whom all
good things come, grant us thy humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that by thy holy inspiration we may
think those things that be good, and by thy
merciful guiding we may perform the same:</hi>
I say it is strange that he does not so far dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
that this Prayer is so easie that no
one pretends not to understand the perfect
meaning and extent thereof; whereas he
cannot but know that some men of more
than common understanding profess not
to comprehend the other; and therefore
it is too magisterial a determination, that
whosoever hath not a capacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> is an enemy to mental
Prayer, which no body can be who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
it, or in the least degree hath
endeavoured to practise it: Since it is the
best, if not the only way to keep the mind
fixed upon the subject it is solicitous for,
and the object to whom the Prayers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
which in the loud pronunciation
of many words, is, it may be, to many
men the most difficult thing in the sacrifice
of Prayer, especially if there be any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of words, which insensibly carries
the mind away from what it should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon, and the least moment of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
puts a period to mental prayer, which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48703:35"/>
without any sensible motion hath a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
that cannot bear interruption, and
as little any prescription of method from
another man.</p>
            <p>To the personal reflexions and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
against the Doctor, fuller of cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
passions, and of bitterness, and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
than I have ever observed in so little
room in any book, I shall answer in a more
proper place anon.</p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath spent many pages
in commending to his friends the having
a good opinion of <hi>Visions,</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi>
and <hi>Miracles,</hi> and very pathetically ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
them to read the Histories of the <hi>lives
of Saints,</hi> which the more they have done,
they may probably be the less inclined to
conform to his opinions; he professes that
the only ground of the <hi>Catholicks faith,</hi> is
<hi>divine Revelation</hi> made to the Church by
<hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and conveyed to
posterity in <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition;</hi> and
we say that the ground of the Faith of the
<hi>Church of England</hi> is the same, leaving out
the two last words, <hi>and tradition;</hi> not that
the <hi>Church of England</hi> is an enemy to, or
disclaims the use of <hi>tradition,</hi> but is not
guided and governed by it, by reason of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48703:36"/>
the incertainty of it: Where the <hi>tradition</hi>
is <hi>universal</hi> and <hi>uncontradicted,</hi> we have as
much <hi>resignation</hi> to it as they have; and
therefore we do acknowledge the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Scripture to be by unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and never doubted tradition: and
that having thereby received it, it hath in
it self enough to convince the Reader that
it could not be formed and invented by the
wit of man, nor that it hath not been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
or corrupted by the malice of man;
and so we are possessed of the Scriptures by
the same tradition that they are; and
whatever they believe by as confessed a
tradition, we believe likewise as well as
they: But when they urge many things
as necessary to be believed by the <hi>authority
of tradition,</hi> we do not reject the <hi>authority,</hi>
but deny the <hi>tradition,</hi> and say there is no
tradition that will warrant it; and how
fallible that pretence is, needs no other
manifestation than that controversie of the
<hi>observation of Easter,</hi> which continued
half a hundred years only upon the point
of <hi>tradition</hi> with so much bitterness and
animosity; the <hi>Greek Church</hi> alledging
that tradition was for them, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church</hi> the contrary; and if tradition
was so doubtful a guide in those Primitive
times, when so few years had run out,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48703:36"/>
what must it be now, when five times as
many are since expired. They therefore
do not deal ingenously, who amuse <hi>their
auditors</hi> with telling them, that we reject
<hi>all tradition,</hi> consider not <hi>antiquity,</hi> submit
to no <hi>authority,</hi> but every man chuses a
<hi>Religion</hi> according to his <hi>own spirit:</hi>
Whereas they well know that the <hi>Church
of England</hi> doth as much respect <hi>tradition</hi>
when it is agreed upon (as all evidence
must be that is submitted to) and requires
as much subjection to <hi>authority,</hi> and leaves
as little to the <hi>private fancy</hi> and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, and pays as much reverence
to the <hi>primitive Fathers</hi> where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
together in opinion, as the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> doth; but denies any subjection to
<hi>that Church,</hi> and believes that <hi>her own
children</hi> (with others she meddles not)
should have the same reverence for <hi>her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,</hi>
as those others have for <hi>the
Roman;</hi> since her determinations are
made with as much <hi>regularity,</hi> as <hi>lawful
authority,</hi> and with the <hi>unanimous advice</hi>
of as learned men, as by the others, of
which we shall say more in the conclusion
of this discourse.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> was not very confident that
all for whom he writes, will confidently
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48703:37"/>
believe all he says, and had not a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
contempt of all other persons, he
would not so positively say, <hi>That when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
is made of miracles in order to the
Canonization of any Saint, the testimony of
women will not be received,</hi> pag. 68.<note place="margin">Pag. 68.</note> and
gives the reason for it, <hi>because naturally
imagination is stronger in them than judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and whatsoever is esteemed by them to
be pious, is easily concluded by them to be true;</hi>
which may likewise be the reason that his
beloved <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> is so much valued
by <hi>women,</hi> and <hi>his Miracles</hi> so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by them only, and neither the one
or the other in any degree regarded by any
learned men of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> But his
averment that the testimony of women is
rejected in those cases, is without any
ground. Was not the single testimony of
the <hi>Nurse</hi> the only evidence of the first mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
that was wrought by his adored
S. <hi>Benedict</hi> in the mending the <hi>Sieve,</hi> or
putting together the broken pieces of the
<hi>Earthen pot?</hi> If he were much conversant
in the acts of <hi>Canonization,</hi> as he ought to
be before he publishes the Rules observed
there, he would have found that the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
miracle</hi> wrought by <hi>Philip Nereus</hi>
(the Founder of the <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>Oratori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)</hi>
for which he was <hi>Canonized,</hi> was,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48703:37"/>
that he cured diseases oftentimes by <hi>his
word;</hi> as particularly in the case of <hi>Maria
Felici à Castro; in Monasterio Turris specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
Moniali, quae continua febri correpta,
Philippo jubente statim convaluit:</hi> And <hi>his
eighth</hi> was, that he cured many sick people
meerly by <hi>his apparition; Ac Drusilla Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
quae praecipiti casuprostrata, ac horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili
capitis, oculorum &amp; totius corporis collisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,
semiviva jacens, tribus Philippi appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritionibus
mirabiliter liberatur:</hi> And he
would likewise have found in the <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation</hi>
of <hi>Ignotius Loyala</hi> his <hi>thirty third mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi>
is, that of <hi>Isabella Monialis ord. S. Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi>
who being threescore and seven years
old, being in a very high place about bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
by mischance had a terrible fall to
the ground, with which she broke her
thigh, and for above forty days <hi>adhibitis
per Medicum &amp; Chirurgum, eventu planè
irrito, medicamentis,</hi> and all hope of life
being in the judgment of all, hopeless and
desperate, <hi>petita tamen pia cum religione &amp;
impetrata reliquia B. Ignatii &amp; super coxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicem
applicata, statim sana est reddita, &amp;
coxendicem &amp; tibiam prius tumentem, atque
immobilem, expedite, &amp; sine dolore movere
coepit, &amp; die proxima surrexit, ac libere &amp;
perfecte ambulavit.</hi> Many more of the
like instances he will find in the <hi>fourth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48703:38"/>
Tome</hi> of the great <hi>Bullarium;</hi> and without
the evidence of these <hi>three women,</hi> these
<hi>miracles</hi> had been lost, which could not
but contribute very much to their <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation:</hi>
Nor was the <hi>Testimony of women</hi>
ever rejected in those cases, it is probable
for that very reason for which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
seems to think their evidence ought not to
be received, <hi>because imagination is stronger
in them than judgment, and that whatsoever
is esteemed by them to be pious, is easily by
them concluded to be true;</hi> and such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will easily perswade
them to believe that many things are pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
which he knows not to be true: And
in truth he hath not answered the weight
of the Doctors instance of the visions of
S. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and S. <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Syena,</hi>
with all the help that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Baronius</hi> can give him; the last of
which apparently believed neither of
them; and his <hi>own addition</hi> is much less sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
to any discerning person, <hi>that no
Oecumenical Council hath made a Canon with
an Anathema against all those who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
all the Revelations of S.</hi> Bridget
<hi>to have been divine, and the belief of them
necessary to salvation, and that all that was
done by the Council, was upon occasion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
made against those Revelations by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48703:38"/>
many Catholicks to require</hi> Joannes à Turre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremata,
<hi>to peruse and give his judgment of
them;</hi> which being favourable, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
approved them, says the Doctor, that
is (says Mr. <hi>Cressy) freely permitted them
to be read, as containing nothing contrary to
faith and good manners.</hi> The <hi>Councils</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
was much more than that; but
if it were no more, it doth not become the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or any <hi>National Church</hi>
to give that countenance to any new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that may encourage such a liberty, as
he says is taken by many writers to decry
both the one and the other, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
animosity, and uncharitableness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christians, which hath been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
enough in this particular: And since
he confesses that many illusions and fancies
have been brought into the Church by
pretence of such <hi>Revelations</hi> by the several
<hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> named by the Doctor;
as the <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Mendicants,</hi> the <hi>Authors</hi> of
the <hi>Evangelium aeternum,</hi> and the rest; all
or most of which did find countenance,
and exceedingly disturb the peace of the
Church, and who Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> confesses
were <hi>Monsters</hi> raised up by <hi>the Devil</hi> in a
cursed imitation of the <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi>
communicated by God to his devout and
faithful servants: There cannot be too
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48703:39"/>
much vigilance in shutting all doors at
which such illusions may enter, and no
body is to be blamed, who is most jealous
of their integrity.</p>
            <p>We come in the next place to his fifth
Chapter of <hi>resisting authority,</hi> falsly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he says, to <hi>Catholick Religion, in
which,</hi> he says, <hi>the Doctor doth very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
absolve the Catholick Church her self, and
lays the fault only on the principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of the Iesuitical party.</hi> Indeed the
Doctor cannot but absolve the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> from that reproach, except he
thought all <hi>Christian Churches</hi> liable to it;
but he is far from absolving all <hi>Catholicks</hi> of
the <hi>Roman Church</hi> from <hi>rebellion,</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only the <hi>Iesuits</hi> (though he instances
most in them, because the books which
most defend it have been written by those
of that Society) but nothing can be stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> should so magnifie
the general obedience of all <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi>
that none of them were ever in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
against the <hi>King,</hi> or his <hi>Father,</hi>
when he knows very well, and hath some
marks of it, that the whole <hi>Irish Nation</hi>
(very few persons of honour excepted)
joyned in <hi>rebellion</hi> against the <hi>King;</hi> and
but for <hi>that rebellion</hi> neither <hi>Presbyterian,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48703:39"/>
Independant</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist</hi> had been able to
have done any harm in <hi>England.</hi> For the
<hi>Scots rebellion</hi> was totally suppressed, and
their <hi>Army</hi> disbanded before the <hi>Irish rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>
begun: It was that which produced
all the mischief that succeeded in <hi>England,</hi>
and gave those <hi>Sects</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to bring in their confusion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> with
such barbarous circumstances as are too
horrible to <hi>repeat,</hi> though they can never
be <hi>forgotten:</hi> Was not that Rebellion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
and carried on intirely by the <hi>Kings
Roman Catholick subjects?</hi> Was there one
man but <hi>Catholicks</hi> who concurred in it?
and did they pretend any other cause for it
but <hi>Religion?</hi> at least when they had the
satisfaction they desired, in whatsoever else
they pretended, did they not continue it
still under <hi>pretence of Religion?</hi> Was not the
<hi>secular</hi> and <hi>regular Clergy</hi> equally engaged
to support it? And did not the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
contribute to it, if not contrive it?
And was not himself in the person of his
<hi>Nuntio Rinnuccini, General</hi> of the <hi>Rebels,</hi>
both by Sea and Land? And can there be
a greater manifestation that the <hi>Catholick
Roman Religion</hi> it self favoured <hi>rebellion,</hi>
than when their <hi>head</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> and
all <hi>Ecclesiastical Orders</hi> joyned, and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48703:40"/>
in it? And it it cannot but be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that though the <hi>Irish</hi> for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
only carried on, or were active in
that <hi>Rebellion,</hi> there was not any <hi>English
Catholick</hi> that made any publick profession
against it, nor did one <hi>English Priest, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
or <hi>Regular,</hi> manifest his detestation or
dislike of it by any publick writing: And
how much they favoured it in private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
there wants not abundant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
All which should be <hi>forgotten,</hi> as
it is <hi>forgiven,</hi> before there be such <hi>loud En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums</hi>
published of the never-failing <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
of the <hi>Romish Catholicks,</hi> and the
<hi>Records</hi> of later <hi>rebellions in France,</hi> as well
as those of the <hi>League</hi> should be razed out.
It is to be wished rather than hoped that
the <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in any
Church had that impulsion in it as it ought
to have, that it preserved the professors of
it from entring into <hi>rebellion,</hi> and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of any other iniquity: Yet it may be
truly said, that there were very few who
did so much as pretend to have a reverence
for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that were ever
active in the <hi>late rebellion:</hi> How far the
fear and consternation men were in, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to submit to that torrent which
over-bore them, ought not to be imputed,
since it over whelmed multitudes of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48703:40"/>
who heartily abhorred those that
they were compelled to obey.</p>
            <p>It is a great instance of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s good
temper, if it be of his <hi>sincerity,</hi> that he is so
solicitous to purge the <hi>Iesuits</hi> from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
which are more particularly cast
on them: I believe they did not expect it
from him, who is not thought to agree
with them in all which they account <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental:</hi>
Yet truly the excuse he makes
for them, is such, as if he invited men to
keep up their prejudice against them:
<hi>That for asmuch as concerns the unsafe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchical
doctrine contained in those books
cited by the Doctor, it is almost a whole Age,
since that they have been by their General for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
under pain of Excommunication, and
other most grievous censures to justifie them,
either in writing, preaching, or disputing,</hi>
&amp;c. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> speaks much of <hi>retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and says well, <hi>That they who by writing
or otherwise have published scandalous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which hath corrupted other men, do
not do their duty in being silent, and giving
over to do that which will be no longer
safe for them to do, but that recantation and
retractation is necessary, that they may be
known to be no longer of the samc mind.</hi> Is
there any man of the <hi>society</hi> that hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48703:41"/>
against that <hi>Anti-monarchical</hi> doctrine,
who hath endeavoured to confute <hi>Cardinal
Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Mariana,</hi> or <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi>
or any of the rest? Is not <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s book
of the power of the <hi>Pope</hi> over <hi>Kings?</hi> are
not all the other books to be bought at
every Stationers shop? Who knows any
thing of the <hi>Generals</hi> warrants but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
It was known to, and permitted
by the <hi>Pope;</hi> that is, the <hi>Pope</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
when their books were out, that they
should be quiet, and write no more,
which would excuse them for not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those books, which <hi>Catholicks</hi> as well
as <hi>Protestants</hi> should write against them;
and that they might not enter into dispute
with the <hi>Colledge of Sorbon,</hi> which detested
their Principles: He says, <hi>It is well known
that in this point, Princes and States are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
become more clear-sighted, and more
wise than formerly they have been, and by
consequence the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>also.</hi> It is
indeed well known that the <hi>Court of Rome</hi>
adheres still to its <hi>own principles,</hi> though
they do not think fit to put Princes in mind
what they are; well knowing that all
their <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Interdictions</hi> and <hi>Absolutions,</hi>
how long soever since published, are still
in the same force and vigour, as they were
the first hour of their publication; and it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48703:41"/>
is very few years since, that upon an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of some consultation between the <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
and <hi>regular Clergy</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to present
an address to the <hi>King,</hi> in testimony of
their obedience, in which they disclaimed
any <hi>temporal authority</hi> to be in the <hi>Pope;</hi>
the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> was so alarm'd by it,
that Cardinal <hi>Barberine</hi> writ to them to
desist from any such <hi>Declaration,</hi> and put
them in mind that the <hi>Kingdom of England</hi>
was still under <hi>Excommunication;</hi> and
since that time, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath made <hi>many
Bishops</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which his <hi>predecessors</hi>
had forborn to do from the death of <hi>Queen
Elizabeth,</hi> to the year One thousand Six
hundred and Forty; and this is the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightedness
and wisdom that the <hi>Court of
Rome</hi> is lately improved in.</p>
            <p>But he doth assure you, that <hi>if an oath
were framed free from ambiguity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
odious phrases inserted in it (wholly unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the substance of it) the Iesuits would
not make any scruple of joyning with their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
brethren in it:</hi> Alas! what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
hath he to assure us this? He knows
very well that the <hi>Society</hi> will not trust
him to frame such <hi>Oath;</hi> and that they
and he differ very much in their <hi>judgments</hi>
in that point; and of all men, Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48703:42"/>
is the most unfit for such an undertaking:
He cannot forget that shortly after he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his <hi>Exomologesis</hi> (which in comparison
of all that he hath writ since may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as a <hi>modest Book,)</hi> he did in that
Book publish a protestation or subscription,
which all the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
would be willing to take; and in truth it
did not differ much in substance or sence
from the Oaths which are enjoyned by the
Law; and no doubt he would have taken
it himself, and did then believe that all
other <hi>Catholicks</hi> might have taken it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
But within a short time all that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of that Book was bought up, or
otherwise procured; and a <hi>second Edition</hi>
of it published, wherein there were very
many <hi>substantial alterations</hi> and <hi>additions</hi>
from what was in the former; the <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of duty</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> which was in
the <hi>first,</hi> was totally left out in the <hi>second
impression,</hi> it being not thought a fit obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
for the Catholicks to enter into:
The discourse he had made of <hi>Purgatory</hi>
was likewise left out, for he had mistaken
the tenent of his <hi>new Church</hi> in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
Many other alterations were made,
as must be confessed by any man, who will
take the pains to examine <hi>both Editions:</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48703:42"/>
There were also many <hi>additions,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>reproaches</hi> against the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and many <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>virulent expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
against the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>that Church:</hi> And
I know a person who meeting with
Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> expostulated with him upon
all those particulars; and asked him how
it came to pass that those were left out,
when his Book had been first licensed by
Dr. <hi>Holden,</hi> and <hi>another Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
and why the other calumnies were
added which so much reflected upon the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> contrary to what in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
he knew was true, to all which he
answered with <hi>passionate protestations,</hi> that
he never knew of one or the other till he
saw the <hi>second impression;</hi> that his <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi>
were offended with the <hi>first,</hi> in which
there were some mistakes, and that he
had intirely left it to their discretions to do
what they should think fit upon it;
whereupon they had caused it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
as it now stood, without at all
communicating with him; which it
seems being a custom amongst them, gives
me yet some hope that the very <hi>unusual
passion</hi> and <hi>incivility</hi> that runs through <hi>this
discourse</hi> may be added by the <hi>appointment</hi>
and <hi>direction</hi> of some <hi>Superiour:</hi> Since he
is not so much altered in his <hi>face</hi> or <hi>habit</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48703:43"/>
from what he was, when he was thirty
years of Age, as he is from that <hi>modesty</hi>
and <hi>gentleness</hi> of nature, and <hi>smoothness</hi> and
<hi>civility</hi> of stile, if all the expressions in his
Book are his own, from the time I knew
him, and had conversation with him:
But he finds it much easier to revile than
answer any Books the Doctor hath writ in
any time: Nor can his opinion be doubted
of the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
both which he hath often taken, and as
often declared his detestation of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will never be able
to prove he ever took: And if he had, it
could not be wondered at, since by the
age he was of when he published his Book
in defence of <hi>Archbishop Laud,</hi> (which
some who knew it well, assured me to be
but twenty eight years:) I cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to be, when the <hi>Covenant</hi> was
first appointed to be administred to all
<hi>Scholars</hi> in the <hi>Universities,</hi> above the age
of thirteen years, if so much; and cannot
be conceived to be at all instructed in the
principles of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which
had been long before that discountenanced
and suppressed: And no body doubts but
that there are very many reverend and
learned persons, who have now great and
unquestionable affection and zeal for <hi>that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48703:43"/>
Church,</hi> who did in their minority, and
under that accursed and tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
take that <hi>lewd Covenant,</hi> and
whose affection and zeal is not the less for
having taken it: But of all men it least
becomes Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> to put them in mind of
the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
when himself broke from the obligations
of them, and his own subscription, though
he was near, if not full forty years of age
when he last repeated those obligations;
and himself acknowledges that the Doctor
had the courage, even in those ill times, to
write against all the Religions which were
then professed, and countenanced, in his
<hi>Ironicon</hi> that he is so angry with: And I
do profess that I am not of the Doctor's
mind in all things which he says in that
Book; yet as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to confute it, so I am not sorry that no
body else hath gone about to answer it.</p>
            <p>I will not accompany Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> in his
uncharitable passion, which every expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
how lawful soever, that he dislikes,
kindles in him, by treating others as he
doth <hi>Archbishop Cranmer,</hi> whose memory
will be preserved, as of a most <hi>worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
and <hi>glorious Martyr,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foul imputations he is pleased to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48703:44"/>
cast upon him: Yet I must tell him, that
if that <hi>unhappy</hi> and <hi>ill advised Queen</hi> (who
had just reason to be offended highly with
that <hi>Archbishop)</hi> could have found that the
Law would have condemned him for
Treason, she rather desired to have had him
<hi>hanged</hi> for a <hi>Traitor,</hi> than to have him <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
for his <hi>Religion,</hi> since she wanted not
other instances enough of her severity in
that kind: But the Law would not extend
to serve her turn that way; if it would,
no body would have blamed her for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
prosecuted him with the utmost ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
whereas many good men then did,
and since have for proceeding the other
way with him. It is not new to find those
who have been adjudged <hi>Traitors</hi> by the
Law of the Land, looked upon in his
Church as <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which he well
knows is the case of some who were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the <hi>Gunpowder Treason:</hi> But he will
answer, that is no act of the <hi>Church,</hi> which
hath never declared them <hi>Martyrs;</hi> it may
be so, and it is as true, that the Church
hath in some times <hi>Canonized</hi> those who
were <hi>by Law</hi> known to be guilty of <hi>High
Treason</hi> (though not executed for it)
as <hi>Saints;</hi> for whoever understands the
Law as it was in those days, cannot doubt
but that <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was guilty of <hi>High
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48703:44"/>
Treason,</hi> and might legally have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against for it, as he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
afterwards for it; though the assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of him was in no degree warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
or to be excused: Many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the same kind may be given;
however it is a very sorry exception that
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> takes to <hi>Archbishop Cranmer</hi>'s
subscription of his opinion, that he remits
the judgment thereof wholly to the <hi>King:
So,</hi> says he, <hi>a final judgment both touching
Government and Doctrine is by the prime
Bishop referred to a King of about nine years
old, a great glory surely to the English:</hi>
Which is a suggestion below the wisdom
and experience of Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> who cannot
but know that in all <hi>Kingdoms hereditary,</hi>
that <hi>the King</hi> is not <hi>less King</hi> for being but
nine years of age, and that all sentences
and judgments are as much referred to him
then as when he is at full age; and the
transactions are concluded in the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and formality as they would be then:
As that opinion of the Archbishop was
considered by the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was done afterwards, which was
not in all particulars agreeable to that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
was concluded by the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
Nor is he much graver in his Comical
discourse of the <hi>Kings Title</hi> of being <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48703:45"/>
Governour of the Church of England,</hi>
(for he knows that <hi>head</hi> is not in the <hi>title,</hi>
though if it were, it would be of no other
signification) that the King may thereby
<hi>ordain Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> himself, which
he well knows the <hi>Crown</hi> always dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims,
and the <hi>Church</hi> never admitted,
but knows very well that the King hath
as much authority to appoint and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
those who shall do both within his
own dominions, as the <hi>Pope</hi> (who doth
neither with his own hands) hath in his
own Territories, or others, where, by
the consent of the Princes, he hath that
jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>I shall say nothing in defence of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> of whose communion I do
not profess my self to be; they are of age,
let them speak for themselves; yet I may
say that I do not comprehend how <hi>their
Confession of faith obliges them to be Traitors
and Rebels whensoever the honour of God
(which,</hi> he says, <hi>is the defence of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
Religion) is concerned;</hi> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, that there have been <hi>many
rebellions</hi> in <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> since
there have been any in which the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
joyned; who for these many years
have given <hi>great testimony</hi> of their <hi>signal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48703:45"/>
and <hi>fidelity</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> and
when they were known to have <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which many <hi>Catholicks</hi> did not resist:
And Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> knows that there are many
very learned men amongst them, whose
lives are not reproachable, and whose
writings for the learning contained in
them, and the modesty with which they
are represented, are thought worthy to be
answered by the <hi>reverend Bishops</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and other eminent and learned
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> who are contented to answer
their Arguments and their Allegations
with all possible candor and condescension,
and without any bitterness of language;
and therefore I cannot but lament on the
behalf of our <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>our manners,</hi> and
of the <hi>English tongue,</hi> that the <hi>good spirit of
France,</hi> and the <hi>urbanity</hi> that is there used
in handling Controversies in Religion,
hath not made greater impression upon
Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> who hath lived so many years
amongst them, as might well have dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to have followed their example,
and might have convinced him that <hi>rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of stile</hi> and <hi>impetuosity of words</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
of the highest importance
which can relate to <hi>Religion,</hi> are not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the being a <hi>good Catholick;</hi> and since
he urges the great <hi>liberty</hi> the <hi>Hugonots</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48703:46"/>
joy in <hi>France,</hi> as an argument against the
<hi>severity</hi> (he will call it by a worse name)
of the <hi>Laws</hi> of his <hi>Country,</hi> which forbid
any exercise of the <hi>Romish Religion</hi> in that
Kingdom; he will not take it ill that I
put him in mind, that as the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have
great obligations to his most <hi>Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi>
their true and lawful King, for his
<hi>clemency</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> towards them, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
and protecting them in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and possession of all those rights, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and immunities which are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them by the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> so
they do enjoy no more liberty than by that
Law is due, nor can it be taken from
them without a bare-faced violation of the
Law, which is of no more force to defend
the <hi>Subjects</hi> in their <hi>other possessions,</hi> than
it is to defend the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in the <hi>exercise
of their Religion,</hi> and yet with all this
right and legal title to protection, no <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> dares revile the <hi>Bishops</hi> or
the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> much less the <hi>Religion</hi> that
is established there; nor mention <hi>the Laws</hi>
without <hi>reverence,</hi> or do any thing that is
<hi>scandalous to the government,</hi> or that is not
<hi>allowed</hi> by the <hi>Law;</hi> whereas a <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctine
Monk,</hi> who by being so hath <hi>renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
his <hi>subjection to his King,</hi> by chusing
<hi>other Superiors</hi> for himself, with obedience
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48703:46"/>
to whom, his obedience to the King is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent;
who hath <hi>deserted the Religion,</hi>
and <hi>the Church</hi> in which he hath been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and to which he hath vowed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
(and in that respect cannot but be
less acceptable than those who have never
been subject to it) who is so <hi>obnoxious to
the Laws,</hi> that he cannot securely live one
day, or set his foot in <hi>England;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all which this man hath the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to enter into it, publickly to <hi>defie the
Laws, traduce the Government, treat the
Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>reverend Clergy,</hi> and the
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> that is <hi>established</hi> there <hi>by
Law,</hi> and all the <hi>professors</hi> of it, with
those scoffs, and derision, and contempt,
as if they were <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and if
he had a warrantable mission to convert
them, would not yet in common prudence
and discretion become him, and seems
contrary to any good and Christian inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and all this while in his triumphant
stile, as if he had subdued all <hi>Protestant
Churches,</hi> he complains lamentably of the
cruel <hi>persecution</hi> against <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God be thanked the King hath many
good <hi>Catholick subjects</hi> of another temper
of spirit, who with all duty acknowledge
the goodness and indulgence of the King,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48703:47"/>
in permitting them to live with that ease
and security that they have enjoyed from
the time of his <hi>Majesties blessed restoration,</hi>
without any distinction between them,
and any other of his subjects; and desire
nothing more than the continuance of the
same ease, and protection, and take care
to provide, and warily entertain <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>
of the same <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>grateful spirit.</hi>
Is there one <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of
the <hi>Laity</hi> or the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that hath suffered
in the least degree in his Person, or his
Estate, for being a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many have not gotten by it, who
would not have been considered under any
other title, many men do doubt) since the
time of his Majesties blessed restoration?
Did they ever enjoy the like tranquillity
for a quarter of that time since the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi>
The King looked upon many of
them, as persons who had deserved well
from his <hi>blessed Father</hi> and <hi>himself,</hi> which
cannot be denied, and upon the rest as
<hi>good subjects,</hi> and upon all of them as men
who had <hi>suffered with him,</hi> if not for him,
in the late barbarous times of <hi>Usurpation:</hi>
His Majesty graciously remembred the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
he had found in many <hi>Catholick
Countries,</hi> and from some <hi>Catholick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
who always besought him not to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48703:47"/>
severe to his <hi>Catholick subjects,</hi> when God
should restore them to his protection; and
it was not agreeable to the gentleness and
clemency of his Majesties nature, when
he pardoned all the breach, and contempt,
and violation of the Laws, almost to the
highest and foulest transgressors, upon his
arrival to awaken those Laws for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of his poor <hi>Catholick subjects,</hi>
which upon the matter had slept even in
that <hi>season of Tyranny,</hi> though a more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
power had been exercised for their
ruine, as well as for theirs who had been
most active and faithful to him: And the
<hi>whole Nation</hi> was as well content with
that his Majesties lenity, and did not
think it reasonable that the general and
universal joy, which filled the hearts of
all men with the blessing of the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
should be eclipsed or interrupted by
the tears and sighs of their <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>
neighbours, and that they who had born
their full share in the late persecutions,
should undergo new vexations by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
those penalties which they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to, by Laws which had been necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be provided against them in times
wherein there was more cause to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of them, than they hoped there was,
or would be hereafter: This cannot be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48703:48"/>
denied to be the case of the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> for many years after the
Kings return, until the rude and boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
behaviour of some of them disturbed
the happy calm they all enjoyed, and the
vanity and folly of others made that ill
use of the Kings bounty and generosity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, that they endeavoured to
make it believed that it proceeded not
from <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi> towards their
<hi>persons,</hi> but from <hi>affection</hi> to their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and took upon them to reproach the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> and all who adhered
to it, as if they had been in a <hi>condition</hi> as
well as a <hi>disposition</hi> to oppress it, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
and discountenance all who would
adhere to it, and so alienated the affections
of those, who desired they should not be
disquieted, and kindled a jealousie in
others, who had believed that they were
neither able or willing to disturb the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
peace, to think that they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to attempt it, and had more power to
compass it than was discerned: This hath
changed the face of that affair, and even
compelled his Majesty to with-draw that
countenance from them, that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
should have been more propitious to
them, if they had known how modestly
and innocently to have been happy under
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48703:48"/>
the shadow of it; and this mischief the
wisest and the soberest <hi>Catholicks of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have long foreseen would be the effect
of that <hi>petulant</hi> and <hi>unruly spirit</hi> that sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too much amongst them, and did all
they could to restrain it; and Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
shall do well to revolve how much he hath
contributed to this storm, which seems to
have a little shaken the repose they were
in, and to take heed that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> may not undergo more prejudice
from the distempered carriage and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of him and two or three more, (for
no body is incensed against those who
with gravity and sobriety defend and
maintain the Religion they profess) who
have contracted a <hi>scurrilous stile</hi> (that hath
been long laid aside, and declined in such
debates) to exalt themselves in against the
Religion of the Kingdom, and those who
are obliged to defend it, than could be
brought upon them by any combination
of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi>
whom they do likewise as unskilfully to
their purpose irreconcile to them, as if
they could <hi>subdue</hi> the <hi>whole Kingdom,</hi> and
so care not whom they provoke. If the
noise, and clamour, and evil-speaking of
these men do awaken the sleeping Laws to
take that vengeance upon them that they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48703:49"/>
were ordained for, and which yet remain
in that drowzy posture, that their own
modesty may reduce them to the <hi>manners</hi>
of <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> or if the <hi>Kings
mercy</hi> continue as obstinate toward them,
as their <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>provocation,</hi> so that he
thinks fit still to abate the sharp edge of the
Laws towards them, in which very few
men wish his Majestie less merciful, there
are still <hi>other Laws</hi> which the dignity of
his Government will not suffer him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain,
and which are provided to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
those who do their duty, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
passions and insolence of those
who observe no rules of <hi>good behaviour,</hi> and
of <hi>peaceable conversation:</hi> And what may
be inflicted upon them of this kind, will
be unpitied by all <hi>good Catholicks,</hi> and will
never be thought a <hi>persecution</hi> of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
and it may be their <hi>Superiours,</hi> at
least upon their observation to what ill use
they put their tongues, may exact from
them that <hi>silence,</hi> for cherishing whereof,
their <hi>Order</hi> was first instituted, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
only imploy such in their <hi>missions,</hi> as
may return to them again without doing
them any harm, or bringing prejudice to
the Religion they profess.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48703:49"/>
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> thinks he hath a wonderful
advantage against the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
because, he says, <hi>he can find no religious
Orders in it, he cannot hear so much as of one
single person whom he might call a Fanatick,
for leaving the flesh, and the world, to the
end he or she might intirely consecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to God in solitude and exercises of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
prayer, and mortification; and if God
should call any one to such a state of life, there
is an utter want amongst them of instructors,
or instructions proper for it.</hi> I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into any discourse of the benefits, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
or ill uses which are too
often made of those <hi>Monasteries</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
houses</hi> of the <hi>He's</hi> and the <hi>She's:</hi> I have
nothing to say against them, nor do I
doubt that there are amongst them many
persons of <hi>great learning</hi> and <hi>vertue;</hi> and
therefore I shall say no more, but that most
<hi>Catholick Kingdoms</hi> think the number of
them too great, and frequently forbid the
erecting more of them, and the <hi>Popes</hi>
themselves have done the like in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and have dissolved many of them; but I
may say (which is as much as is necessary
to say) that we have no cause to lament
the absence of them in <hi>England,</hi> since any
defects which arise by the want of them,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48703:50"/>
is so abundantly provided by the <hi>noble Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
in both the <hi>Universities,</hi> and the
great <hi>Free-Schools</hi> all so plentifully endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not only for the good <hi>education of Youth</hi>
in all principles of vertue, piety, and good
literature; but for the support of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they are bred, in the improvement of
their parts for the service of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and of their <hi>Country;</hi> insomuch, that it
may be truly said that more <hi>Scholars</hi> are
liberally maintained upon the sole charge
and charity of the several <hi>Founders,</hi> and
greater emoluments assigned for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of learning in <hi>England,</hi> than
can be said of any Kingdom in <hi>Europe,</hi> how
much larger and richer soever; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Common-wealth of Learning</hi> in all
other parts doth think (and with great
reason) that all kinds of Learning are at
this day in as great a heighth and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they have been in any age in any
<hi>Kingdom of the world;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forget, though he doth not care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that himself had his educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in a <hi>Religious house</hi> founded by <hi>Walter
Merton,</hi> where he received a much more
liberal and bountiful education, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
than he hath ever had from S. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;</hi>
and from whence he brought more
learning than he hath found in any other
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48703:50"/>
place that he hath since inhabited, or I
doubt than he hath yet about him. In
this <hi>Religious house,</hi> where I think he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as many years as he hath done since
under a <hi>worse discipline,</hi> he had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and obligation to consecrate himself to
God in as much <hi>solitude</hi> as would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
thereunto, and to exercises of <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Prayer</hi> and <hi>mortification:</hi> He was as
much bound to <hi>chastity,</hi> and to all kind of
<hi>temperance</hi> as the <hi>severe Rules</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi>
of a <hi>magnificent Founder</hi> could oblige him;
and which he was likewise <hi>sworn to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve:</hi>
And I believe he under went as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and a much more beneficial <hi>Noviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
there (in which <hi>silence</hi> likewise was a
part of the <hi>mortification)</hi> as he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
at <hi>Douay,</hi> for I saw him in both
those: It is very true, there, and in all
other Colledges, if they found that the
obligations they were under, were stricter
than they could submit to, they are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to quit those benefits their <hi>Founder</hi>
hath bequeathed them, and to dispose of
themselves according to their inclinations,
otherwise they may enjoy the other to
their lives end, as very many do, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that <hi>solitude,</hi> before the <hi>pleasures</hi> of the
<hi>world:</hi> It is very true that the <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State of England</hi> did by observation and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48703:51"/>
experience find, that <hi>vows</hi> did not make
people <hi>chast,</hi> who would not be restrained
by <hi>conscience</hi> of their <hi>duty to God,</hi> and that
those actions were not worthy the name of
<hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>piety,</hi> (I speak still only of our
own Country) which were the effects of
<hi>force,</hi> and <hi>want of opportunity</hi> to decline
them. In a word, the practice they had
too much testimony and evidence of, made
them conclude that the <hi>mischief</hi> from those
inclosures, constraints, and vows was
greater, and more apparent than the <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi>
and <hi>advantage;</hi> and so they thought not
fit to restrain that <hi>liberty</hi> which <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Nature</hi> did allow to all those persons who
would decline the profit of those <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
in which they were possessed of them,
and betake themselves to another conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of life: And I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
knows that many <hi>learned Catholicks</hi> have
always been, and still are very averse to
those <hi>vows</hi> and <hi>inclosures of Women,</hi> which
seems not to be much favoured by the
Church it self, the constitutions whereof
require a greater number of years than
are now required before they receive the
vail, and whether the scandalous lives of
many <hi>Religious men</hi> abroad brings not a
greater <hi>prejudice</hi> to the Religion they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
than their habit and vows brings <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:48703:51"/>
to it, I leave to his observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The other defect he finds in our Church
of want of <hi>instructors,</hi> and <hi>instructions</hi> for
those, in case God should call any one to
such a state of life in <hi>solitude</hi> and exercises of
<hi>spiritual prayer</hi> and <hi>mortification,</hi> is yet
more strange. Without doubt if God
doth in truth call any one to such a state
of life; he will not leave him destitute of
instruction and instructors, and he may be
very confident if he finds neither of those,
that God hath not called him: Sure
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> cannot forget the names of very
many persons, it may be both <hi>men</hi> and <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
with whom, and in whose conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
he had the honour and the happiness
to spend many years of the most innocent
part of his life; from whose grave and
learned information, and excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
he might have led a life more useful
to God, his Country, and himself; and in
which he would have had less to answer to
all three, than that which he hath since by
worse counsel and example given himself
unhappily to. And for Books I shall not
supply his Catalogue with the names of
many more of the same kind, which he
might as well have mentioned, but I shall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48703:52"/>
put him in mind of the excellent, pious
and devout <hi>Sermons,</hi> which are constantly
preached in <hi>that Church,</hi> much better I
believe than he hath heard in any other
language; and there was no restraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, but if he had liked other <hi>Books of
devotion</hi> better, he might have read the
life of <hi>Mother Teresa,</hi> that abounds in
those <hi>visions</hi> he admires, and that <hi>mystical
Theology</hi> he delights in, and even his own
<hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> if any other man would
have taken the pains to have put it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in that Colledge he was bred in,
with the same liberty he hath done either
ever since, sure <hi>good Books</hi> are not wanting
in that <hi>climate</hi> For <hi>Miracles,</hi> whereof he
says, <hi>we do not pretend to one, not so much as
the curing a Tertian Ague, to testifie that our
Reformation is pleasing to God:</hi> I shall say no
more than I have done: We have <hi>not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
to boast of, and very <hi>good Catholicks</hi>
think they boast of <hi>too many,</hi> and would be
glad to be without the mention of most of
them; and I do believe that very many
pious men of <hi>his Church</hi> do believe that the
restoration of the <hi>Church of England</hi> from
that dust and ruines, to which the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
impiety, and sacriledge of the <hi>late
rebellion</hi> had exposed it, and in which the
<hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> his Majesties <hi>own subjects</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48703:52"/>
more delighted and triumphed to see it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
buried, than any <hi>other Catholicks</hi> did,
is a <hi>greater miracle</hi> of Gods mercy, and
power; and if we make our selves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it, even a testimony of his being
pleased with it, then all those, of which
they brag so much, are an evidence that
he is pleased with what they do. I have
never had the luck to see his <hi>Church Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
which he is offended with the Doctor
for stiling a <hi>great Legend,</hi> which he
knows is the stile given to those Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in all Languages, and he challenges
the Doctor more scornfully to give to the
world a pretty <hi>little legend</hi> of his <hi>reformed
Saints.</hi> The Doctor could very well have
given him as large a list of as extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
persons of most profound learning, and
most exemplary lives of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as any other
<hi>Christian Kingdom</hi> can supply him, who it
may lawfully be presumed since their
deaths have enjoyed those <hi>sacred mansions</hi>
of bliss, which God hath prepared for those
who please him; but we are not ashamed
that our Church is too modest to confer
the sacred <hi>title of Saints</hi> which God hath
reserved to his own only disposal, for them
to whom he had before assigned such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of grace as is answerable to that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48703:53"/>
high station; and doth not receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
nor communicate the power in that
particular, of or to any person or jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon Earth; yet it shall be glad, and
doth pray that all such whom the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> hath presumed to call to that honour,
without any ambition or privity of their
own, may really enjoy the same: And
we do not in the least degree apprehend
the displeasure of God Almighty upon <hi>our
Church,</hi> because it doth with all humility,
and after all possible endeavour to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of his favours, leave the <hi>disposal</hi> of
all the <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>offices,</hi> and <hi>imployments</hi>
in his <hi>own house,</hi> to his own gracious <hi>will</hi>
and <hi>pleasure:</hi> And though we do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know so much of their <hi>modern
Saints,</hi> as to think that they were of the
<hi>same Religion</hi> with us: Yet we do
presume to say that the <hi>primitive Saints</hi>
and <hi>Martyrs</hi> were all as much <hi>our Saints</hi>
and <hi>Martyrs</hi> as <hi>theirs;</hi> that is, that we
are as much of the same faith with those,
as they are: We are as firm in the <hi>Apostles
faith,</hi> who were the <hi>first Saints</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> as they can pretend to be:
We adhere as much to all the <hi>doctrine</hi> they
taught, and endeavour to practise all the
<hi>duties</hi> which are enjoyned by them, as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
and diligently as they do. During
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48703:53"/>
the twelve persecutions, which were the
times when those prodigious <hi>Armies of
Martyrs</hi> for their numbers were levied,
it may lawfully be presumed that very
much the <hi>major part</hi> of them (for those
persecutions raged much more furiously
in the <hi>East,</hi> than in any part of <hi>Europe)</hi>
never heard of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> none
of them professed to have any opinion in
which we differ from them. The <hi>first</hi> and
<hi>only subject</hi> of their <hi>Martyrdom</hi> was, that
they loudly avowed the <hi>birth, passion,</hi> and
<hi>resurrection</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
refusal to <hi>offer sacrifice</hi> to, or to
<hi>acknowledge the power</hi> of the <hi>Pagan Gods;</hi>
and the <hi>last</hi> would have excused them, and
preserved their lives, whatsoever they
had thought of the <hi>other;</hi> so that there
was no other point of controversie in issue,
but whether they were <hi>Christians,</hi> and
their <hi>marvellous,</hi> and without doubt <hi>divine
courage</hi> in affirming that, and asserting
that doctrine so soon after they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of it, and before they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with any other operation of it,
than in their courage to lay down their
lives for it, was the whole <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of their <hi>Martyrdom:</hi> For according to
the best evidence we have of those <hi>dark
times,</hi> and of that <hi>darker affair,</hi> we may
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48703:54"/>
reasonably believe that many thousands of
those <hi>blessed Martyrs</hi> lost their lives within
a day, an hour, or less time, according
as the wild, and brutish rage of the <hi>Iudge</hi>
could find ways for their torture and
execution, after the moment of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
in which the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> of the
<hi>new Christians</hi> to die for their faith, was
little more stupendious than the <hi>implacable
rage</hi> of their persecutors was, in the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the honour of their <hi>Pagan Gods;</hi>
for which the <hi>husband</hi> condemned his <hi>wife,</hi>
the <hi>father</hi> his <hi>son,</hi> the <hi>brother</hi> his <hi>brother,</hi>
and <hi>all relations,</hi> those who were <hi>nearest</hi>
and <hi>dearest</hi> to them, to the most exquisite
torments that could be devised. <hi>Tantum
Religio potuit suadere malorum!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> comes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
all <hi>these Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> to
themselves as their <hi>peculiar Patrons</hi> and
<hi>Advocates,</hi> an evidence cannot easily be
comprehended, except they conclude,
the because they have a power to make,
or to declare Saints, they have likewise a
power to appoint them what they shall do
after they are Saints, which is a <hi>species of
Logick</hi> they make often use of to many pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses:
For our parts we have as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be confident of all the <hi>good offices</hi> they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48703:54"/>
can do us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as the others are;
but because we do not know what their
<hi>province there</hi> is, or whether there be such
a <hi>line of communication,</hi> that they know
what we would have them to do for us,
we acquiesce in a <hi>profound veneration</hi> of
their <hi>lives,</hi> and of their <hi>deaths,</hi> and a <hi>full
confidence</hi> that they do enjoy the reward of
both, without importuning them by any
<hi>particular address</hi> of our own in our behalf;
having an assurance in our selves, that
they will do us all the good they can,
though our ignorance knows not how to
ask it from them, and this is all that <hi>our
Church</hi> informs or instructs us of our duty
and behaviour to Saints. And Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
will not take it ill that I tell him, if his
<hi>Church History</hi> consists in the lives of any
<hi>Welch Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> or of those who
were before the year <hi>six hundred,</hi> as there
were many more before than there were
after, he cannot reckon those to belong to
the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> since he well knows
that before the arrival of <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> there had never been mention
there of the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> but most of the
<hi>Christians</hi> had been long before driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Wales</hi> by the tyranny and power of the
<hi>Pagan Saxons,</hi> who spent their time more
profitably by subduing the other parts of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48703:55"/>
the Kingdom, than they could have done
by pursuing them into those mountains
and narrow retreats, where they could
better have defended themselves: So that
the <hi>British Christians</hi> remained for some
time, in some quiet in those parts, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under the direction of their <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Prelates</hi> in the exercise of the <hi>Christian
Religion,</hi> according to the institutions
which they had received from their first
Planters; and after <hi>Austin</hi> came into this
Island with a worthy, and no doubt a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pious intention, and God blessed him
so much, that he converted a <hi>Pagan King,</hi>
and most of his subjects, who were at that
time only they who lived within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
of <hi>Kent,</hi> which opened a door to him,
and those who succeeded him for a larger
conversion, for which his, and their name
ought always to be mentioned with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and gratitude, as blessed instruments
God used for the good of the Nation,
though they were not the <hi>first Planters</hi> of
<hi>Christianity</hi> in the <hi>Island,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> well
knows; and that when <hi>Austin</hi> desired to
confer with the <hi>British Christians,</hi> and had
two several meetings with their <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Prelates,</hi> they were so much offended
with the proposition he made to them of
their <hi>subjection to the Pope,</hi> that they did
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48703:55"/>
not only positively reject that, but would
not consent to change the course of their
observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> in which they had
always concurred with the <hi>Eastern Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
nor yield to any thing else that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
left they might be thought to have
any respect for the <hi>Pope:</hi> So that I say, if
<hi>his Saints</hi> are before the year <hi>six hundred,</hi>
he hath no claim to them, but must either
be content to be without their <hi>merits</hi> and
<hi>miracles,</hi> or that we may have an equal
share with him, upon our joynt stock of
Christianity, and I hope he hath not in his
History inserted the lives or miracles of
any, which have been left out as explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the reformation of more <hi>ancient
Legends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> seems to imitate
the example of angry women, who think
it lawful to give worse words than they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
which is the natural progress of
choler; he provokes first the Doctor by
reproaching him with the number of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks</hi>
amongst us, to tell him, that there
is <hi>Fanaticism</hi> likewise in many of their
Church, and so mentions the Visions and
Revelations, and Miracles in many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of great esteem amongst them, and
by those pertinent instances puts him into
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48703:56"/>
great wrath: and he again to be revenged
on him will no longer be contented that
we have too many <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in the
Church; but will prove that the very <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>essence</hi> of <hi>our Church it self</hi> and <hi>our
Religion</hi> is <hi>pure putid-Fanaticism.</hi> A man
would have expected upon this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that he should presently have singled
one of the Articles of the Church that is so
founded, but that would have held him
too much to the point, and restrained him
from those wandrings with which he is so
delighted; that would withhold him from
falling upon the person of the Doctor, or
upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi>
with whom no body can blame him for
being angry, for they drove him from the
Church, by driving him from his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Church: And from this
charge upon the Church, without any one
instance he falls again upon the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and <hi>Hugonots of France,</hi> and reckons
up some of the opinions they hold, and
maintain, and then says <hi>(pag. 94.) That
he must take the boldness to tell him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 94.</note> (a great
boldness indeed) <hi>that the Doctor himself
does hold the same, and if he denies it, it is
because he is ignorant of what passes in his
own mind.</hi> Now the Doctor must be lost,
for if his own denial cannot absolve him
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48703:56"/>
from being concluded to be of an opinion,
and Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> knows better of that which
the Doctors ignorance keeps him from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
of what passes in his own mind,
he is to blame if he doth not lade him with
all opinions which he wishes he would
own: But to prove this intricate aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
like a <hi>great Magistrate</hi> he takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to administer many questions to
him, and kindly to make answer to them
on his behalf, and so makes him as arrant
a <hi>Fanatick</hi> as he can wish: Yet after all
this he is compelled to confess, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<hi>That it would be rashness in him to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that the Church of</hi> England <hi>doth ground
her faith upon such a Fanatick principle, as
the Doctor lays; and if the Doctor wrongs
the Church of</hi> England, <hi>he</hi> (good man)
<hi>is unwilling to wrong her with him:</hi> And
in this fit of good nature he makes a kind
of an Apology for the Bishops, who may
be deceived themselves in the Doctors
principles, by the negligence that is used
in licensing Books to the Press, or rather
the Doctors virulence against poor <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
was so highly approved by the grave
<hi>Censor Librorum,</hi> that rather than it should
be hindred from doing mischief to them,
he was content that the <hi>Principles also</hi>
should pass, which utterly destroy the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48703:57"/>
foundations of his own Church, and so
concludes with some instances of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory
care that is taken in the licensing
Books. The <hi>Church of England</hi> cannot
but be now secure, when a <hi>Benedictine
Mark</hi> is so vigilant as to stand Sentinel, that
she may receive no prejudice from her own
Children, and he doth very well to put the
Bishops in mind, that they may be more
solicitous what Books are suffered to be
printed, who have no less obligation upon
them, to look that no lewd <hi>seditious Books</hi>
are sold, as that none such may be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And if this kind advertisement of
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath that operation upon the
Magistrates of all sorts, both the Printers
and Sellers, and it may be the Buyers of
the multitude of <hi>Popish Books,</hi> which are
every day vented with as much freedom
as the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> they of his
own Religion will have new cause to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
his prudence, and acknowledge the
great advantage he hath brought to their
<hi>cause,</hi> by his <hi>pen,</hi> as he hath to their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
by his <hi>modesty</hi> and his <hi>manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> comes at last after very much
passion, and much more virulence against
the poor <hi>Protestants,</hi> than the Doctor hath
expressed against the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48703:57"/>
a matter of importance indeed, in which
he believes (which might have kept him
from triumphing so soon) he is absolute
master of the field, and that is to peace and
unity, which, he says, <hi>is more fit to be the
subject and argument of writings composed by
Ecclesiastical persons, that is, unity of faith
and doctrine, (pag.</hi> 102.)<note place="margin">Pag. 102.)</note> and in truth who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is really an enemy even to that unity
of faith and doctrine, (how hard soever
to be attained) must be an enemy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
but I must tell him too, that the
writings of <hi>Ecclesiastical persons</hi> have not
hitherto in any age contributed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of that unity; I mean such who
have a pride &amp; petulancy of understanding,
&amp; obstinacy of will, that will suffer nothing
to be called peace and unity, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of all other men to their dictates.
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and his <hi>Ecclesiastical Friends</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and insolently prescribe a <hi>unity</hi> that is
neither <hi>practicable nor desirable,</hi> and there
are other <hi>Ecclesiastical persons</hi> as humorous,
who are such enemies to unity, that they
think it not necessary to peace, especially
in <hi>Ecclesiastical matters</hi> (that is in matters
of Religion) all men may think, and speak,
and do what they please, and upon the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationality
of these last, the former impute
all the folly, and all the madness that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48703:58"/>
would introduce the most uncontroulable
confusion, to those who observe order and
discipline with more regularity and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
than any of the pretenders will do.
It must not therefore be the <hi>Ecclesiastical
persons,</hi> who have given each other too ill
words to be of one mind, who can procure
this unity of faith and doctrine, that must
constitute this peace; but it must be the
writings and actions of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who
by the execution of those Laws and rules,
which the wisdom of the State for which
they are made, have provided for that
purpose, can infallibly establish that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and peace that is necessary for it: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
who do not pretend any jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
out of their own limits, nor will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
those who live within it to be disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
much less to revile the Laws which
are provided for the publick peace: Where
there are no Laws, confusion is necessary
and natural, and where the Laws are not
executed, it is as unavoidable, and in
some degree necessary: So that where
unity is not as much provided for as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for peace, it is the <hi>Magistrates</hi>
fault, and not the fault of <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi>
who can only prosecute it by the ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the Laws. I say where unity
is necessary; for nothing is more mistaken,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48703:58"/>
or more misapplied, than this precious
word <hi>Unity:</hi> Who doth not know, or
hath not had it frequently in his observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that men who have the same end af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
several ways which lead to that end,
and he who goes the farthest way about
may possibly come sooner to the end, than
he that believes he goes more directly to
it? However if he comes thither later, he
is liable to no other reproach than being
laughed at for being longer upon the way
than he needed to have been. I knew
<hi>two Gentlemen</hi> of good quality and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
one of which I think is still living,
who were very near neighbours in <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and lived in that good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and conversation, as persons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and authority in their Country use to
do; they had both very frequent occasions
to ride to <hi>London,</hi> and the house of one of
them was the confessed way of the other
thither, but the difference was, whether
from thence the nearest way was by <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi>
or by <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> and in that they
were so great <hi>Opiniators,</hi> that they still
parted at the door, and one took the one
way, and the other that which he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be nearest, and in twenty years
they never made the journey together.
How light soever the instance seems to be,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48703:59"/>
it will be found fit enough to be applied to
very many differences of opinion, which
by the <hi>excess of fancy</hi> on the one side, and
the <hi>defect of judgment</hi> of the other, are
blown up into a magnitude that dazles the
eyes of too many spectators; and for the
determination of the rest, there wants not
a submission and obedience to authority;
the difference only is where that authority
is placed to which obedience ought to be
paid. We of the <hi>Church of England</hi> hold
ours to be due to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi>
and the <hi>Law:</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> would have us
pay it to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which we cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to, not because he is <hi>fallible,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is not a <hi>Magistrate</hi> who hath any
jurisdiction over us. In matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Religion, we resort to the <hi>Articles of
the Church,</hi> which we are obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to: He would have us observe the
<hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> which we
are forbidden to do, and he as an <hi>English
Catholick</hi> is not bound to, upon which we
shall enlarge hereafter; and this election
to believe that the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
which flourishes at least as much in learned
and pious men, as any Church of the
world, can better direct <hi>English-men</hi> in
the way to Heaven, than the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> is the greatest use we make of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48703:59"/>
our reason which is not like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p>What that union is that was intended
certainly by our Saviour, when he left his
Church established under spiritual Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
will best appear by the rules he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
and the directions he gave in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereunto, which we may lawfully
believe he never intended for such a unity,
as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and his friends dream of, and
that he foresaw the same could never be,
and depended more upon what was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
towards it upon the <hi>civil Magistrates,</hi>
than upon the <hi>Ecclesiastical power.</hi> He
prescribed the <hi>essential principles</hi> himself of
that Religion which he intended should be
established, and left persons trusted by him
who not only knew his mind, but knew
all things which are necessary to be known
for the accomplishment of it. And no
<hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>spiritual authority</hi> under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hath power to alter any thing that was
setled by him or his Apostles, who were
the <hi>only Commentators</hi> intrusted by him to
explain whatsoever might seem doubtful
in what himself had said, and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
their parts with that plainness in
what is necessary, that there remains no
difficulty to men of very competent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understandings,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48703:60"/>
and it is as plain that they
did not affect such a <hi>unity in opinions,</hi> as
these men would perswade us. If we will
believe <hi>our Saviour</hi> himself, even after his
<hi>Resurrection;<note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> He that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
shall be saved.</hi> What is this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
belief that is required with such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
benefit and reward? Nothing
but the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> he that believeth the
Resurrection, and is baptized into that
faith shall be saved. The only cause of our
Saviours appearing at that time, was only
to upbraid <hi>his Disciples</hi> with their <hi>unbelief,
and hardness of heart,<note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> because they believed
not them which had seen him after he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen;</hi>
he was not offended with them for
not believing it upon the word of several
of the Prophets, nor upon his own, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so often, and so clearly declared to
them that he should rise, and even the
time when; how essential a point
soever it was in the Religion he had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it had such a repugnancy to humane
reason and understanding, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended they should devest themselves
of, that he was not angry that they did
not suddenly believe it: He well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> who could not
but know much of Christ when he first
saw him,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 14.</note> and said, <hi>I have need to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48703:60"/>
of thee, and comest thou to me?</hi> and
when at his Baptism, which out of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he administred to him, <hi>the Heavens
were opened, and the spirit of God descended
like a Dove, and lighted upon him, and a
voice from Heaven said, This is my beloved
Son,</hi> &amp;c. Yet after all this S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was
so far from being clearly confident, that
he whom he had baptized was really our
Saviour, that being in prison, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the works done by him, he sent two
of his Disciples, asking him, <hi>Art thou he
that should come, or do we look for another?</hi>
And after S. <hi>Peter</hi> had confessed that <hi>he
was Christ, the Son of the everliving God,</hi>
and had seen him (together with <hi>Iames</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi>) transfigured upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and had heard the voice from the
cloud, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 9. 10.</note> yet neither
of them could understand what the rising
from the dead should mean: And S. <hi>Luke</hi>
tells us, that when our Saviour informed
the whole twelve at his going up to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
of all things that were written by
the Prophets concerning him, and which
were then to be accomplished, <hi>That he
should be delivered to the Gentiles, and should
be mocked, and spightfully intreated and
spitted on, and that they should scourge him,
and put him to death, and the third day he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48703:61"/>
should rise again:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 18. 34.</note> They (the whole
twelve) understood none of these things,
and this saying was hid from them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew they the things which were
spoken; Christ himself thought it not fit
to explain that most important point to
them, well knowing that in that point
of his Resurrection, they must have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
assistance to their faith than his own
words could give them; and therefore we
see how long it was before that Article
could gain belief even after his actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and how there he condescended
to convince their senses in all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before he could obtain their belief in
that point, which concerned them more
than all the rest, nor could less than the
descent of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> finish that part of
the Creed, and propagate that doctrine:
But when he had vouchsafed after his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
to be seen, and to be conferred
with, taken the way to satisfie their senses
which could not be deceived, and which
could not but challenge and compel their
belief, that they should not yet believe
seemed obstinacy and perverseness, it was
not only infidelity, but ill nature, incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and hardness of heart, want of that
charity which he had so often, and so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
enjoyned them to practise, not to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48703:61"/>
believe those who had seen him, and
whom he had sent to inform them. This
was a countermine to blow up the doctrine
of his Resurrection, if men contemned the
only evidence that could be given of it, if
they resolved they would not believe them
who had seen him dead, and buried, and
seen him after he was risen, they might
as well not believe their own eyes when
themselves should see him, that he added
a terrible commination to his <hi>short Creed:
He that believeth and is baptized, shall be
saved, but he that believeth not shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
Now they knew the reward, and
the penalty, they might chuse for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
S. <hi>Paul</hi> did inlarge this <hi>Creed</hi> very
little in his gloss upon it:<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 9</note> 
               <hi>If thou shalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt
believe in thy heart that God hath raised him
from the dead, thou shalt be saved:</hi> We
must publickly own and avow our faith,
not dissemble our Christianity out of any
worldly consideration, out of hope to gain,
or out of fear of danger: S. <hi>Peter</hi> never
denied his faith in Christ, lost nothing of
his reverence for him, he did only not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
with his mouth his relation to him,
denied he had been in his company, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least disaffection in his heart, and
it cost him so many tears, and remains as a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48703:62"/>
brand upon him to the end of the world,
of his unkindness to his master; his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him that he might see what they
would do to him, and be at hand to assist
him if he stood in any need of his service,
when all the rest left him, to provide for
their own security, could not expiate for
not confessing his relation to him, though
impertinently urged by those who had no
authority to make the enquiry; we must
always confess with our mouth, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he is the Son of God; we must
believe the <hi>History</hi> of his <hi>Nativity,</hi> of his
<hi>Passion,</hi> and of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> all which
he hath manifested unto us himself, we
have it from his own mouth, and we have
done our part.</p>
            <p>If an exact knowledge in all particulars
contained in Scripture were required from
us, or if it had been in any great degree
necessary, there would have been more
pains, and care taken by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who
were enlightened to make a <hi>short Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
upon the whole <hi>Christian faith</hi> by <hi>Gods
own spirit,</hi> and were endued with the <hi>spirit
of Prophecy,</hi> and so could foresee what
doubts were most like to arise by the excess
of wit, as well as the weakness of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
to have determined &amp; defined
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48703:62"/>
those things, in defining and determining
whereof so much time hath been since
spent, and so much uncharitableness infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into the hearts of men, so that instead
of learning more of what Christ would
have us know, we have almost unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all that he would have us do; yet
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as if he foresaw that that <hi>Original
corruption</hi> and <hi>itch of knowledge</hi> would be
propagated by the curiosity of mankind,
begun his preaching in his masters me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
that they might not be terrified
with any imagination of the difficulty of
his doctrine, he declared that <hi>that which
may be known of God, was manifest to them,
for God had shewed it to them:</hi> There are no
doubt many things fit to be known, and
which we should be the better for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which are not so manifest, but it is
not so necessary if it be not manifest; and
it is very observable, that when he tells
them what became of those under the Law,
and the sins of the Gentiles, who did not
<hi>like to retain God in their knowledge,</hi> he
mentions not what false opinions grew up
amongst them by reason of their not reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him in their knowledge,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 29, 30.</note> but that
<hi>God gave them over to a reprobate mind to
do those things which were not convenient:
Being filled with all unrighteousness, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48703:63"/>
wickedness, covetousness, malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
full of envy, murther, debate, deceit,
malignity, whisperers, back-biters, haters of
God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors
of evil things, disobedient to Parents:</hi> He
doth not so much as mention their <hi>Idolatry</hi>
in that place, because it was matter of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which was the greatest contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Majesty of God, but those vices
which had proved destructive to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
relation and society; and the same
Apostle finding still that the <hi>infant Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
perplexed themselves with many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
between the Law and the Gospel,
took the pains as <hi>Moses</hi> had done, to
abridge the obligations of the Law, as
was mentioned before to abridge the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the Gospel: <hi>If thou shalt confess
with thy mouth the Lord Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 9</note> aud shalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in thy heart that God hath raised him
from the dead, thou shalt be saved:</hi> He that
cordially believes the History of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
That he was the only begotten Son of
God, that he suffered death for the sins of
mankind, and that after he was put to
death, and buried, he rose the third day;
the birth, and death, and resurrection of
Christ hath faith sufficient to salvation,
and all that is absolutely necessary to be
believed, lies within that narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48703:63"/>
Notwithstang the clearness of which
definition and authority of the Apostle,
the <hi>wit of men,</hi> and even the <hi>zeal of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
produced many <hi>differences of opinion,</hi> and
<hi>much faction</hi> amongst the believers, many
men thinking that this excellent foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would very well support this manner
of building, and others that it would as
well or better bear another sort of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rather this deduction than that
would result from the same proposition,
S. <hi>Paul</hi> still adhering fast to the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without much examining the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures,
tells them, <hi>Other foundation
can no man lay, than that is laid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>which is
Iesus Christ:</hi> If they would keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
steddy to that foundation, let their
superstructures be of <hi>gold or silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, or stubble,</hi> let their
conceptions or deductions be of the finest
allay, the more <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> or
more <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>irrational,</hi> there will at last
be such an examination of every one of
them, that the truth shall appear and be
made manifest; but for their comfort, to
abate the superciliousness of him who hath
more reason to think himself <hi>in the right,</hi>
and to raise the spirits of them who may be
terrified with the consequence of being <hi>in
the wrong,</hi> he tells them, that they who
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48703:64"/>
have done their work best, raised such
doctrine upon, and from the <hi>foundation,</hi>
as will endure the trial, that doctrine shall
stand, and they shall receive a reward;
and that they who have built less skilfully,
raised imaginations too large, or contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
opinions too narrow to be supported up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that foundation, their doctrine shall not
subsist, their opinions shall be disavowed,
and condemned; yet because they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not from the foundation, let their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
and errors in judgment be what they
will, they themselves shall be saved; nor
did he think the determination of those
buildings, how different soever, and vile
the materials might seem to be, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the judgment of any but the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builder,
the Architect who had directed
the foundation, who could only judge
whether there were malice or hypocrisie in
preparing such superstructures to rest upon
that foundation:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore judge nothing
before the time, until the Lord come:</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
takes upon him to judge before,
presumes to judge before the cause is ripe
for judgment, which is not only beside the
office of an upright Judge, but against the
rules of Justice; and it was very <hi>good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi>
as well as <hi>wisdom</hi> in the Master in
the parable, who though he saw the Tares,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48703:64"/>
Tares not grown up by chance out of the
rankness of the soil, but Tares maliciously
and industriously sown by the labour and
craft of an Enemy, would not suffer his
active servants to pull them up, he reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the providence; <hi>Nay lest whilst you ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up the Tares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>ye root up also the Wheat
with them, let them both grow until the
Harvest:</hi> And lest men should think by the
ripeness of the Tares that the harvest was
come, our Saviour himself interprets his
own parable; <hi>The Harvest is the end of
the world, and the Reapers are the Angels;</hi>
an unskilful hand will mistake the Wheat
for Tares, and a rude passionate hand will
for expedition pull up both, that he may
be sure he hath destroyed one; <hi>unskilful</hi>
and <hi>unlearned men</hi> may believe that to be
an error which in truth is none,
but enough consistent with the truth, and
<hi>angry men</hi> will not enough consider if it be
in truth an error, what root it may have
taken from some unquestionable truth,
and how far it may have insinuated it self
into the minds of good and pious men,
which ought to be undeceived by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and gentle remedies, and by time,
but will violently tear it from the hold it
had, and make a greater wound than they
found; disturb the peace of a Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48703:65"/>
rather than connive at an error till it be
ripe, and the mischief thereof fully disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and when the <hi>malice of the disease</hi> is
evident, <hi>proportionable remedies</hi> may more
easily be found. Our Saviour was not
more careful of the <hi>season</hi> than of the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;</hi>
the <hi>season</hi> is the <hi>end of the world,</hi> the
<hi>Reapers</hi> are the <hi>Angels;</hi> dispassionate and
unpartial Reapers, who understand the
nature of the Tares, and the hurt they
have done to the Corn. It is a complaint
and observation as ancient as S. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 9. Ep. 39.</note>
               <hi>Quam multi sunt fidelium qui imperito zelo
succenduntur, &amp; saepe, dum quosdam quasi
Haereticos insequuntur haereses faciunt?</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and discretion can only preserve men
from splitting upon those rocks, and the
time prescribed in the parable can only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
all disputations.</p>
            <p>It seems an expression of a wonderful
latitude which S. <hi>Paul</hi> uses to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 15, 18.</note>
               <hi>Some indeed preach Christ even of
envy and strife, and some also of good will;</hi>
what then? <hi>Notwithstanding every way,
whether in pretence or in truth Christ is
preached, and I therein do rejoyce, yea, and
will rejoyce:</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> found opposition and
contradiction (as all other Preachers have
done since) even from some other Apostles
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48703:65"/>
and Disciples; <hi>emulation</hi> was a <hi>strong pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
and well grown in the <hi>infancy of the
Church,</hi> and did no great harm: No
doubt S. <hi>Paul</hi> wished that all who were to
preach <hi>Christ</hi> had had the same thoughts,
and had used the same words, and had had
the same affection towards each other;
which unity would much have advanced
the <hi>propagation of Christianity;</hi> but he knew
<hi>that</hi> was impossible, and that <hi>different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi>
and <hi>different conceptions</hi> must be
always attended with <hi>difference of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
whilst the <hi>birth,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi>
and <hi>resurrection of Christ</hi> was taught,
though they who preached him had their
own passions and prejudices towards each
other, he was still glad that the number
of the Christians were increased. There
may be much good done in the world
without taking its rise purely from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and only to please others, or to
imitate others; and the like may be done
to anger, and to cross and contradict other
men; and though the Authors of that good
have lost their reward, yet there is matter
of rejoycing still that good is done. It is
very well worth our reflexion, how little
pains <hi>our Saviour</hi> took (who well
foresaw what disputations would arise
concerning Religion to the end of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48703:66"/>
world) to explain any <hi>doctrinal points,</hi> or
indeed to institute any thing of <hi>speculative
doctrine</hi> in his <hi>Sermon upon the Mount,</hi>
which comprehends all Christianity, but
to resolve all into practice; and his <hi>Apostles</hi>
though they met with a world of <hi>questions</hi>
and <hi>disputes,</hi> and in the highest points of
the <hi>mystery of Religion,</hi> were very short in
their <hi>answers</hi> and <hi>determination,</hi> and left
no room for any contention in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
upon any matter of faith, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
purely upon believing what was
past and done, and of which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unquestionable evidence; but in the
application of this faith to practice they
were large in their discourses, and clear to
remove all doubts; they had observed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
how many <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> the <hi>Church
of the Iews</hi> had run by their several <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations</hi>
of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> of
both which they had all <hi>equal veneration,</hi>
and from both gathered arguments enough
to found an animosity against each other,
that vented it self in all the acts of <hi>unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness</hi>
and <hi>denunciation of Hell-fire</hi> to
their opponents, and they did all they
could that the Gospel and the professors
thereof might not be exposed to the like
mischiefs by the same disputations: Men
might set their wits on work to raise
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48703:66"/>
doubts and scruples, and improve them to
what degree they please by the subtilty of
their own invention, they were <hi>difficulties</hi>
of their <hi>own making,</hi> not <hi>finding:</hi> Christ
and his Apostles left their Declarations of
what we are to believe, and what we are
to do, so clearly stated, that we cannot
<hi>dangerously mistake,</hi> and so much the more
clearly by informing us what we are not to
believe, and what we are not to do, by
the obligations of Christianity; and as
they did no doubt foresee the <hi>weakness</hi> and
the <hi>wilfulness</hi> of the <hi>succeeding times,</hi> and
that men would make use of the <hi>Scriptures
themselves</hi> to the <hi>prejudice of Religion,</hi> they
took care that they might know that there
is much in them <hi>above their understanding,</hi>
and that they should govern themselves by
what is <hi>easie</hi> &amp; <hi>plain to be understood</hi> therein:
and above all, that they should not presume
to <hi>censure</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> those who <hi>differ</hi> from
them in their <hi>opinions,</hi> because Christ hath
reserved all those differences to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by himself, and except it were inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ecclesiastical censures</hi> upon <hi>corruption of
manners,</hi> and <hi>transgressing</hi> against <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
duties:</hi> It was some Ages before the
Church expressed any great <hi>severity</hi> upon
<hi>differences in opinions,</hi> and used such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection
in the expressions upon their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48703:67"/>
determinations, as rather pleased all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concerned, than strictly defined the
matter in controversie: The <hi>Primitive
Church</hi> never prescribed any <hi>other rule</hi> to
themselves to judge by, than the <hi>sacred
Scriptures,</hi> by consent of which they made
all their definitions and determinations:
and as no man yet, at least with any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of authority, hath pretended to
understand the intire meaning of any one
of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> so it was some time (a
long time) before the <hi>Revelation of S. Iohn</hi>
was received into the <hi>Canon of the Church</hi>
for the difficulty of it; and whosoever
hath since undertaken to understand it,
hath received <hi>more censure</hi> than <hi>approbation</hi>
from pious and learned men, nor have
they attained to credit enough to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<hi>Seek not out the things that are too
hard for thee, neither search the things that
are above thy strength,</hi> is very good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
and proportioned to mens different
faculties and understandings; he that is
<hi>stronger</hi> than I may search for things that
are too hard for me, and there is no harm
in that search, but I who am <hi>weaker,</hi> am
in no degree obliged to make that search,
nor shall fare the worse because I am so
weak. The <hi>Dialogue</hi> between the <hi>Angel</hi>
and the <hi>Prophet Esdras</hi> may be very good
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48703:67"/>
Divinity, thoughs it be contained in the
<hi>Apocrypha;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Esa. 4.</note> 
               <hi>He that dwelleth above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
may only understand the things that are
above the heighth of the Heavens;</hi>
               <note place="margin">21. 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>The more
thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel,
for the world hasteth fast to pass away, and it
cannot comprehend the things that are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the righteous in time to come:</hi> Let us
endeavour to do the things which we are
plainly enjoyned to do, and which we can
very well comprehend, at least let us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
doing any thing which we are as
plainly forbidden to do, and we shall in
due time obtain those things which for the
present we cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p>It hath been an artifice introduced to
perplex mankind, and to work upon the
conscience, by amusing and puzling the
understanding, to perswade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there is but <hi>one Church,</hi> and <hi>one
Religion</hi> in which men may be saved, that
by their confident averring themselves to
be <hi>that Church,</hi> and of <hi>that Religion,</hi> others
may be prevailed with to be of <hi>their party,</hi>
and they who with most passion abhor
their presumption, and so withdraw from
their Communion, adhere to the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
conclusion, and will not suffer
them to be a <hi>Church at all,</hi> or capable of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48703:68"/>
salvation, and form <hi>their own Church</hi> upon
those principles only which most <hi>contradict
the other;</hi> whereas there is room enough
in Heaven for them all, and we may chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
and reasonably believe, that many
of all <hi>Christian Churches</hi> will come thither,
and that too many of every one of them
will be excluded from thence. There is
indeed, as was said before, but <hi>one faith,</hi>
which no authority upon Earth can
change, or suspend, or dispence with; but
<hi>Religion,</hi> which is the uniting, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united of pious men in the profession
of that Faith, may be exercised in <hi>several</hi>
and <hi>different forms,</hi> and <hi>ways,</hi> and with
<hi>several ceremonies</hi> according to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
and rules of the <hi>several Countries</hi>
and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> where it is practised, and
there are so many Churches united in <hi>one</hi>
and the <hi>same faith;</hi> and methinks the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
stile and appellation used by the <hi>Apostles
themselves,</hi> should discountenance and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
that quarrelsome proposition to the
<hi>Church of,</hi> or <hi>at Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> at
<hi>Philippi,</hi> and other places, to the <hi>seven
Churches of Asia;</hi> and it is observable that
the Apostles in their method of writing
and prescribing their <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> to the
<hi>several Churches,</hi> have a regard to the <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi>
and <hi>natures</hi> of the <hi>several people,</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48703:68"/>
permit some things, and for some time in
<hi>one place,</hi> and to one <hi>People,</hi> which they do
not to <hi>another;</hi> they who succeeded them
followed their example, and did not only
permit, but encourage the People to all
actions, which they perceived did really
contribute to, and improve their <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and so many things which afterwards
degenerated into <hi>Superstition,</hi> had their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
from <hi>fervent piety,</hi> and <hi>innocent
Devotion,</hi> as some <hi>kinds of Worship</hi> and
<hi>Forms of Adoration,</hi> and an over easie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Miracles,</hi> when there seemed less
danger in that fervour which inflamed
them, than might have been in extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
that good Fire that warmed them,
by an over severe examining, and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Fewel that had kindled it. It is
an unanswerable argument of the truth of
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi>
that being so different from all things
then known to Mankind, and so much
contradicting the very Principles of their
belief, and knowledge in very many
things, it should in so short a time possess
the hearts of so many Millions of People
of all <hi>Nations,</hi> of both Sexes, and of <hi>all
Religions;</hi> and as God did miraculously
prepare, and dispose the hearts of men to
the <hi>reception of their faith;</hi> so as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48703:69"/>
means to that operation, he infused
likewise into them a <hi>profound reverence</hi>
for the <hi>Persons</hi> of those who <hi>published this
Faith,</hi> and informed the People of the
<hi>mysteries,</hi> and instructed them in the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it</hi> towards the Apostles, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those who succeeded them, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
their Orders, and followed their
examples; this <hi>Universal esteem</hi> of such
Persons amongst all Christians, created
such an <hi>implicit belief</hi> in all they <hi>said,</hi> and
so <hi>intire a submission</hi> to all they <hi>required,</hi>
that Men were not less guided by them in
all the affairs of <hi>humane life,</hi> than in their
determinations of the most spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which related to their <hi>Conscience;</hi>
and this general resignation continued in
a great degree, until Religion grew to be
a <hi>faction,</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> amongst Christians
themselves, and the preaching it a <hi>Trade</hi>
to live, and to grow rich by, and Men stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
it for <hi>preferment,</hi> and practised it for
<hi>profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That unreasonable, inconvenient, and
mischievous distinction of <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi>
and <hi>Temporal,</hi> as it exempts things, and
Persons from the <hi>Civil Iustice,</hi> and the
<hi>Soveraign Authority,</hi> and as it erects <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Tribunal,</hi> and sets up another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48703:69"/>
               <hi>Soveraign Iurisdiction</hi> Superiour, and
independant upon the other, hath cost the
Christian World very dear in Treasure,
and in blood, and hath almost heaved that
Government (which ought to preserve
the order, and peace of <hi>Christendom)</hi> off the
Hinges. That there are offences, and
crimes of an <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual
Nature,</hi> according to the manner, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of speaking, and Persons who by
their Functions, to which they are assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
properly, fall under the same distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is very true, and very reasonable; but
that any such <hi>difference</hi> in the <hi>appellation,</hi>
should create a <hi>Schisme</hi> in the <hi>Government,</hi>
that the <hi>civil justice</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> should
not have the <hi>full cognisance</hi> of <hi>either,</hi> and
<hi>both,</hi> but that an other <hi>Supreme,</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Iurisdiction</hi> should examine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
those things, and have the only
authority to regulate, reform, and punish
those Persons, is such a solecisme, such a
contradiction, indeed such a dissolution of
all the principles, and substantial frame of
Government, that there is not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
left to prevent the highest, and most
dismal confusion that can be imagined;
for if the <hi>same Treason</hi> may not be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
before the <hi>same Tribunal,</hi> because
of the difference, and distinction of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48703:70"/>
Persons who are guilty of it, if the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power</hi> over the Nation have only
power to judge, and condemn the <hi>Laymen</hi>
who Rebel, and the Clergy which hath fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
it, the Church-men who have
preached it up as lawful, and necessary, and
justifiable, may appeal from that justice to
<hi>another jurisdiction,</hi> which it may be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
good success to that undertaking, which
is now condemned, however will not be
obliged to the same rules of judging, which
were to confess it self inferiour; Is it not
possible that the same offence may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and justified, and one Man legally
commended, and preferred for the same
action for which the other is censured and
executed? <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> can never
be the <hi>Nursing Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Nursing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
of the Church, if they themselves
shall be kept as Children in the <hi>Nursery</hi>
of the <hi>Vicar</hi> of that Church, if he shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
a Soveraignty above the Soveraignty
they have in their own Dominions. <hi>Aaron</hi>
had a function of his own Offices to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
which were proper to him, and to his
Tribe after him, but he was inferiour to
<hi>Moses, Moses</hi> had the power over him, and
it was well he had so; had it been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
he who was so ready to gratifie the
people in their impious desire of having
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48703:70"/>
Gods to walk before them, and had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excuse for not only <hi>permitting,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving</hi>
their <hi>abominable Idolatry,</hi> but that
the people were set on mischief, and said
unto him, <hi>make us Gods,</hi> and he said unto
them, <hi>whoever hath any Gold, let them break
it off, so they gave it, he cast it into the Fire
and out came the Calf,</hi> which they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
before the Altar which he built before
it; what would not this Man have done
that the People would have required, and
if <hi>Moses</hi> had not been the <hi>Soveraign</hi> to have
examined, and punished this foul transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
<hi>Idolatry</hi> had probably been <hi>established,</hi>
as a Law by God's <hi>own High Priest,</hi> and as
by his <hi>own Commandement;</hi> He who had
the presumption to <hi>murmur,</hi> and <hi>speak</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Moses</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> did,<note place="margin">Numb. 12. 1.</note> would have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled</hi>
against him, if God himself had not
given him such a reprehension as made him
tremble, <hi>Wherefore were you not afraid to
speak against my Servant Moses?</hi> the speech
was but between two, but it would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been stilled, if God had not stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
their Mouths, and struck his joynt
murmurer with Leprosie, and sent him to
ask mercy of <hi>Moses.</hi> It is no undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the persons, or their functions, to say it
were better for the <hi>Successors of Aaron,</hi> and
for the <hi>Successors of St. Peter,</hi> and for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48703:71"/>
               <hi>things</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> which are committed
to their charge, if they, as their <hi>Predecessors</hi>
were, were subject to a <hi>superiour visitation,</hi>
which is more like, and more able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
things as they grow amiss, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
dangerous innovations in Church, as
well as in the State; and surely that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power which is trusted by God to
provide for the peace and prosperity, and
security of a Nation, if it cannot as well
prevent, and punish those enormities which
grow up in the <hi>Church,</hi> from the corruption
of Doctrine, and contentions, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
in the <hi>practice of Religion,</hi> as any
exorbitancies in <hi>state,</hi> is so far from being
<hi>soveraign,</hi> that he holds upon the matter
the little authority he hath in other things,
but <hi>precariò</hi> of him who hath the exercise
of the <hi>other jurisdiction.</hi> And as this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and confusion is very demonstrable
to all men who understand the foundation,
and rules of Policy, and Government, so
the benefits which accrew from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
are not discernable by the eyes of
<hi>reason,</hi> or of <hi>faith. Temporal Princes, and
Kings cannot have authority to change Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
nor are qualified to perform the Offices,
and functions of Religion;</hi> that's true. Nor
hath any <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual power</hi>
authority to change Religion; The <hi>Pope</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48703:71"/>
whom some Men call <hi>the Church,</hi> nor a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council,</hi> which no doubt is the most
natural representative of the <hi>Universal
Church,</hi> doth not pretend that they can
<hi>change Religion; Our Saviour</hi> left our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
intire, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> left all things
so plain which he directed, that no power
under Heaven can add to, or take from
that body of Religion, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to all Christians; nor can it be
more reasonably imagined that God will
suffer any <hi>Christian state</hi> to make such an
alteration, than that the <hi>Universal Church</hi>
shall fall away from being <hi>Christian:</hi> but if
<hi>Christianity</hi> were deposited with <hi>one Church-man,</hi>
or any <hi>body of Church-men,</hi> we have
too much reason to apprehend what would
become of it, by the progress <hi>Arianisme</hi>
once, and <hi>other Heresies</hi> too made in the
World by possessing many great, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, even of the <hi>Fathers themselves.</hi>
So that we may say, that the purity of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion</hi> hath been in truth preserved
by the piety of <hi>Princes,</hi> with the advice,
and assistance of their <hi>National,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Councils,</hi> more than by any <hi>spiritual
authority.</hi> Religion it self then must not,
cannot be changed, but the advancement
of it, the information in it, the exercise,
and practice by which it is best to be made
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48703:72"/>
manifest, cannot be so well provided for,
as by that <hi>supreme soveraign authority</hi> to
which God hath intrusted the peace, and
prosperity of a Nation, which best knows
how to establish such <hi>formes,</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi>
and <hi>circumstances</hi> in what pertains to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as are most agreeable to the nature,
and inclination, and disposition of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
A conformity in humours and in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
is a great introduction to conformity
in Religion, and will not suffer the pride,
and affectation, and singularity of any man
to contradict the order established. This
<hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> knows best how to
preserve Peace, in which the being of a
Nation consists, and how to reform errors
which are grown, and prevent those which
are growing, by such ways as may not
disturb that peace; and such errours as are
grown too obstinate, are too deep rooted
to be pulled up without shaking the whole
peace of the Kingdom, he will let alone,
drawing by degrees such nourishment from
it, as most cherishes it, until a fitter season
for the intire cure of it. No <hi>Reformation</hi>
is worth the charge of a <hi>Civil War;</hi> Nor
was it a light reproach which <hi>Seneca</hi>
charged upon <hi>Sylla, Qui patriam durio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
remediis quam pericula erant, sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit;</hi>
The Remedy was worse than the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48703:72"/>
Disease, and God knows Christianity hath
paid very dear for the too hasty and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
application of remedies to very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
diseases, when the disease was not
ripe for the remedy, nor the remedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the disease. State surgery can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be used with too much caution, nor are
the wounds, and sores of it cured at once,
or with one kind of medicine, but the leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and corrosives must be applied succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
and if the first will do it, there cannot
be too little used of the latter; No sore is so
ill cured, as that which is hastily cured.
There is no necessity, nor convenience that
the outward exercise, and forms of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be the same in all climates, and in all
Countries; Nay, it is very necessary that it
be different, according to the natures, and
customes of the people. It would be very
incongruous where <hi>genuflexion</hi> is neither
the posture of reverence or devotion, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
a command for <hi>kneeling;</hi> and there
are many particulars worthy of the same
consideration. They do equally mistake, who
believe that the <hi>out-works of Religion</hi> must
be equally, &amp; with the same passion guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and preserved, as the <hi>walks themselves,</hi>
that no form, or ceremony, or circumstance
in Religion may not be altered or parted
with, more than the faith it self, and they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48703:73"/>
who would be always mending, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and reforming according to every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
&amp; description they meet with, as a thing
indifferent, and only to please the fancies of
men where there is no indifference; there
may be alterations made by, and according
to the wisdom of the Government, and as
the good Order, and peace of the Nation
requires, and with the same gravity, and
deliberation as all other mutations, and
provisions are made; but there must be
<hi>out-works</hi> still, and such as may secure the
walls from rude approaches; every <hi>fanciful
Engineer</hi> must not demolish the out-works
upon pretence they are too high, or too ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular,
nor must the decency of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
so much transport others, as not to
suffer the least alteration in them, though
thereby the walls would be the better gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
No one Classis of men will dispas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
weigh all necessary consideration
in this matter, but that authority which
must provide for the publick peace, is
the most competent provider for this
branch of it. It is no irreverence to the
purest times, to believe that in the <hi>first
plantation</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> (I speak
not of infusion of Christian Religion
into the Apostles, and the inspiration
by the Holy Ghost, but of the plantation
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48703:73"/>
of it by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and those who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them, by the strength of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the powerful effects of their lives,
and actions) the same method, and order,
and application was used and observed as
is in <hi>other Plantations:</hi> The Sun and the
Soil are first consulted, and husbandry
practised accordingly in the sowing of
Seeds or setting of Plants, and that hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
altered and improved according to
seasons, and upon observation and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
what is most like to advance the
Plantation. If ever the <hi>Spaniard</hi> loses the
<hi>West Indies</hi> (which it is probable enough
he will do) it will be by his positive and
rigorous adhering to the same rules which
were most prudently established by <hi>Philip
the Second</hi> upon the first conquest of that
Empire, and under which the <hi>Infant
Plantation</hi> prospered exceedingly, and not
admitting any such material alterations
since, as would produce more benefit and
advantage now, than the other did then,
and which time, and the people will make,
if the policy of the Government do not first
introduce it, and then it is very hazardous
that the presumption of doing it will shake
off that authority that should have done it.
It may be observed in the <hi>Plantation of
Christianity,</hi> that where the age and the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48703:74"/>
people were most inclined to superstition,
which in the first conversion and growth
of Religion they were not disposed to, at
least to that worship and reverence which
shortly after degenerated into superstition,
there was least care taken to introduce
<hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> into the Church;
but when prophaneness broke in as a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and the lives of Christians discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the doctrine of Christ, and the <hi>power
of Princes</hi> was found necessary to reform
the <hi>manners of the Church;</hi> such Forms
and Ceremonies were brought into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Religion, as were judged most
like to produce a reverence into the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi>
towards it, and to manifest that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
in providing whereof <hi>General
Councils</hi> medled very little, knowing very
well that they could not be the same in all
places, and that every State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
knew best what ways and means
were most like to contribute to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
end, the <hi>reverence for Religion;</hi> and
sure there cannot be too intent a care in
Kings and Princes to preserve and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all decent Forms and Ceremonies both
in Church and State, which keeps up the
veneration and reverence due to Religion
and the Church of Christ, and the duty
and dignity due to Government, and to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48703:74"/>
the Majesty of Kings in an age when the
dissoluteness of manners, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness
and pride of the people too much
inclines them to a contempt of Religion,
to a neglect of order, and to an underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
and contending with the most <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Secular power cannot provide for
Ecclesiastical Reformations, because Kings
and Princes are not qualified to perform the
offices and functions of Religion, because they
do not pretend to consecrate Bishops, to ordain
Priests, or to administer the Sacraments,</hi> is
an argument to exclude them, as well from
the temporal as spiritual jurisdiction in the
determination of matters of right between
private men, in the punishment of the most
enormous crimes and offences. Justice
must be administred according to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
rules of the <hi>Law,</hi> and not the will
and inclination of the <hi>Iudge;</hi> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be presumed that Kings can be so well
versed in the Laws and customs which
must regulate the proceedings of Justice,
and therefore may be excluded from the
authority and power of judging the people;
and they are wonderful careful that you
may not believe that they would bereave
them of that inherent power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48703:75"/>
which they confess is committed to
them alone; but why the <hi>one</hi> and not the
<hi>other,</hi> since they can as well provide <hi>for
the one</hi> as <hi>for the other,</hi> is not so easie to be
comprehended by any rules of right reason.
Kings provide for the good administration
of <hi>justice,</hi> by making learned men <hi>Iudges,</hi>
whose province it is to execute the Law in
all cases; and they provide for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
and preservation of <hi>Religion,</hi>
by making pious and learned men <hi>Bishops,</hi>
and use their advice and assistance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
relating to the <hi>Church,</hi> as he doth that
of the Judges in cases pertaining to the
<hi>Law;</hi> and as he doth other <hi>Counsellors</hi> in
such things as have an immediate depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon the <hi>Wisdom of State;</hi> and both
<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> are bound to render an
account of their actions to <hi>Kings,</hi> who
have intrusted them; and if they have
been corrupt in the discharge of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Offices, they are equally liable to the
Kings displeasure, and to such punishments
as the Laws have provided for such enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which are inflicted upon them by
the <hi>Kings authority.</hi> And as no <hi>foreign
power</hi> can be so competent as the King's to
administer this Justice, since it must either
controul it, or be controuled by it; so it
is no easie matter for the <hi>Pope</hi> to prove
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48703:75"/>
himself a more <hi>spiritual Person</hi> than <hi>Kings</hi>
are, who have been in all Ages thought to
have somewhat of the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
by their very <hi>Office,</hi> whereas some
<hi>Popes</hi> have been pure <hi>Lay-men,</hi> when they
have been chosen to that Supreme office,
which is all the qualification they have to
be more <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> after; and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have been chosen <hi>Popes,</hi> who never
were <hi>Bishops,</hi> which is not a necessary
qualification for that dignity, every <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con-Cardinal</hi>
being as capable to be elected
<hi>Pope,</hi> as the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Bishop Cardinal;</hi>
and he that was a <hi>Bishop</hi> before consecrates
no <hi>Bishops</hi> himself after he is <hi>Pope,</hi> but that
function is performed by <hi>other Bishops</hi> by
vertue of his <hi>Commission</hi> or <hi>Bull;</hi> and the
same may as regularly be done by <hi>Bishops</hi>
by vertue of <hi>Kings Commissions</hi> in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Kingdoms, otherwise it would be
in the power of <hi>Popes</hi> to extinguish the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Bishops</hi> in any Princes Dominions;
and therefore the <hi>French Ambassador</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in his Masters name to <hi>Innocent the
Tenth,</hi> that if he persisted in the refusal to
make <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> upon that King's
nomination, they should chuse a <hi>Patriarch</hi>
of their own, who should supply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
But God be thanked that <hi>senseless
usurpation</hi> and <hi>exemption</hi> of the <hi>Clergie</hi> from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48703:76"/>
the common justice of Nations, is pretty
well out of countenance; and since the
<hi>Republick of Venice</hi> so notoriously baffled
<hi>Paul the Fifth</hi> upon that very point, <hi>other
Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> have chastised their <hi>own
Clergie</hi> for <hi>transcendent crimes,</hi> without
asking leave of his <hi>Holiness,</hi> or treating
them in any other manner than they do
their <hi>ordinary Malefactors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the unity proposed and professed by
us in the Creed, <hi>I believe one holy Catholick
and Apostolick Church,</hi> if it be well considered
in what time <hi>that Creed</hi> was made, which
is not yet defined or determined by any
Church; and if it had been made by the
<hi>Apostles themselves,</hi> according to the fancy
of some men, that every one of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
should contribute his Article, it would
then be <hi>Canonical Scripture,</hi> which it is
not pretended to be; yet I think it is
agreed by most learned men, that it was
framed in the infancy of Christianity, and
in, or very soon after the time of the
Apostles themselves, and then it can have
no other signification than <hi>Credo Sanctam
Apostolicam Ecclesiam esse Catholicam,</hi> which
was a necessary Article at that time, when
the believing that the Church was to be
<hi>universal,</hi> and to consist equally of <hi>Gentiles</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48703:76"/>
as well as <hi>Iews,</hi> was one of the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
points of Christianity, and most oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and for the Confirmation whereof
the Apostles took most pains after they
were all reconciled to it themselves; and
as it could have no other sence <hi>then,</hi> so the
restraining it to any one Church <hi>now,</hi> or
to make it serve for a distinction between
Churches and Nations, and to produce a
separation between them, must be very
unnatural if any sence at all. To conclude
then this <hi>discourse of unity,</hi> I know not how
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> can refuse to submit to that good
rule and determination that S. <hi>Gregory</hi>
long since gave upon the third Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
administred to him by <hi>Austin the Monk,
Cum una sit fides, cur sunt Ecclesiarum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versae
consuetudines, &amp; altera consuetudo
Missarum in sancta Romana Ecclesia, atque
altera in Galliarum tenetur? Respondet
Gregorius Papa, Novit fraternitas tua Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae
Ecclesiae consuetudinem, in qua se nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritam
meminit, sed mihi placet, ut sive in
Romana, five in Galliarum, seu in qualibet
Ecclesia, aliquid invenisti quod plus omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti
Deo posset placere, sollicitè eligas, &amp;
in Anglorum Ecclesia, quae adhuc ad fidem
nova est, institutione praecipuâ, quae de mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
Ecclesiis colligere potuisti, infundas, non
enim pro locis res, sed pro bonis rebus loca
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48703:77"/>
amanda sunt. Ex singulis ergo quibusque
Ecclesiis, quae pia, quae religiosa, quae recta
sunt elige, &amp; haec quasi in fasciculum collect a
apud Anglorum mentes in consuetudinem depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi>
If <hi>Austin</hi> had conformed himself
to these Instructions, it is very probable
that he might have had as good success in
reconciling the <hi>Eritish Church,</hi> who prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
insisted against any deference to the
<hi>Roman,</hi> not comprehending any possible
reason for such a superiority; or if the
successors of <hi>Gregory</hi> had been of his temper
and Christian prudence, <hi>Christendom</hi> had
been much <hi>better united</hi> at this day, or
more <hi>innocently separated,</hi> and unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
reasons for the reformation of some
errors which had unwarily creeped in, or
removing some scandals, which could not
otherwise be kept out, would not have
been so often rejected, upon no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
than that the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> was not of
that opinion, nor would whole <hi>National
Churches,</hi> because they have with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Soveraign power removed some
error which the other chuses to retain, be
reviled with the names of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and
<hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and the <hi>universal</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
within the <hi>Province of Rome,</hi> and
not be allowed to be members of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> because they will not be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48703:77"/>
subject to that of the <hi>Roman,</hi> which would
usurp the authority of condemning many
more Christians than are contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the community thereof. To make any
<hi>profession of a willingness to submit mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the sence of Scripture to a lawful
General Council,</hi> (besides that I do not
know that there is any difference upon
any Text of Scripture that concerns Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
I confess I take it to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
and in that respect not very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
since it is manifestly impossible
for any such Council ever to meet, whilst
that of <hi>Rome</hi> challenges the sole power of
calling it, and pretends to such a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
in it, that nothing must be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by it, but what is proposed by the <hi>Pope</hi>
or his <hi>Legats,</hi> and all <hi>Kingdoms</hi> or <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
as well as <hi>private persons,</hi> who will not
submit to his Soveraignty, shall be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from thence under the notion of being
<hi>Hereticks;</hi> so that all <hi>Protestants</hi> must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
as <hi>Delinquents</hi> to be censured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
which would be a strange condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to submit to, when no body can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
them to appear but their own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns:
Nor can it be called a <hi>free Council,</hi>
where all who ought to be looked upon as
members of it, are not equally free.
When <hi>General Councils</hi> were first called,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48703:78"/>
all the Christians of the world were one
mans subjects, who could both compel as
many of them as he thought necessary to
be present, and to obey and submit to
whatsoever was determined; whereas
now there being so many <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
who have much larger Dominions than
the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and are equally Soveraigns
in those their Dominions, and none of
their subjects can appear there without
their Soveraigns consent: And lastly, it
being a <hi>Catholick Tenent,</hi> that how nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
soever the convention in Council is,
and how universal soever the consent is in
what is determined, the <hi>Canons</hi> made
there are not obligatory to any Kingdom
before it be received and submitted to in
that Kingdom, upon which the <hi>Council of
Trent</hi> is not yet received in <hi>France,</hi> and in
many other <hi>Catholick Countries;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will be very hard for Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> to
justifie the defending or urging the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>that Council</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> where it
was never <hi>received,</hi> and hath been always
<hi>rejected:</hi> And for these reasons it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
be thought <hi>morally impossible</hi> for any
<hi>general free Council</hi> ever to meet, which
must grow every day more impossible as
the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> is farther spread, and
when the whole world is converted, as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48703:78"/>
we do not only pray it may, but believe it
will be; it will be very hard for the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Geographer</hi> to assign a place for the
meeting, where the Bishops from all parts
may reasonably hope to live to be present
there, and to return from thence with the
resolutions of the Councils into his <hi>own
Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>means of unity,</hi>
which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> says were left by our
Lord to his Church, for the preservation
of unity, (besides that most of those
means are as applicable to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> as to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
though none of them in the terms he uses
appear to be enjoyned or left by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our)
let him but prove the <hi>Ninth</hi> and
<hi>Tenth, That the ordinary authority is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the Supreme Pastor, the Bishop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>and that his jurisdiction extends it
self to the whole Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in case any
Heresies arise, or that any Controversies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be any otherwise ended, he hath authority
to determine the points of Catholick truth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</hi>
&amp;c. I say let him prove this, and
he hath no need of any of the other means;
and I will give him farther this advantage
over me, that if he can prove that I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to conform my judgment in any thing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48703:79"/>
to the <hi>determination</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> more than
to the <hi>determination</hi> of the <hi>Bishop of S. Iago,</hi>
I will go to <hi>Mass</hi> with him to <hi>morrow;</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> himself might be a <hi>good Catholick</hi>
if he had not unwarrantably (to say no
worse of it) subscribed to the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius
the Fourth,</hi> which is no obligation by the
Council, when he submitted to his <hi>new
Ordination,</hi> though he were of the same
opinion. And if that <hi>Tenth proposition</hi> of
his be the doctrine of the Catholick
Church, the <hi>Colledge of Sorbon</hi> hath been
often to blame in not consenting to it; and
I know not how the <hi>Iansenists</hi> in <hi>France</hi>
can be excused for paying not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to the judgment and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>two Popes</hi> upon the <hi>five Propositions;</hi>
for <hi>Alexander the Seventh</hi> confirmed what
<hi>Innocent the Tenth</hi> had first defined, nor
was the silence that is since submitted to
in those particulars, an effect of the <hi>Popes
authority,</hi> but of the <hi>Kings,</hi> which
amounts to little less than a <hi>revocation,</hi> at
least a <hi>suspension</hi> of the <hi>Popes Decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument that the Doctor uses
from the <hi>Tragical miscarriages</hi> of <hi>Popes</hi> is
very apposite and convincing to those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men to believe do establish his <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48703:79"/>
Supremacy.</hi> He says that <hi>our Saviour
hath committed a Supreme jurisdiction to the
person of the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>over the whole
Church, that in case any Heresies arise, or
any Controversies,</hi> in causis majoribus, <hi>to
determine the points of Catholick truth,</hi> &amp;c.
To which there can be nothing more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
answered for confutation, than
that the State of the Church must have
been very deplorable and desperate, if that
had been a Catholick verity, when <hi>Pope
Marcellinus</hi> sacrificed to Idols, or when
<hi>Pope Liberius</hi> turned <hi>Arrian,</hi> and would
be much more lamentable in these days,
when the Church must remain in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<hi>wardship</hi> and <hi>servitude</hi> under the <hi>Pope,</hi>
since no man can rationally expect a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council</hi> to relieve her; and when there
is no other definition of <hi>Heresie</hi> in the <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Domini,</hi> than that which contradicts,
or is contrary to the doctrine or practice of
the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and when the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Pope</hi> is urged as the best expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for the establishing peace and unity
in the world; can there be any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
more pertinently for the conviction,
than the mention of <hi>those Popes,</hi> who by
the assuming that authority, and purely
for the vindication of it, have caused more
<hi>Christian blood</hi> to have been spilt, more
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48703:80"/>
               <hi>horrible Massacres</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>People,</hi> than all the <hi>Heresies</hi> in the world,
and all other <hi>politick differences</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
if you cast in the Wars for the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Land,</hi> which may justly be cast upon
the Popes account, and (which is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
very infamous as well as lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table)
much the greatest part of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and ruine proceeded from the
<hi>perjury</hi> of <hi>Popes themselves,</hi> after they had
promised and sworn to observe such pacts
and agreements voluntarily entred into by
themselves, or from the Dispensations
they granted to others to break their Faith,
and not to perform the contracts they had
entred into; <hi>all which,</hi> he says, <hi>being
granted, nothing will follow;</hi> whereas cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it must follow, that the persons of
such men are not capable or worthy of such
trusts or authority, which is as much as
those arguments are urged for. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
would be contented to confess that <hi>some
Popes for about an Age or two did cause into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
disorders in the Church and Empire,</hi>
(which by the way is argument enough
against those personal qualifications) <hi>upon
condition that we would gratifie him with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that the Government of Popes
did for a thousand years produce excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the world;</hi> which we are so far from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48703:80"/>
granting, that as we must confess that they
were so modest for half that time, as to
make no claim to any such authority in
Church or State; so from the time they
did claim it, it produced more blood-shed
than all other quarrels whatsoever. And
as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> must have the assistance of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good <hi>Antiquaries</hi> to name one War of a
years continuance, that was ever <hi>composed</hi>
by the <hi>authority</hi> or <hi>mediation</hi> of <hi>any Pope,</hi>
where there can very hardly be named one
solemn bloody War upon what Politick
pretence soever it was at first entred into,
but that hath been carried on either upon
his <hi>immediate advice</hi> and <hi>interest,</hi> or <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi>
under-hand by <hi>his Council</hi> and <hi>assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
of which the <hi>Rebellion in Ireland</hi> must
be one of the latest instances. It cannot be
denied that some Ages have been so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and barbarous, that the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
hath been sufficient to kindle the most
cruel and the most unnatural bloody diffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and he hath never failed in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
his utmost power to that end; and
it can be as easily proved, that in this last
Age many rebellions and ravenous Wars
have fallen out, which might either have
been prevented or quickly composed, as
the late <hi>Rebellions in France,</hi> and those in
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> being both between <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:48703:81"/>
if he as a <hi>common Father</hi> would have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his <hi>special authority,</hi> and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
those who he could not doubt were
<hi>in Rebellion;</hi> but he never would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to apply his power to that good
end. The <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of
the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> was never the product
of <hi>peace;</hi> it grew very fat, and the bulk
thereof encreased to that unruly size in and
by the most <hi>bloody Wars</hi> which <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
hath ever been infested with, which
makes it discernable enough what diet
they chuse to feed upon; of which appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
their late <hi>savage Bulls</hi> against the <hi>peace
of Munster,</hi> and that of <hi>Osningbrooke,</hi>
when the <hi>Empire</hi> was even at its last gasp
for want of blood, is too great a manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Nor have they to this day, how
little noise soever they now make, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
any of those principles, or the
pretence to any of that power, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
whereof so many intolerable disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> confesses, were caused
for about an Age or two in the Church,
and in the Empire.</p>
            <p>I wonder Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> should accuse the
Doctor <hi>for arguing less reasonably in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the Schismes which have been in
the Church of Rome, and the more modern
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48703:81"/>
disorders, by reason of the quarrels between
Bishops and Monastick Orders about exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
and priviledges, &amp;c.</hi> But I wonder
more at his unskilfulness in the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
History,</hi> when he says, <hi>that all the
Schismes were after the Church was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twelve hundred years old, for before
there were scarce any;</hi> which is so great
a mistake, that my old kindness will
scarce suffer me to take notice of it;
The <hi>last Schisme</hi> (as I think) before the
year <hi>twelve hundred</hi> was that between
<hi>Alexander the third,</hi> and <hi>Victor the fifth,</hi>
which was after the year <hi>eleven hundred
and fifty,</hi> and is reckoned by all <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Writers</hi> to be the <hi>twenty fourth,</hi> or
<hi>twenty fifth Schisme,</hi> and it is an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
objection, that there can be no
such power inherent in the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he
assigns to him, when it is so frequently
uncertain who is <hi>Pope,</hi> and that uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
hath continued so long, and all the
<hi>Princes of Christendom</hi> divided in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of him, and the <hi>anti-Pope,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
three or four together, act, and do all
that the true <hi>Pope</hi> pretends to do, and is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
as such in the <hi>Dominions</hi> of several
<hi>Christian Princes;</hi> This sure cannot be
thought a light argument, by any but such
who think the pretence too frivolous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48703:82"/>
an argument against it; and he says
<hi>the mention of the quarrels between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and Monastick Orders, and between
the Regulars, and the Seculars, and much
more such stuff, implies no more, but that
Subjects are often times Rebellious to their
Superiours, therefore it were better there
were no Superiours at all; when such stuff
is an unanswerable argument, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with the which he would invest
the Pope for peace, and unity sake, doth
not produce either, where it is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to;</hi> He says very true, that it is
not the <hi>Popes infallibility,</hi> but his <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
which ends Controversies, which
is a good argument that they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unended, when either party doth
not acknowledge his authority; and it
seems the case is not very different, when
both sides do confess it, for he says that
<hi>all Catholicks do acknowledge that they are
obliged at least to silence when imposed by
the Pope,</hi> yet it cannot be denied, but
that some have not complied with the
obligation; but that he says is <hi>not to be
imputed to want of authority in the Pope,
but to the unruliness of mens passions and
pride,</hi> and I say it serves the Doctor's turn,
if his authority be not such as can curb,
and suppress the unruliness of the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48703:82"/>
and pride of his own Subjects. He
will not understand how the Doctor can
say, <hi>that the Church of England makes no
Articles of Faith, but such as have testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and approbation of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World of all Ages, and are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be such by Rome it self, and in
other things she requires subscription to them,
not as Articles of Faith, but as inferiour
truths, which she expects submission to, in
order to her peace and tranquillity.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Cressy</hi> is the only man alive that can
find obscurity in this clause, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
his exception to it is so obscure, that
I will rather rely upon the Readers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the most exact plainness of it,
than inlarge my self in any explanation,
and I wish that he could say as much for
the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that it makes no
<hi>Article of Faith,</hi> but such as have the
testimony and approbation of the whole
Christian World of all Ages; our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
is, that he multiplies articles of faith
to that degree, that he will not suffer us to
be saved for believing all that most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
believed for a thousand years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without the least doubt of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
nor will he yet let us know the full
extent he would have our faith reach to,
for we are no less obliged to submit to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48703:83"/>
what <hi>he</hi> or his <hi>Successors</hi> shall declare
hereafter to be <hi>matter of faith,</hi> than to
what is at present contained in the whole
<hi>Canons of the Council of Trent,</hi> which
makes it absolutely necessary for the <hi>peace
of Conscience,</hi> as well as the <hi>peace of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>
to protest against, and as far as in
us lies to <hi>restrain</hi> that <hi>exorbitant autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
but of all arguments it is a most
pleasant one, <hi>that if the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
believes nothing as of faith, but what
the Popes, and Church of Rome do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
believe; Therefore it follows that the
Church of Rome, notwithstanding its Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
Fanaticisme, &amp;c. failes in no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
point of faith;</hi> which would be
true, if it <hi>added nothing</hi> to that <hi>confessed
faith</hi> that must <hi>destroy it.</hi> He then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
himself in his <hi>old circle</hi> of the
<hi>Churches authority,</hi> and of that Churches
being the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
of that authority being in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which whosoever refuses
to submit to, must be an <hi>Heretick;</hi> to all
which enough hath been said before, nor
can I enlarge upon it, without saying
somewhat that I have said before, which
I have no mind to do.</p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>Seventh,</hi> and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48703:83"/>
               <hi>Eighth Chapters</hi> concerning <hi>Penance,</hi> &amp;c.
upon which I shall enlarge the less, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Church of England</hi> is so far from
condemning <hi>Confession</hi> or <hi>Penance,</hi> that it
uses, and commends both, and upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
always <hi>satisfaction</hi> is enjoyned <hi>there,</hi>
as much as in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> it is
true that with us it is not so <hi>positively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,</hi>
that is, men are not <hi>compelled to it;</hi>
nor are <hi>those forms</hi> used in ours, or <hi>those
interrogatories</hi> administred, by which those
<hi>secrets are extorted</hi> from Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which they would willingly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,</hi>
and which may lawfully be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
as in <hi>their Church,</hi> but <hi>Penitents</hi>
are lest to their <hi>own liberty,</hi> and their
<hi>own method</hi> of drawing such information
and comfort from their Confessors, as
they believe most useful to them, which
was the original end of <hi>Confession,</hi> and from
which very many <hi>good Catholicks</hi> believe
there is at present too great a deviation.
God forbid the integrity and piety of any
Church should be suspected, much less
condemned for the evil livers who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
within the pale of it. No Church
hath ever yet, nor any will ever be but
the triumphant, without abundance of
them; yet it being the <hi>principal end,</hi>
and the most <hi>manifest perfection</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48703:84"/>
to introduce an <hi>innocence of life,</hi>
and a <hi>sincerity of manners</hi> into all those
who profess it, all Churches cannot too
severely affect that Discipline which hath
the greatest operation upon the lives, and
actions of their Children; whether there
are not some corruptions creeped into the
common practice of <hi>auricular Confession,</hi>
whether the <hi>ordinary customary Confessors</hi>
are not <hi>too remiss,</hi> or <hi>over curious</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining,
and consequently in informing
their <hi>Penitents,</hi> or <hi>too easie,</hi> and <hi>perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi>
in their <hi>absolutions,</hi> will not become
me to determine, but Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> well
knows that very many learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Catholicks</hi> do publickly lament the
scandalous corruptions which have been
practised, and countenanced in that vital
part of their Religion. Who those <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
from the Catholick Church are, who
have left their Monasteries out of carnal
liberty, and carnal lusts,</hi> I am not at all
informed, but if they are so carnally
minded, I doubt some of them may be
instructed by him to ask him, how he
<hi>forgot what he had formerly believed,</hi> and
whether he was <hi>in a moment inspired to
answer to a new Catechisme full of new
Articles of Faith?</hi> If conscience hath had
no influence upon them, they have been
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48703:84"/>
very weak, and not <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be tempted by the <hi>Woman,</hi>
since they might have had the full use
of her with much more good husbandry,
and less guilt, without leaving their <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries;</hi>
for it is a ruled and a vowed case by
most, if not all their <hi>Casuists,</hi> that <hi>fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is a less sin than <hi>marriage,</hi> and the
reason they give is, that the last is living
in <hi>perpetual adultery.</hi> Whoever hath lived
in those places which are most inhabited
by <hi>Religious Men,</hi> is very little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
with the <hi>Catholick same,</hi> if he doth
believe the major part of <hi>Religious Men</hi>
to be enough mortified against that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
though no doubt very many of
them have subdued the temptation, and
it will not only be <hi>charity,</hi> but <hi>common
justice</hi> to think that those <hi>Apostates</hi> over
whom Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> so much infults, have
been governed by their Conscience, since
it was hardly possible they could be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Woman,</hi> having enough of that
Sex at their devotion, without the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and impediment of marriage; and till
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> informs us why <hi>Monasteries</hi> are
better <hi>Schools of Holiness</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi>
than <hi>our Colledges</hi> are, whose Discipline
is as severe, admitting cleanliness be to be
preferred before slovenlines, and doctrine
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48703:85"/>
much stricter, enough hath been already
said for their vindication, and need not
be repeated.</p>
            <p>I think I understand the excuse that
<hi>Mr. Cressy</hi> makes for the notorious trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
which have been in the matter
of <hi>confession,</hi> and <hi>absolution,</hi> in reference
to which he says the Doctor is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that <hi>not very long since, among
several dangerous positions collected out of
some modern Casuists, such scandalous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations
in administring the Sacrament
of Penance had a principal place, all
which were not only condemned by the
Bishops of France, almost in every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
but also a Book, the Author of
which undertook to defend them, was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
prohibited, and condemned by the
Pope, since which time</hi> he says <hi>such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
have been wholly restrained, and
silenced;</hi> to which I shall only say, that
these <hi>modern Casuists</hi> continue still the
<hi>greatest Confessors</hi> in all <hi>Catholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
and it is observable that not one
amongst them, hath ever yet renounced,
or disclaimed one of those dangerous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
or positions which stand so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and it can therefore hardly be
known that such doctrines are wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48703:85"/>
and for their being <hi>silenced,</hi> which
they urge still as a matter of <hi>great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
in those loud differences, and as if
all the passions, and inconveniencies which
arise from thence were thereby suppressed,
if not extinguished, whoever hath any
conversation with those adversaries may
quickly discern, that neither of them
hath laid aside their propositions, or the
animosities against each other, and the
silence contributes so little of charity
that <hi>poor Monsieur</hi>—since he was
known to be the Author of the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Letters,</hi> can scarce enjoy peace in his
Grave; Indeed if the <hi>Bishops of France</hi>
were not over-powred, and even silenced
too, by the <hi>Regular Clergy,</hi> those excesses
would in a short time be well reformed;
The danger is, that in the method and form
of customary confessions, there remains still
a contention between the <hi>Authority of the
Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>of the Church,</hi> without
which it could hardly fall out, that so
many men, who all hours of the day and
of the night indulge to themselves, even
without concealing it, the practice of those
sins which the Scripture hath prohibited
under the <hi>penalty of damnation,</hi> cannot be
seduced by example, or importunity, hardly
by sickness, to eat flesh upon a day of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48703:86"/>
nor from prophane or unclean dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in that very time, which can proceed
from no other principle, than that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
the <hi>injunctions of the Church,</hi>
(which without doubt ought to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
is a <hi>greater sin,</hi> than those of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
and men would not run to <hi>confession</hi>
as they wash their hands, with a resolution
to make them less clean as soon as they
have done. If those fountains of <hi>confession</hi>
and <hi>absolution,</hi> from whence so many draw
the waters of life, come to be poysoned or
prophaned, they were much better be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up for a time, or carefully inclosed
that men might not resort thither, till
they are better instructed in the use of
them; and we may without breach of
charity believe that very odious corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and presumptions had broken into
those sacred offices, when the Church it
self took so much notice of it, and could
not prescribe a more secret remedy than a
<hi>publick Bull,</hi> which <hi>Pope Pius the fourth</hi>
thought necessary to publish, <hi>Contra sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes,
qui mulieres poenitentes in actu Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessionis
ad actus inhonestos provocare, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licere
tentant, Bul. To. 2.</hi> Nor can we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that this remedy wrought its effect,
when <hi>another Pope</hi> near one hundred
years after was compelled to renew and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48703:86"/>
inlarge that <hi>Bull</hi> with greater penalties, as
<hi>Pope Gregory the fifteenth</hi> hath done, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
sacerdotes in confessionibus Sacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus
poenitentes sollicitantes, Bul. To.</hi> 3.
In which it is observable, that a greater
latitude is permitted to <hi>Confessors</hi> for the
discovery of this <hi>horrible impiety,</hi> than is
allowed for the discovery and prevention
of the <hi>foulest Treason;</hi> and after all this,
the condemning the dangerous positions
of the <hi>modern Casuists</hi> hath been found as
necessary, which is still an argument that
somewhat was still amiss in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of those Offices.</p>
            <p>That great reverence was paid to the
memory of many excellent persons after
their death, by visiting their Tombs, and
other commemoration of their vertues,
and noble actions, hath great testimony
from antiquity, as ancient as we have any
evidence of the practice of any formal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
amongst Christians: As the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians</hi> amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> did not
decline going to the Synagogues, nor the
practice of all things which were in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
with that Nation, when the same
could be innocently performed; so
amongst the <hi>Gentiles</hi> they observed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was in great reverence amongst
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48703:87"/>
them, as the paying respect to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their Ancestors always was, and that
did not contradict or offend any Christian
Precept; and it is not improbable that
they might take that practice from them,
since the <hi>visitation of the Tombs</hi> and <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Martyrs</hi> is as ancient as <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
it self:</hi> but that those forms of <hi>Prayer
for the dead,</hi> which are now practised in
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> were in use amongst
Christians <hi>from the beginning till Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantism
arose,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will not prove;
and there is too great reason to doubt,
that whosoever doth believe, that enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
sins which are unacknowledged and
unrepented of at the death of the sinner
may be expiated, and consequently must
be pardoned by what they who live after
him can do for him, hath a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to live without that strict guard upon
his affections, and his passions, which he
might otherwise believe to be necessary.
But I do not think that any but <hi>illiterate
Catholicks</hi> have that opinion, whether the
most learned amongst them are not well
content, that the rest in this, and many
other particulars should believe what they
themselves do not believe, I refer to
Mr. <hi>Cressy;</hi> assuring him likewise, that if
I did think that my Prayers, or any thing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48703:87"/>
else I could do, could purchase the least ease
to the Souls of my Friends, or of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I would your them out with all may
heart, and should not fear any reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which hath
declared no judgment in the point, except
it be comprehended in the <hi>Article of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
and then the censure is no more,
than that it is a <hi>fond thing,</hi> which in that
case I would be content to undergo; and
for the many <hi>Masses</hi> which are usually said
for them, and which seems to give <hi>rich
sinners</hi> some advantage, I will say no
more, than that to my understanding that
<hi>Priest</hi> who believes his <hi>Mass</hi> gives any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the <hi>departed Soul,</hi> hath much to
answer that he doth not say it <hi>for charity,</hi>
but takes <hi>ten pence</hi> or a <hi>shilling</hi> (at the rate
that Masses are sold in that climate) which
seems to be more <hi>literal Simony</hi> than any
act that passes under that reproach.</p>
            <p>For the matter of <hi>Indulgences</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
seems to be intirely of the Doctors judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and opinion, and therefore I cannot
but wonder and lament, that it being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter the only Chapter in which
he hath treated him with civility, he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to conclude it so rudely, as to say that
<hi>every prudent Reader will easily discover from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48703:88"/>
how poysonous a heart it issues, and to how
unchristian an end it was directed.</hi> My ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
to <hi>Indulgences</hi> is, the <hi>deceit</hi> and
<hi>fraud</hi> that is in them, and the <hi>circumventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>common people,</hi> from which the
Church it self cannot be excused; there is
scarce a Village in all the <hi>Catholick Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the world, which hath not one day
in the year, if not more, the benefit of an
<hi>Indulgence,</hi> to obtain which they visit such
and such places and Churches so many
times, and in this expedition, people of
both sexes, the lame and the blind tire
themselves, when whoever can read <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
finds, that if he complies with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and Injunctions, which are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of every <hi>Indulgence</hi> of <hi>hearty repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
of all their sins, and a <hi>sincere amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life,</hi> and the like, he shall be sure
to enjoy all the benefits, and more than are
promised by that <hi>Indulgence,</hi> though he
should <hi>lie in his bed,</hi> whilst others make
those <hi>perambulations;</hi> and yet this kind of
fatuity is the ground of all those <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and of the <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
except for <hi>Penance,</hi> whereas
if the conditions be performed, they have
no need of the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and if they be
not, they have no benefit by it, though
it costs even the poorest people some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48703:88"/>
which they cannot well spare in most
places.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is not so sturdy a maintainer
of all the points in difference with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> but he would willingly part
with the <hi>Prayers in an unknown tongue,</hi>
though he says <hi>there is scarce a rustick so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
but well understands what the Priest
does, through the whole course of the Mass;</hi>
but I must confess my self so much more
ignorant than <hi>his Rustick,</hi> that though I
have seen many <hi>Masses,</hi> I never heard any,
nor saw any Congregation so intent, as if
they did desire to hear any thing that is
said, but <hi>whisper,</hi> and <hi>talk,</hi> and <hi>laugh,</hi>
except only at the <hi>Elevation;</hi> and if the
Congregation be great, especially at a
<hi>high Mass,</hi> it is hardly possible that any
considerable number of them can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
one word that is spoken; nor is it
held <hi>necessary,</hi> for as the Priest takes more
than ordinary care by an <hi>affected</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
pronunciation</hi> not to have what he
says understood, so the people generally
think themselves only concerned in being
present, and that it is not necessary for
them to hear or understand what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
because all that relates to them is
done, and completely performed by the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48703:89"/>
               <hi>Priest.</hi> He confesses that <hi>it was far from
being the Churches primary intention, that
the publick office should be in a tongue not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the people, for it was at first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</hi>
he says, <hi>in the language generally spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and understood through Europe;</hi> by
which I suppose he means the <hi>Latin tongue,</hi>
in which he is much mistaken, both that
<hi>Latin</hi> was generally spoken and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
through <hi>Europe;</hi> I am not sure that
it was the language of all <hi>Italy</hi> it self, or
that in the first composing of <hi>Liturgies,</hi>
they were all one and the same, or in <hi>one
Language.</hi> In the <hi>East,</hi> and throughout
the <hi>Greek Church</hi> we are sure they had,
and still have <hi>different Liturgies,</hi> and we
have no reason to believe, that in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Church</hi> the <hi>Liturgies</hi> were the same
throughout the <hi>West,</hi> but were such as the
<hi>Bishops</hi> allowed, or made for their own
<hi>Dioceses.</hi> We know that the <hi>British
Church</hi> retained its <hi>Liturgie</hi> for many
years; and that it was near, if not above
one thousand years (for it was not till the
time of <hi>Gregory the Seventh</hi>) before <hi>Spain</hi>
parted with the <hi>Gothish Liturgie,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
that from <hi>Rome;</hi> and how many
alterations have been since made in it, is
known to all who will inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and after all, I think S. <hi>Ambrose's
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48703:89"/>
Missal</hi> is still retained in <hi>Milan,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Clement the Eighth,</hi>
and of the <hi>succeeding Popes;</hi> and therefore
I cannot doubt but that and very many
particulars in common practioe, are parts
of that <hi>Religion of State,</hi> which may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breach of charity or unity, be altered
and reformed by the Soveraign in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as such mutations are made for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of <hi>Gods service</hi> in such a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Province for which it is made.
But Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> would find himself as much
deceived even in the making up that
breach, if the <hi>Popes</hi> consent be necessary
to it, as he was formerly in his draught
of a <hi>protestation</hi> or <hi>subscription</hi> for the fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>English Catholicks;</hi> yet we know
that <hi>Pope Pius</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Queen
Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, was very willing to
have dispensed with the usage of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Liturgie,</hi> the <hi>Communion in both kinds,</hi>
and whatever else was practised in <hi>that
Church,</hi> upon condition that the <hi>Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
and <hi>supremacy</hi> might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled
in <hi>that Kingdom,</hi> which he knew
would be a good bargain, and enable him
to undo all the rest when he should think it
necessary; but Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
more warily if he had before he left
the <hi>Church</hi> in which he was first ordained
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48703:90"/>
a <hi>Priest,</hi> procured a Reformation in those
two particulars, for which he is now so
willing to compound, <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>the
praying in an unknown tongue,</hi> which are
greater blemishes in the <hi>Church</hi> he hath
betaken himself into, than all he hath left
in that, which he is departed from.</p>
            <p>We are come at last to the Doctors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
against the <hi>Church of Romes</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>reading of the Bible</hi> indifferently;
and with this exception Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> makes
himself very merry, as if the principles of
the Religion of the <hi>Church of England must
fall to the ground,</hi> or, as he says, <hi>utterly go
to wrack</hi> if that liberty were denied; <hi>for
how then should every sober enquirer into
Scripture frame a Religion to himself?</hi> And
so pleases himself with endeavouring to
perswade others, contrary to his own
conscience, that every one of the <hi>Church of
England</hi> hath liberty to <hi>frame a Religion to
himself,</hi> whereas he well knows that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
member</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath as
much liberty to <hi>frame a Religion to himself,</hi>
as any one of the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath,
who is as much obliged to conform himself
to the doctrine of <hi>that Church,</hi> as the other
is to that of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for the opinion it
hath of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> it answers for it self in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48703:90"/>
these words; Article Sixth, <hi>Holy Scripture
containeth all things necessary for salvation,
so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor
may be proved thereby, is not to be required
of any man, that it should be believed as an
Article of the Faith, or be thought requisite
or necessary to Salvation:</hi> How will this
serve his turn to <hi>frame a Religion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</hi>
But then he recreates himself with a
Dialogue which he makes between <hi>the
Doctor</hi> and one of <hi>his Parishioners,</hi> which
if he pleases, is his own case, whilst he
triumphs in his conquests of those poor
people, which he perverts; what do
those simple creatures know of the <hi>authority
of the whole Church,</hi> when he amuzes
them with points of Controversie of <hi>good
works,</hi> and of <hi>Christs very flesh and blood in
the Sacrament,</hi> contrary to the very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of all his senses, to which all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
have been subjected; have those
people any other knowledge or informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the sense of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
than from him? and would it not better
become them to answer him, that in those
points they would chuse rather to believe
their <hi>own Minister,</hi> to whom the care of
their Souls is committed, than him who
is <hi>a stranger</hi> to them? or if they have heard
of him, they ought the less to believe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48703:91"/>
him. Whoever knows the Doctor and
Him, or hath carefully perused their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
cannot be blamed for preferring the
former before the latter. <hi>But then how can
these people who read the</hi> Scripture, <hi>and
appeal to it, know that they have the</hi>
true Scripture, <hi>which is the word of God?</hi>
which is a worn-out question, that hath
been as often answered as asked. The
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath no other evidence of
the truth of it, than <hi>we have,</hi> and the
<hi>Tradition</hi> that hath derived it, doth as
much belong to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as
to <hi>the other;</hi> there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us in any particular that relates to
<hi>Tradition,</hi> where the <hi>tradition</hi> is as <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi>
or as <hi>manifest</hi> as it is in that of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
The Doctor is so far from saying or
thinking that <hi>every Christian is to be a judge
of the sence of Scripture,</hi> that he doth not
believe that <hi>every Church</hi> is fit to be a <hi>judge
of it;</hi> nor doth it appear that the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> it self, which would be thought to
be <hi>Catholick,</hi> and <hi>instar omnium,</hi> doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to understand, much less to judge of
the sence of the <hi>whole Scripture;</hi> and yet a
very weak member of either may clearly
understand the sence of those particular
places, which are necessary to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
for his salvation; as no man is so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48703:91"/>
as not to know what the sence of
<hi>Adultery,</hi> and of <hi>Theft,</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> and
the like, which he is forbid to be guilty
of; and if he be so ignorant, he will not
be the more inclined to detest them by
reading the <hi>School-men;</hi> and if he be of the
<hi>Church of England</hi> he knows whither to
repair for advice and counsel in difficult
cases, and refuses not to submit to it. But
that no authority may be able to do us
good, he hath obtained a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
faculty to answer and avoid it, and
which is the nearest to smelling it out with
his Nose that I have been informed of.
The Doctor to prove that the Christians
in all times were indulged and exhorted to
<hi>read the Scriptures,</hi> besides many other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
backs his demonstrations, as
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> confesses, with an army of the
<hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> who are cited by him,
and their doctrine acknowledged by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
late <hi>Catholick Divines</hi> of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
account, and which he himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to be true; but he says notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that <hi>no Catholick, nor he thinks any
other man in his right wits will grant that
every Porter, Cobler, or Lawndress is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to instruct themselves by reading the
Scriptures alone, or to clear the doctrine of
the mystery of the Holy Trinity, the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48703:92"/>
of our Saviour, the Procession of the Holy
Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. In all which I do not know
that he hath an adversary. After he hath
asked the Doctor a question or two of his
own judgment, concerning the <hi>Fathers</hi>
concessions in those cases, whether they
did not suppose that they to whom they
gave this license, would <hi>for the sence of
difficult points have submitted their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Church.</hi> But then he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to know, that if there had been such
an <hi>Architect of principles,</hi> as the
Doctor, in the time of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
they would not have been so zealous
in their exhortations to a promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
reading of <hi>Scriptures.</hi> For he says,
and hopes you will take his word for it,
that the Doctors <hi>principles do evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the most pernicious Soul-destroying Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
that ever assaulted Gods Church; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which banish peace, charity, humility
and obedience utterly from the Church and
State;</hi> which if true, as they could never
have entred into the Doctors thoughts by
reading the Scriptures, so there can be no
such antidote to expel those poysons, as by
the Scriptures; for I will undertake to
shew very plain places in Scripture, of the
sence whereof there is no doubt made, for
the confutation of all <hi>those principles;</hi> and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48703:92"/>
if he be of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> mind, that
more <hi>Syllogisms</hi> can be made for truth
than against it, he will not think the worse
of <hi>reading the Scriptures</hi> for <hi>those principles;</hi>
yet he concludes, that if <hi>the Fathers</hi> had
foreseen these mischiefs, they would never
have given such advice; yet he does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that <hi>the four first general Councils</hi> never
put any such restraint upon the <hi>reading the
Scriptures;</hi> for which he gives as good a
reason as his answer concerning the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
because of the difference between
the <hi>Heresies of those times,</hi> and the <hi>Heresies
of these times. The Inventors of the ancient
Heresies,</hi> he says, <hi>were great learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and subtle Philosophers, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their Heresies were sublime mysteries
of Faith, examined and framed by them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the grounds of</hi> Plato'<hi>s and</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle's
<hi>Philosophy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hence,</hi> he says,
<hi>it come to pass that in those days the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
might be read freely enough by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christians without danger, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
their intention of reading them was
not to find out a new Religion, but to instruct
themselves in piety, and to inflame their
hearts in the Divine love:</hi> pag. 161, 162.
<hi>But our modern Heresies</hi> (he says) <hi>are of a
quite different complexion, they are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
about matters obvious to the weakest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48703:93"/>
as the external administration of
Sacraments, the jurisdiction of Superiors
Civil and Ecclesiastical, the manner of mens
devotions, the institution of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the obligation of Vows, the Ordinances
of the Church touching Fasting, Matrimony,
Celibacy, paying of Tithes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Or if about
sublime mysteries men are taught to examine
such mysteries by natural reason, and the
verdict of their outwardsenses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>sence</hi> of all this,
that towards the conviction of the highest
and the greatest <hi>Heresies</hi> which ever were
in the Church, and which were only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the name of <hi>Heresies,</hi> and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denned
as such by the pure and strong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
might be permitted, at least might
be read without danger; especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the intention of reading them then
was, that men might be the better for it:
But that now in these <hi>modern Heresies,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and the <hi>institution of
Religious Orders</hi> and <hi>Vows,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures</hi> are <hi>pernicious,</hi> and serves
only to find out a <hi>new Religion?</hi> I can in
truth collect no other sence than this from
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s distinction between the <hi>ancient</hi>
and <hi>modern Heresies;</hi> or for his conclusion,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48703:93"/>
that those <hi>godly Fathers</hi> who are cited by
the Doctor, and truly cited, as he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
had lived amongst us, or if such <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
had been then spread amongst their
Disciples, they would not have been so
zealous in their exhortations to a promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
reading of Scripture. I think they
would, because I am sure they would
have had the same reason, and would have
wondered how any differences of opinion
upon the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical jurisdiction,</hi>
upon the <hi>manner of mens devotions,</hi> or upon
the <hi>institution of Religious orders,</hi> or the
rest, come to be called <hi>Heresies?</hi> And who
had authority to declare them such? If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that hath reference to any of these
particulars was in practice in their time,
we have the less reason to acquiesce in the
new invention of them; and it will be the
more worth our enquiry, whether they
who have put that brand upon them, were
not rather <hi>parties</hi> than <hi>judges</hi> and <hi>gainers</hi>
by their <hi>determinations.</hi> If those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
can neither be confirmed by <hi>Scripture,</hi>
nor defended by <hi>reason,</hi> we need not be
troubled for their being called <hi>Heresies,</hi>
though there were no <hi>Scripture</hi> against
them, nor <hi>reason</hi> to confute them; both
which we conceive we have clearly on our
sides; let us examine them in order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48703:94"/>
Concerning the <hi>external administration of
Sacraments,</hi> we take upon us to say, that
they rob the people of <hi>half</hi> that which <hi>our
Saviour instituted,</hi> and that (besides the
<hi>novelty of it,</hi> for we say it was near, if not
full <hi>one thousand years</hi> before that violence
was offered to <hi>Christianity)</hi> they may as
well defraud them of <hi>both,</hi> as of <hi>either</hi> of
the <hi>species,</hi> and the answer they give to it,
can give no reasonable satisfaction to any;
for to that allegation that the <hi>body</hi> cannot be
without <hi>the blood,</hi> and consequently <hi>the
bread</hi> contains <hi>both,</hi> if our Saviour had
thought so, he would have instituted it in
that manner; the whole obligations of
mystery depending only upon the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then our Saviour well knew that in
the sence they put upon it, it would have
been an institution directly <hi>contrary to the
Law,</hi> which our Saviour never violated,
for the eating the <hi>flesh</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> was
<hi>utterly unlawful,</hi> and what was unlawful
in the institution, cannot become lawful
since, by any authority under Heaven;
and therefore they who cannot be suffered
to receive it in <hi>both species,</hi> are without the
<hi>benefit of the Sacrament</hi> that was instituted
by our Saviour, and that is all I shall say of
the <hi>external administration.</hi> For the <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the mysteries</hi> by <hi>natural reason,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48703:94"/>
and the verdict of their <hi>outward senses;</hi> I
shall only ask whether those <hi>outward senses</hi>
are <hi>proper judges,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> is <hi>bread,</hi> and
<hi>that</hi> is <hi>wine,</hi> by their <hi>sight,</hi> and their <hi>taste,</hi>
and their <hi>feeling</hi> it, before the <hi>consecration,</hi>
which no body will deny. How different
the operation thereof may be after that
<hi>mysterious action,</hi> and the <hi>spiritual effect</hi> of
it, no man pretends to make a judgement
by his <hi>outward senses,</hi> but if he be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to taste both after the consecration,
why his senses should not be as competent
discerners whether they remain still <hi>bread</hi>
and <hi>wine</hi> as <hi>they were,</hi> or are become <hi>flesh</hi>
and <hi>blood,</hi> which they <hi>were not before,</hi> I
cannot comprehend; no more than why
we should be bound to understand those
few words <hi>literally,</hi> which are so evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradicted by our senses, which no
other miracle ever was, rather than many
other <hi>metaphorical</hi> and <hi>allegorical expressions</hi>
in which the Scriptures abound, and
which cannot be more controuled by the
outward senses than this is. For the <hi>juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
of <hi>Superiors Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi>
what Judge can there be, but the Laws of
that Kingdom where such jurisdiction is to
be exercised, and of that Church which
ought to settle the publick manner of
mens devotions? For the <hi>institution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48703:95"/>
Orders,</hi> and the <hi>obligations of Vows,</hi>
the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> himself doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any power or authority to erect any
<hi>Monastery, Colledge</hi> or <hi>Religious House</hi> in
any Kingdom or Province, without the
consent and approbation of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi>
to whom the Soveraignty belongs; and if
they do admit such institutions to be
made, and such obligations by vows to
be entred into, as are prejudicial to the
peace and happiness of their Dominions,
the institution is theirs, and not the
Popes; and when their reason or their
experience discovers any mischief or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their other subjects, to redound
from those Institutions, either in their <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi>
or by <hi>new orders</hi> and <hi>concessions,</hi> or
that the subjects under those Institutions
are become less their subjects, than their
other fellow-subjects are, and that they
depend more on some foreign Prince than
on them in their own Territories; they
may, and ought to alter the form and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or to suppress if they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the whole; and if they cannot do
this, they cannot provide for the peace
and happiness of the people committed to
their charge: And the like for <hi>fasting,</hi>
(that is, the observation of <hi>publick Fasts)
Celibacy, paying of Tithes,</hi> they can be no
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48703:95"/>
otherwise regulated, than by the Civil
and Ecclesiastical Laws of every Nation
and Province, and are so regulated, and
not in the same manner in all the <hi>Catholick
Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> And
therefore since that is the greatest objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> makes against the reading of
the Scripture, that the <hi>contradictions</hi> which
arise upon those particulars may be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and inflamed into <hi>Heresies</hi> by the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and humor of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> we
will rather acquiesce in the advice of the
<hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that what the <hi>four first general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
did not prohibit us to do, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
continue the practice of; and since
the <hi>Church of England</hi> in conformity with
the purest antiquity, permits and enjoyns
us to <hi>read the Scriptures,</hi> we will obey its
directions, without caring what that of
<hi>Rome</hi> forbids.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> comes now in excuse of
his just indignation against the Doctor's
Principles, to discover a secret that <hi>his
own unhappiness, if not guilt, gave the
first occasion, that those principles should be
known, and received into the Church of
England;</hi> and this discovery must be the
more ingenuous, because <hi>he is sure no man
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48703:96"/>
now alive knows any thing of it;</hi> Then he
tells you a story of his accidental finding,
and buying at a Book-sellers Shop <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Dallies</hi> Book, <hi>Of the true use of the
Fathers,</hi> which <hi>he shewed that night to his
Noble Dear Lord Lucius Lord Falkland,
who reading a little of the Contents, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to give it to him, which he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did, and that my Lord shortly after sent
him a most civil Letter full of thanks, both
in his own, and Mr. Chillingworth's name
for that small present, telling him that that
little Book had saved him a most tedious
labour of reading almost twenty great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,</hi>
and then tells another story of
<hi>Mr. Chillingworth;</hi> and I confess when I
read this notable discovery, and knew that
I was no great stranger to the transactions
which had been in that time in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I could not suddenly comprehend
what his meaning or purpose was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that relation, but I quickly found
that all his meaning was, under the stile
of his <hi>Noble Dear Lord</hi> (as in truth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from him the highest expressions of
gratitude he could utter) to traduce the
memory of that <hi>incomparable Lord,</hi> and to
cause him to be thought a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and I
cannot enough lament that he hath found
credit enough with two or three Persons
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48703:96"/>
of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (who I am sure
never knew, I think never saw that <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Person)</hi> to take upon them to asperse
<hi>a Noble man</hi> of the most <hi>Prodigious learning,</hi>
of the most <hi>exemplar manners,</hi> and <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
good nature,</hi> of the most <hi>unblemished
integrity,</hi> and the <hi>greatest Ornament</hi> of the
Nation, that any Age hath produced,
with the Character of a <hi>Socinian;</hi> Mr.
<hi>Cressy</hi> well knows that before that time
of his Journey into <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Year
<hi>One thousand six hundred thirty eight,</hi> that
<hi>Noble Lord</hi> had perused, and read over
all the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine Fathers,</hi> and
was indefatigable in looking over all
Books, which with great expence he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be transmitted to him from all parts,
and so could not have been long without
<hi>Mr. Dallies Book,</hi> if <hi>Mr. Cressy</hi>'s present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to him, had not given him opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to have raised this scandal upon his
memory, nor could that Book have been
so grateful to him, if he had not read the
<hi>Fathers;</hi> For <hi>Mr. Chillingworth,</hi> if <hi>Mr.
Cressy</hi> had not been very wary in saying
any thing that might redound to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of any of the <hi>present Prelates,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but know that the <hi>present Arch-Bishop
of Canterbury,</hi> had first reclaimed him
from his doubtings, and they were no
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48703:97"/>
more, nor had he ever declared himself a
<hi>Catholick,</hi> except being at <hi>S. Omers</hi> amounts
to such a Declaration, before ever he was
sent for by <hi>Arch-Bishop Laud;</hi> and I am
very much deceived, which I think I am
not in that particular, if <hi>Mr. Chillingworth</hi>'s
Book against <hi>Mr. Knott</hi> was not publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the time of <hi>Mr. Cressy</hi>'s Journey
in <hi>thirty eight,</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I know
had been perused by him, and therefore
<hi>Mr. Dallies</hi> Book could not interrupt him
in his study of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> nor induce
him to fix his mind upon <hi>Socinian grounds,</hi>
which now serves his turn to reproach
all men, and the <hi>Church of England</hi> it
self, for refusing to believe his miracles, or
to submit to that authority to whose blind
guiding he hath lazily given up himself,
and all his faculties; Yet he does so
much honour to <hi>those grounds,</hi> that he
does confess, that they obstructed a good
while his entrance into the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> the contrary whereof I know to
be true, as much as negative can be
true, and that he never thought of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the Religion he now professes,
till long after the death of the <hi>Lord Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Mr. Chillingworth,</hi> nor till the
same <hi>rebellious power</hi> that drove the <hi>King</hi>
out of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> drove him likewise
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48703:97"/>
from the <hi>good preferments</hi> which he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Church,</hi> and then the <hi>necessity,</hi> and
<hi>distraction of his fortune,</hi> together with
the <hi>melancholick,</hi> and <hi>irresolution in his
nature,</hi> prevailed with him to bid farewell
to his own reason and understanding, and
to resign himself to the conduct of those
who had a much worse than his.</p>
            <p>If the having read <hi>Socinus,</hi> and the
commending that in him, which no body
can reasonably discommende in him, and
the making use of that reason that God
hath given a man for the examining of
that which is most properly to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by reason, and to avoid the weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of some men, how superciliously so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
insisted upon, or to discover the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of others, be the definition of a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
the party will be very strong in all
Churches; but if a perfect detestation of all
those Opinions against the <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of our Saviour,</hi> or any other doctrine
that is contrary to the <hi>Church of England</hi>
(and the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
condemned <hi>Socinianism,</hi> than any <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church</hi> hath done, as appears by the
<hi>Canons,</hi> of <hi>One thousand six hundred and
forty)</hi> can free a man from that reproach,
as without doubt it ought to do: I can
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48703:98"/>
very warrantably declare that that <hi>unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
Lord</hi> was no <hi>Socinian,</hi> nor is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for any man who is a <hi>true Son</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> to be corrupted with
any of those Opinions. But in truth if
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath that Prerogative in <hi>Logick,</hi>
as to declare men to be <hi>Socinians,</hi> from
some propositions, which he calls Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which in his judgment will warrant
those deductions, though he confesses <hi>he
does not suspect the Doctor will approve such
consequences, yet he is confident with all his
skill he cannot avoid them,</hi> that is, he is a
<hi>Socinian</hi> before he is aware of it, and in
spight of his teeth; this is such an excess
in the faculty of arguing, as must make
him a <hi>dangerous Neighbour,</hi> and qualifies
him excellently to be a <hi>Commissioner of the
Inquisition,</hi> who have often need of that
kind of subtilty, that will <hi>make Heresies</hi>
which they cannot <hi>find;</hi> All this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to perswade his new friends, of
that which they call the <hi>old Religion,</hi> that
his <hi>old Friend's Religion</hi> is <hi>new,</hi> that they
have no <hi>reverence</hi> for <hi>antiquity,</hi> no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>
for the <hi>Authority of the Fathers,</hi>
and only make use of their <hi>natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
to find out a <hi>new Religion</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whereas in truth whoever will
impartially, and dispassionately make the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48703:98"/>
enquiry, shall find that there is no one
<hi>substantial controversie</hi> between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but
what is matter of <hi>Novelty,</hi> and hath no
foundation in <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
are more diligently read, and studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>our Church,</hi> than they are in <hi>theirs,</hi>
and <hi>more reverence</hi> is paid to them <hi>by us,</hi>
than <hi>by them,</hi> though neither they nor we,
nor any other Christian Church in the
World, do submit or concur in all that the

of <hi>one mind,</hi> and therefore may very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
have <hi>their reasons</hi> examined by the
<hi>reasons of other men;</hi> This that I say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>reading,</hi> and the <hi>reverence</hi>
paid to the <hi>Fathers</hi> ought to be believed
till they can produce one <hi>Prelate,</hi> or
<hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> who
hath ever used such contemptuous words
of the <hi>Fathers, Ego, ut ingenuè fatear,

as any who sate there, in the debate
whether a <hi>Bishop</hi> was Superiour to a

when they who sustained the former,
alledged Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi>

<hi>Mr. Cressy,</hi> and his Friends insult, if a

pa. 468. How would they triumph upon
the modesty of one of our Clergy, if when
he had reckoned up the opinions of most
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon a difficult Text of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> he should conclude, <hi>Sed si meam

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48703:99"/>
in nulla prorsus earum, meum quale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque

upon the 11 verse of the 11 ch. of
St. <hi>Matthew, Qui est minimus in regno Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum

is not whether these very <hi>eminent
Men,</hi> and <hi>great Scholars,</hi> for such they were,
said well, and reasonably, but whether they
who assume this liberty, should reproach
us who never mention the <hi>Fathers</hi> but with
<hi>veneration,</hi> and rarely dissent from them,
but when they dissent from one another,
for taking less liberty, or whether they do
ingenuously to desire the People should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they are so severe observers of
the Doctrine of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tread out of their steps.</p>
            <p>Why may it not become the <hi>Church of
England</hi> to use the same expressions which
<hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi> so long since did in his
<hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon the
<hi>Books of Moses,</hi> in his excuse for having
rejected many expositions of the <hi>Fathers,
Solis sacrae Scripturae authoribus, reservata

become any <hi>particular member</hi> of that

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48703:100"/>
in a <hi>particular expression,</hi> to differ from a
<hi>particular Father,</hi> when <hi>Petavius,</hi> who had
as exactly read the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and was as
great a <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>universal Learning</hi> as
this Age hath produced, presumes to say,

more of the like animadversions, and
detections by <hi>Monsieur Dallie,</hi> anger, &amp; vex
<hi>Mr. Cressy,</hi> and his <hi>new Friends</hi> much
more than any disrespect he is guilty of
towards the <hi>Fathers,</hi> of which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
assign one instance; all that he says,
besides the mentioning them always with
all possible reverence, is no more than
what <hi>Mr. Cressy</hi> says of them, and of the
<hi>four first general Councils,</hi> and which indeed
was the cause of <hi>Monsieur Dallies</hi> writing
that Book, that those <hi>Holy men,</hi> nor the
<hi>times in which they lived,</hi> knew any thing,
or had heard of any of the points, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in <hi>controversie</hi> between us, and the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and therefore that it was
a vain affectation to appeal to them for a
<hi>decision;</hi> I do not much wonder at any
thing <hi>Mr. Cressy</hi> says, upon this argument,
for he owed to himself some extraordinary
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48703:100"/>
observation, to make his tale of present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>unlucky Book</hi> (as he calls it) of
Mr. <hi>Dallie,</hi> to <hi>My Lord Falkland,</hi> and which
he says <hi>perswaded Mr. Chillingworth to have
a light esteem of the Fathers;</hi> but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but admire, and grieve, that he hath
so much credit with any member of the
<hi>Church of England</hi> how obscure soever, as
to perswade him to have the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and thereupon to assume the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and the rashness to asperse (as far
as his talent can contribute unto it) the
memory of that most loved, and most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
<hi>Lord Falkland</hi> (whose name he is
not worthy to pass through his mouth)
with the odious reproach of being a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
and that when no Person of the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath had the courage in so
many years to attempt the answering that
Book <hi>de usu Patrum,</hi> one of the <hi>other
Church</hi> should think it necessary to take
the quarrel upon him, and without any
reason, or any instance of moment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
Mr. <hi>Dallie</hi> with his light esteem of
the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> in language not in any
degree decent: nor was the matter, or the
manner at all necessary to the other part
of his Book concerning the <hi>Church of
England;</hi> nor can any Man who is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make that enquiry, meet with a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48703:101"/>
greater encouragement to pursue it, than
by having read that Book of Mr. <hi>Dallies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am glad I am now come to Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s
<hi>conclusion,</hi> which is not long, and consists
in a <hi>softer</hi> and more <hi>civil</hi> kind of <hi>scolding</hi>
than the other parts of his Book, but with
the <hi>same bitterness,</hi> and hath in truth in it
somewhat of ingenuity a man would not
have expected; for after so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
almost in every page of his Book
of being a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> an <hi>Independent,</hi>
an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> indeed all the calumnies cast
upon him, which a <hi>good wit,</hi> and an <hi>ill
nature</hi> can suggest; he confesses at last that
the Doctor in one of his Books, and the
place he cites, declares, <hi>That the Church of
England upon the greatest enquiry he can
make, is the best Church of the World,</hi> which
is a greater and fuller vindication of him
for all the contumelious aspersions cast on
him, and a more ample and clear testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
because it is more innocent, that he is
a <hi>true son</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> than
any Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> can produce of his being a
<hi>Roman Catholick.</hi> Will any <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
or <hi>Independent,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist</hi> make <hi>that
Declaration?</hi> he well knows they neither
can nor will whilst they retain the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of their parties, and they cease to be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48703:101"/>
of either party assoon as they make <hi>that
declaration;</hi> he confesses that the Doctor
hath subscribed, and submitted to, and
practises all that Church requires of him,
and hath farther unprovoked given this
ample testimony to it, that he was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to do, and which no man can give,
that is divided in his affections, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclined to another Church that differs
from it; and yet he is so jealous of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and security of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
that <hi>Church</hi> that he hath <hi>Apostatized from,</hi>
that <hi>Church</hi> that he hath <hi>traduced</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled</hi>
with all the <hi>scurrility of Language,</hi> of
<hi>this Church</hi> in which he will not permit a
<hi>possibility of Salvation;</hi> he is so careful, that
he will not allow the Doctor to be a <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of it,</hi> but advises like a loving Father,
the <hi>drowzy</hi> and <hi>sleeping Prelates,</hi> to be
watchful over him as <hi>a spy</hi> and <hi>treacherous
person,</hi> who whilst he perswades them
(poor simple creatures) that he will be a
<hi>champion</hi> for their <hi>Church,</hi> endeavours all
he can to <hi>destroy</hi> and <hi>undermine it.</hi> How
will Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> answer to his <hi>Superiors</hi> this
preposterous zeal of his own behalf of a
Church the most odious, and the most
formidable to them, that when it is even
almost undermined by Officers of its own,
who are trusted to search and survey all its
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48703:102"/>
Vaults and most secret Avenues, so that
it is upon the point of falling, by taking
away the strong supporters which have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
upheld it, and erecting rotten or
mouldering pillars in the place, and all
this benefit and advantage may be lost or
prevented by his fond and unseasonable
advertisement, if the King and the Bishops
have prudence enough to make good use
of it, by driving away or discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
such a perfidious and unskilful cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.
May they not from hence appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that as he came to them upon a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and unexpected, so that he is upon
thoughts of returning to the Church for
which he hath so much care, and entering
into a kind of correspondence with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
by giving good counsel how to
behave himself better. But how comes it
to pass that this miserable Doctor who he
yet seems to think may mean well to be so
stupidly couzened and deceived, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of complying with his engagement
to defend the Church, <hi>he hath betrayed her,
and the whole cause to all the Fanatick Sects
which have separated from her, and with most
horrible cruelty sought her destruction, and
with her the ruine of Monarchy?</hi> All this
tragical demolishing of foundations consists
in this, that he allows all sober enquirers
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48703:102"/>
to be for themselves <hi>judges</hi> of the <hi>sence of
Scripture</hi> in <hi>necessaries,</hi> and <hi>judges</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>what points</hi> are <hi>necessary.</hi> This say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his hath betrayed the cause of his
Church, and <hi>left her in a most forlorn condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tottering upon foundations and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which to</hi> Mr. Cressy's <hi>certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
were not extant, at least not known in</hi>
England <hi>thirty years since.</hi> Let it be in the
first place observed (and it is sure worthy
to be observed) that this most pernicious
proposition, which hath in such an instant
brought the <hi>Church of England</hi> into such a
<hi>tottering condition,</hi> is not made use of, nor
so much as taken notice of by any of those
<hi>enemies</hi> of hers, the <hi>Presbyterians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
or <hi>Independents,</hi> who have been
so vigilant and industrious so many years
to make her <hi>totter,</hi> and yet now the work
is so near done to their hands by a <hi>secret
friend,</hi> who is the more able to do them
good, by his not pretending any affection
towards them; neither of them will put
their cause upon that proposition, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to their own designs, and therefore
it is possible that it may not be altogether
so dangerous to the Church, as he would
have it supposed to be, and of which it is
probable he would not have given notice
if he had in truth thought it to be <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48703:103"/>
In the next place let us examine
whether the Doctor himself cannot make
another and better interpretation of his
own words, than his <hi>implacable enemy</hi> hath
done; all good <hi>Physicians</hi> compound their
<hi>Antidotes</hi> according to the nature and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of the <hi>poyson</hi> that their <hi>patients</hi> have
swallowed. Now the <hi>poyson</hi> that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
and his <hi>lurking brethren</hi> usually bait their
traps with, and by which they catch most
of their prey is, Their confident denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>damnation</hi> against those, and all those
who are not of <hi>their mind,</hi> that is, who
are not received into the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
and not intirely submit to all her dictates:
That the <hi>Scripture</hi> consists in <hi>dumb letters,</hi>
which cannot declare its <hi>own meaning,</hi> and
therefore is liable to be misinterpreted by
the <hi>wit</hi> of <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>presumptuous men,</hi> as the
founders of all <hi>Heresies</hi> have been; and
therefore they can only be safe who receive
and conform themselves to that <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> (in the
custody of which it is deposited) <hi>hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
and declared to be <hi>Orthodox.</hi> That
<hi>that Church</hi> is the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> where
there constantly resides a <hi>Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>
who, in case any <hi>new opinions</hi> shall
start up to the prejudic of <hi>Religion,</hi> which
have not been enough convinced by <hi>former
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48703:103"/>
definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> hath full authority
committed to him by <hi>our Saviour</hi> to <hi>declare</hi>
and <hi>determine</hi> what is <hi>agreeable</hi> or <hi>contrary</hi>
to the <hi>sence of the Scripture,</hi> since it cannot
be supposed that <hi>our Saviour</hi> would <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>
an <hi>officer,</hi> and not indue him with
all <hi>necessary faculties,</hi> or not <hi>qualifie</hi> him
sufficiently for the <hi>discharge</hi> of so great a
<hi>trust;</hi> and from hence they resolve, that
the greatest <hi>danger of damnation</hi> is not from
the <hi>commission</hi> of those <hi>sins</hi> against which
the <hi>spirit of God</hi> hath so plainly denounced
it, but in an <hi>obstinate presumption</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
the opinions or directions of the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and refusing to submit
to the authority of the <hi>Vicar of Christ,</hi> who
hath the unquestionable power to <hi>bind</hi>
and to <hi>loose,</hi> to <hi>pardon</hi> and to <hi>condemn sins,</hi>
having the <hi>Keys of Heaven,</hi> and of <hi>Hell;</hi>
and therefore whilst they will depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and put themselves under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
they cannot but be safe.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>common poyson</hi> which these
men carry about them to administer to
those who they find most like to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and in the <hi>composition</hi> of it there are
some <hi>ingredients</hi> according to the <hi>humour
of the compounder,</hi> which cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Catholick prescription,</hi> since
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48703:104"/>
that Soveraign power of their <hi>Supreme
Magistrate</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> is not, nor ever will
be acknowledged to be an <hi>essential part</hi> of
the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion.</hi> Let us now
see what Antidote the Doctor hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the prevention or expulsion of this
poyson; to confirm men in their absolute
confidence and dependence upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the force and virtue whereof that
poyson would enervate; he says, <hi>That it
is repugnant to the nature of the design, to the
wisdom and goodness of God to give an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
assurance to persons, in writing his will
for the benefit of mankind, if those writings
may not be understood by all persons, who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
endeavour to know the meaning of
them, in all such things as are necessary for
their Salvation, and consequently there can
be no necessity supposed of any infallible society
of men, either to attest or explain those wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
amongst Christians;</hi> and this, and no
more than this is the sence of that, which
contains all that confusion which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
thinks must bring confusion upon his <hi>own
Church,</hi> as into that of the <hi>Roman,</hi> and
from thence the Doctor proceeds to shew
how <hi>incompetent a Magistrate</hi> they have
chosen to determine all <hi>differences in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
which he proves by such arguments,
as are very natural for the proving thereof,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48703:104"/>
and for the answering, &amp; avoiding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we shall be compelled anon to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s admirable artifice, and
dexterity; Now if the Doctor hath for
want of skill in discerning consequences,
made choice of an <hi>improper medium</hi> to prove
that which he hath a mind to prove, God
forbid that there should be such <hi>Tragical
effects</hi> to attend that argumentation, as the
<hi>destruction of Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and it
would be as unreasonable to condemn an
argument, that he who uses it thinks to
his purpose, because it was never used till
within <hi>thirty Years;</hi> One man says that the
Scripture is so very difficult, that no man
can understand it, without repairing to the
advice of an adversary, who will tell him
the interpretation of it, to which he is to
conform, let the advice be never so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his own judgment and reason; The
other answers that the understanding all
the places of Scripture is so difficult, that
men had need to consult very much about
it, yet that whatsoever is necessary towards
salvation is contained in such easie places
of Scripture, that every man who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
enquires to know the meaning of
them, may easily do it, and is ready to name
those places in which there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
nor any difficulty hath yet been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48703:105"/>
the believing of which, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himself hath declared to be enough for
Salvation: Oh! but (says he) the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of this proposition makes every
man the <hi>judge</hi> of his <hi>own Religion,</hi> and he
may be of <hi>what Religion he pleases;</hi> The
question is not, what the consequence is,
which few men agree upon, one conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
seeming natural to one, and another
to an other, but whether the averment be
a good answer to the other suggestion,
when an other more weighty argument is
urged, an other answer shall be applied,
without the reach of his consequences, and
yet the Doctor hath never said, <hi>that no man
hath need of any information, or advice even
in the easiest places of Scripture,</hi> and so <hi>that
Coblers and Laundresses may choose a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
for themselves,</hi> nor doth believe that
any sober cr sincere enquirer, will fail in
asking advice of those to whom he
ought to repair, if that which seems to
others most easie, appear hard to him, nor
can any man appear to himself to be a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or sincere enquirer, without enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to help his ill understanding, and
then even the <hi>Laundress</hi> or the <hi>Cobler</hi> will
be out of Mr. <hi>Cressy's</hi> reach by his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of damnation, which will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
appear to them to have no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48703:105"/>
in Scripture, but to be a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
against it.</p>
            <p>Certainly it is a new way, and a new
Law imposed upon the handling of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
and was not in practice thirty
Years since, that a man can no sooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a proposition (let it be new, and not
known to be urged before) towards the
confirmation of a Principle in <hi>one Religion,</hi>
or towards enervating a principle in <hi>an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
but that proposition is called a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
and thereupon all the ill consequences
are deduced from it, that may serve turn
to asperse his Person, wound his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to make the unhappy man who
hath not been sharp-sighted enough in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
to discern those consequences, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to any one of them, be looked upon,
and abhorred as a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or if that be
thought worse, of a <hi>Turk;</hi> for the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
by well stroking, will be stretched
as well to <hi>the one,</hi> as to <hi>the other,</hi> and the
case of this <hi>unhappy disputer</hi> is the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
because though he intends very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
and acknowledges none of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
that is only by his ignorance of
what passes in his own mind, which a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger
man than himself hath discovered,
and assures him, and can easily prove that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48703:106"/>
he doth believe that, which he protests he
doth not believe, by which no <hi>Classis of men</hi>
seem to be liable to <hi>so many woes,</hi> as they
who make <hi>false syllogismes,</hi> and they who
cannot discover when they are false, for
both these will be perplexed with ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
according to the mercifulness of
the <hi>subtle man,</hi> who hath the handling of
the man, and the matter. If I will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the authority to which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
will subject me to, because he says the
Church requires my subjection, and I tell
him that it is an <hi>irrational claim,</hi> and my
reason cannot therefore submit to it; If I
will not believe what he hath in his hand
to be a <hi>flint,</hi> when he suffers me to <hi>handle
it,</hi> and to <hi>put it</hi> into my <hi>mouth,</hi> because my
senses tell me that it is a <hi>piece of butter:</hi> I
am presently concluded to be a man, who
will examine all matters relating to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by <hi>natural reason,</hi> and make my <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Senses</hi> the <hi>sole judges</hi> of the <hi>mysteries
of Faith,</hi> and of the <hi>interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and therefore I am a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and do
neither believe the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation,</hi>
nor the other <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and
therefore no Name can be bad enough for
me, nor is it any matter what I say. And
after all this, I am no <hi>Socinian,</hi> and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and all the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48703:106"/>
other <hi>Elements of Religion,</hi> and my reason
obliges me to believe them, because they
being all matters of fact, are manifested by
such evidence, that I cannot suspect nor can
my reason contradict, though all the parts
of it, it cannot comprehend. Doth not the
most <hi>abstracted reason</hi> oblige me to believe
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> contains nothing in it, but
what is <hi>true,</hi> when I have as great a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
as the subject is capable of, that it
is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and therefore it must be
<hi>true;</hi> yet when Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(as he frequently does in all his <hi>Bulls</hi>)
applies a Text of Scripture to a very light,
or erroneous purpose, the same reason may
enable and warrant me to declare, that such
an interpretation is not reasonable, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is to be rejected; Must that greatest
faculty that God hath bestowed upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
(and therefore bestowed it upon him
that he may judge by it) reason, be laid aside
or cast away, because there are some few
things above the reach of it? and yet even
when that is true (for it is often thought
to be true, when it is not, and that some
things are above reason which are not) <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
shall contribute more to that obedience
that is requisite, than any <hi>stupid resignation</hi>
to <hi>such authority,</hi> as every day betrays it self
in some <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>wilful determination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:48703:107"/>
It is more than probable that very many
learned and pious men may be so partial to
the Doctor, as to believe that he is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
skilled in <hi>Logick,</hi> and to foresee all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</hi>
which may <hi>naturally follow</hi> from
any <hi>proposition</hi> or <hi>principle</hi> he makes use of,
and that he can make it evident that none
of those <hi>direful consequences</hi> do result from
them, which Mr. <hi>Cressy's</hi> subtilty doth
discern, and if this should be so, his friends
will have cause to wish, that he had not
been so transported with passion; for two
principles which he hath made choice of
out of thirty (whereas if half the other
twenty eight sufficiently evince what he
would have, his work is done) which
the Doctor for his ease had abridged in the
end of his Book, that he hath upon the
matter left all the rest of his Book, at least
those parts which are most dangerous to
the <hi>Roman allegation</hi> unanswered and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and that he hath made too much
hast to his conclusion, and to his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Declaration on his own behalf, of
the right and justice whereof he makes so
little doubt, that having treated
his adversary with that meekness from the
beginning of his Book, he charitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with giving him good counsel upon
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48703:107"/>
the peril of his damnation; and truly the
manner of his excusing his so brief answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Book, that is, his not answering
it at all, is very well worth the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. It may be the Doctor was consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to himself of having said many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
throughout his Book, which had
not been urged above thirty years since;
and upon the petulancy of Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> and
some other of his friends, were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
necessary to be pressed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was so wary, as to quote <hi>Catholick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
to justifie all that he alledged, the
controversie being upon matter of fact,
which need no other proof on his side, than
the authority he cited, and which in truth
is not capable of any other answer, but
that he hath alledged somewhat that is not
true. But that he says plainly he will not
examine, for he <hi>observes in the Doctors Book
a world of quotations out of Authors he never
saw, nor intends to see, containing many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
stories, and many ridiculous passages of
things done or said by several Catholicks in
former, and some in later times.</hi> He says,
<hi>If he had a mind to examine and say something
in answer to them, an impossibility of finding
out those Authors must have been his excuse;
but he hath a better excuse than that, for if
the Doctor would have lent him those Books
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48703:108"/>
out of his Library, he should have thanked
him for his civility, but should have refused
to make use of his offer; for to what purpose
would it have been to turn over a heap of
Books to find out quotations in which neither
the Church or himself is concerned? Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi>
he says, <hi>though they had been opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or actions even of Popes themselves; it is
to him all one whether his allegations be true
or false,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 172. which is one of the
most haughty resolutions and declarations
for a man who doth in the next page call
for an applause for having so clearly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
his adversary, that hath been
heard of; all those quotations are the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies</hi>
of <hi>Catholick writers,</hi> which prove
somewhat that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> denies or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts,
somewhat that he and his friends
have confidently affirmed; and by doing
so, have obliged him to produce that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the truth whereof he will not
vouchsafe to examine, because it is all one
to him, whether the allegations be true
or false. An admirable answer! He
thinks it very reasonable to magnifie his
Religion upon <hi>visions,</hi> and <hi>apparitions,</hi> and
<hi>miracles,</hi> but cares not for <hi>quotations</hi> out of
<hi>Catholick Authors,</hi> of <hi>dismal stories</hi> and <hi>many
ridiculous passages</hi> of things said and done
by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which are therefore cited
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48703:108"/>
toprove the frequent and common <hi>delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in those <hi>visions,</hi> and <hi>apparitions,</hi> and
<hi>miracles,</hi> it's all one to him, whether
these allegations be true or false. That is
very strange, if he should say that in all
times the <hi>Popes</hi> have constantly been the
protectors of all vertue and chastity; can
any answer be more pertinent, than the
testimony of all the <hi>Catholick writers</hi> of that
time, that after a world of other impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
committed by him, a <hi>Gentleman of
Rome</hi> found <hi>Pope Iohn the Twelfth</hi> in bed
with his wife, and killed him? Can it be
all one to him whether this allegation be
true or false? Is it possible that he is not
concerned in the opinion and actions of
<hi>Popes,</hi> whose persons he declares as a point
of <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> to be necessarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be the <hi>conservators</hi> of the <hi>purity of
Religion,</hi> and the <hi>determiners</hi> of any <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
that shall arise or start up; and he hath
still that comfort, that he is assured, <hi>That
never Pope yet how wicked soever did bring
any Heresie into the Church;</hi> now is not he
concerned (though I cannot blame him
for not daring to peruse or examine the
Records of such deviations) when he is put
in mind of <hi>Pope Liberius,</hi> who though he
did not bring <hi>Arrianism</hi> into the Church,
did support and maintain it, when he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48703:109"/>
found it there, and being <hi>Pope,</hi> became
<hi>Arrian,</hi> which may periwade a man to
believe that our Saviour did not depute
him as his deputy to determine controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
in Faith. These and much other vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this kind he preserves himself from
by his firm resolution not to examine any
of the Doctors quotations; but whether
he be so absolutely unconcerned in them,
whether they be true or false, shall be left
to his own party to judge.</p>
            <p>Nothing will concern Mr. <hi>Cressy unless
the Doctor will undertake to demonstrate that
it is unlawful, or but considerably dangerous to
be a member of a Church where any persons do
or have lived, who have been obnoxious to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
or guilty of ill actions;</hi> and in this he
hath wisely provided for his own
ease, for he is sure the Doctor will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to make any such demonstration,
and yet it may be it is one of the best argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by which he hath gained most of
the Proselytes he hath made. There is
great difference, as hath been said before,
between <hi>remaining in a Church,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
errors are received and practised, and
ill actions are committed, and <hi>leaving</hi> and
<hi>renouncing a Church</hi> upon pretence of some
errors in it, to run into another Church
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48703:109"/>
which hath the same, or greater errors.
But the difference is yet greater between
<hi>errors in a Church,</hi> and <hi>errors of a Church,</hi>
errors and vices committed, and practised
<hi>in a Church,</hi> and errors and vices commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and practised <hi>by a Church,</hi> such as the
Church it self knows to be errors, and
many men believe the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of many of those. I will not mention
the common objection of the <hi>worshipping of
Images,</hi> which the Church carefully dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims,
and takes it very ill that <hi>any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
should be thought <hi>so brutish</hi> as to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Image</hi> in <hi>wood</hi> or <hi>stone,</hi> and yet the
sufficient evidence of that <hi>brutality</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with some <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>General
Councils</hi> utterly to suppress them, and take
them out of all Churches; and very pious
and learned <hi>Catholicks</hi> have since, and still
do very heartily with that they were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
for the scandal it brings upon the
Church: For let that declare what it will,
nothing is <hi>more notorious,</hi> than that more
than the common people do <hi>literally</hi> and
<hi>really</hi> pay <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>very Image;</hi> nor
are they without reason to perswade them
that there is a peculiar vertue in it; for
why should the <hi>Saint</hi> be more propitious in
one place than another, if the address were
only to the <hi>Saint,</hi> and not some advantage
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48703:110"/>
in the <hi>Image it self?</hi> Why should so many
<hi>more miracles</hi> be done by <hi>our Lady</hi> in one
place than another, insomuch as there is
no <hi>Catholick Province</hi> but hath <hi>distinct
Images</hi> of her, which receives more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
visits</hi> than others, and works
more <hi>wonderful effects?</hi> Who can read the
life of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and find him with that
fervour and vehemence in his devotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> that the <hi>Image bowed it self,</hi>
and with both the arms <hi>imbraced him,</hi> and
then returned to the stiffness of its posture?
This is testified in the most authentick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Church hath of <hi>his life;</hi> but
there are too many particulars in the <hi>lives
of the Saints</hi> to charge the Church with
believing, and therefore it may be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at that they are so much countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
But the instance I would insist upon
is our <hi>Ladies House at Lauretta,</hi> which is
alledged to have remained still at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi>
till after the year <hi>twelve hundred,</hi>
(time enough to have reduced the greatest
Palaces into dust) but that after that time
(some <hi>Catholick writers</hi> name the year
when it begun its <hi>journey)</hi> it was taken by
<hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>very house</hi> in which the lived,
and had received the <hi>salutation</hi> from the
<hi>Angel,</hi> and carried to a <hi>mountain in Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
and at three stages more, whereof
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48703:110"/>
one was a <hi>wood</hi> belonging to a widow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> many years rest interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
it was brought to, and left in the
place where it <hi>now stands,</hi> and where it is
covered with the most <hi>rich</hi> and very <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Church,</hi> which for the good widows
sake, in whose wood it rested some years,
is called <hi>Lauretta,</hi> and where <hi>her Image</hi>
and <hi>her House</hi> receives <hi>visits,</hi> and very <hi>rich
presents</hi> from all parts where the <hi>Catholick
Religion</hi> is professed, for the reception and
entertainment whereof a good <hi>Town</hi> is
built, several <hi>Religious houses, Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
made thither from far and near, and
hereby that people may without going so
far as <hi>Nazareth</hi> see the house of our <hi>Ladies
abode;</hi> the Church in Plate and Jewels is
richer than any other in the world; not to
speak of the incredible number of <hi>miracles</hi>
which have been wrought there since the
miraculous coming of that Cottage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I dare not ask Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> whether
he doth believe this wonderful voyage or
progress, because I dare not say he doth
not, since he hath brought his reason and
his judgment into such a marvellous cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity;
but I would presume to ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church, as it can be contracted
into that denomination, (for if the <hi>Pope</hi>
be enough the Church to declare Heresies,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48703:111"/>
and determine controversies which are yet
undetermined, methinks he should be
Church enough to answer questions, and
in this particular he is more concerned,
for being a Soveraign temporal Prince in
his own Dominions, as well as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Prelate, he is in some degree an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
for the discretion and the good
manners, as well as the Religion and the
Faith of his subjects:) May we ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may be presumed that he and his
<hi>Consistory,</hi> with which he consults in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of importance, that he doth believe
this miracle, or may it be presumed he
doth not? To say he doth believe it, is to
accuse him of such an impotency of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as the most <hi>illiterate Frier</hi> is
hardly guilty of, as to imagine that a thing
so <hi>monstrous in nature,</hi> and so <hi>impertinent</hi>
as to any <hi>pious</hi> or <hi>prudent effect,</hi> can be
true. To say that God can do as much,
is an answer that may as well support the
most <hi>notorious fiction</hi> that is in <hi>Ovid's Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis;</hi>
and it may be as well replied,
that God if he had done it, would have
provided some such <hi>witnesses</hi> in the way,
as should have made it manifest that he
had done it, whereas they who have been
at so prodigious a charge in beautifying
and enriching that <hi>little mansion,</hi> have not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48703:111"/>
yet been able to purchase <hi>one Record</hi> of so
long a voyage, but satisfie themselves that
they who take the pains to come thither,
do easily believe it, whereas more go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to see those who do pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, than to see <hi>the Relique</hi> that draws
men thither.</p>
            <p>I never spoke with any <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>
who knew so much of the story as I have
here mentioned (for most that have been
there, or have heard of the stories of it,
have heard no more than that <hi>our Ladies
own House</hi> is there, and for ought they
know <hi>Nazareth</hi> may be within three miles
of it) who hath pretended to believe it,
he was not bound to it, it was not of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
faith,</hi> it might be of <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
faith.</hi> I ask him whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
it as much as he doth that <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
was <hi>Emperor of Rome?</hi> That he cannot
say neither. In a word, <hi>most Catholicks</hi>
laugh at it, as much as I do, and many of
them are as angry at it; so that I suppose it
may become us to conclude that the <hi>Pope</hi>
doth not believe it to be <hi>true,</hi> or rather
that he knows it to be a <hi>fiction;</hi> and if that
be so, with what conscience and sincerity
can he suffer, or indeed permit such a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry</hi>
to be acted in his Territories to the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48703:112"/>
delusion of so many millions of Christians,
and to the scandal and <hi>opprobrium</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in exposing the dignity of the <hi>Mother
of our Lord</hi> to so much derision, only for
his own benefit and advantage; for it's no
small revenue that accrews to the <hi>Pope's
Exechequer</hi> by the visitation and adoration
of that <hi>Mansion of our Lady.</hi> Many come
to <hi>Rome</hi> in a year for no other reason than
that they may worship <hi>our Lady</hi> at <hi>Lauret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and many go thither immediately
without going to <hi>Rome,</hi> as lately a great
<hi>Ecclesiastical Prince</hi> did, and returned
without so much as seeing the <hi>Pope,</hi> after
he had for the cure of his <hi>Hypochondriack in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition</hi>
liberally presented <hi>our Lady</hi> with
as many Jewels as are worth above <hi>five
thousand pounds Sterling,</hi> which she could
not but receive very graciously, yet his
infirmity hath encreased ever since, though
it may be his Present hath much added to
the devotion of the place; for the fight of
the richness of the <hi>Copes</hi> and <hi>Plate,</hi> and
other <hi>Utensils</hi> is a great part of the business
of the <hi>Visitants:</hi> Though it was a very
<hi>pertinent scoffe</hi> upon the occasion that was
used by a <hi>Legate in France,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Pope</hi> himself, when he passed in
state through that Kingdom, and found
all passages thronged with people, who
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48703:112"/>
upon their knees implored and expected
his <hi>benediction;</hi> he repeated it often, with
the usual ceremony of making the <hi>sign of
the Cross,</hi> with these reiterated words, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulgus
vult decipi, decipiatur;</hi> however, I
say, it might be a proper <hi>benediction</hi> for such
occasion in the high-way, yet to induce
men to so <hi>solemn Pilgrimages,</hi> and to the
performance of so <hi>solemn acts</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi>
there ought to be some such <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
foundation</hi> of it, as may be a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to <hi>real piety,</hi> which can hardly be
imagined in this case; and I cannot tell
whether it were not rather to be wished
that the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi>
of the <hi>Roman Court,</hi> did at the expence of
their reputation really believe all that
<hi>Machine,</hi> than suffer it to be shewed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their own believing it at the expence
of their <hi>sanctity,</hi> at least of their <hi>ingenuity.</hi>
Nor could it seem strange to any man, if
an honest man of a good understanding,
who hath not been moped in his education
with such discourses, and hath in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of his own satisfaction fallen into some
doubts of things practised in his own, shall,
if he had no other exception to it, refuse to
cast himself into the arms of such a Church
that seems to believe, or without belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to countenance such an imposture,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48703:113"/>
or any other thing contrary to <hi>common
sense,</hi> and repugnant to all <hi>motions of
Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will not part with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
without kindly putting him in mind
of his Souls health, and that being a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
<hi>English Protestant he will find an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
denounced, ipso facto, against
all such as shall (in the manner there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed)
openly oppose any thing contained in
the Nine and thirty Articles, in the Book of
Common-Prayer, and of Ordinations of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Priests, &amp;c. which Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
(he says) <hi>is there declared to remain
in force, till the Offender repent of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
errour, which he ought to revoke;</hi> Having
told him this, he wishes him to <hi>reflect upon
his Book called Irenicum,</hi> long since publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, and <hi>comparing it with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Church, ratified with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi>
and thereupon to <hi>ask his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
whether he hath not incurred that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
since his guilt having been
publick and notorious, no repentance, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation
appears, &amp;c.</hi> He foresees that
himself (who hath so often subscribed to
those constitutions, and so often taken those
Oaths which accompanie them) will be
thought liable to that Excommunication,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48703:113"/>
having so apparently renounced all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
and shewed no other repentance
than in a constant reviling and malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Church in which he received
his Baptism, and therefore to clear himself
from reproach, he declares that the Doctor,
cannot doubt of the validity, or legality of
that Excommunication, he for his part
may, so the Doctor is to look only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
But if Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> had not been in great
hast, as it cannot be denied that he hath
used great expedition in his conclusion, he
might have thought himself obliged for
the more full conviction of the Doctor to
have alledged those particulars in his <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum,</hi>
which have involved him in <hi>that
Excommunication,</hi> and then that that Book
was published by him after he had subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the <hi>Thirty nine Articles, &amp;c.</hi> neither
of which he hath done, nor I believe will
ever be able to do; I confess I have not
the <hi>Irenicum</hi> now in my reach, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must only resort to Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> himself
for a vindication, and methinks he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
very fairly to it in a testimony he
gives him (pa. 100) without any purpose
of good will towards him, where he says,
<hi>It cannot be denied, but that the Doctor did
not, during the late calamities, joyn in the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
for destroying the Church, he was no root,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48703:114"/>
and branch enemy, but on the contrary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
undertook their defence, and with great
boldness told his then Masters</hi> (in his Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum)
<hi>that though Episcopal Government, and
Ordinations, as likewise Deans and Chapters
(which anciently were the Bishops Councils)
were not necessary, nor perhaps convenient as
matters then stood, yet neither was their utter
destruction, they might if the state pleased be
retained without sin;</hi> in all which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
he hath laid an indelible reproach
upon the Doctor, but I must tell him, that
he hath therein given a larger testimony
of the Doctor's courage, and affection to
the Church, than all his revilings will
be able to deface; For a <hi>young Scholar</hi>
who had then no obligation to the Church
by Oaths, or Subscriptions, and knew little
of the constitution of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to tell his Masters (as he justly calls
them) who had newly <hi>Murthered their
King,</hi> and perswaded the People to believe
that <hi>Bishops</hi> were therefore suppressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were <hi>Anti-christian,</hi> that they
might still be retained without sin, was
such a flat contradiction to the Doctrine
they would have the People be taught,
that he shewed more courage in saying so,
than all the <hi>English Catholick Clergy</hi> ever
expressed, who owed as much Allegiance
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48703:114"/>
to the King, or would be thought to owe
as much, as any of his other Subjects, yet
never wrote one line, or published one Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
against whatsoever the Rebels said, or
did; He might well say that <hi>Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Ordination were not necessary
as matters then stood,</hi> in a Government
whose foundation was laid in the most
<hi>precious blood</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and the most
<hi>horrid Sacriledge,</hi> and <hi>Murthers</hi> that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perpetrated by Christians, and when no
<hi>honest man</hi> would, or could be made a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;</hi>
But it is too much countenance to
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s unwarranted calumnies to take
pains to absolve the Doctor from his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions,
who stands an object of <hi>reverence</hi>
and <hi>esteem,</hi> with all men who have <hi>either</hi>
for the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However such is Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s modesty,
that for the excellent performance of his
task, he <hi>desires no other Iudges but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of the Doctor's own Church,</hi> which
could have been no excuse for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
my <hi>poor opinion</hi> in the matter; but
when he so frankly calls upon any <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Reader to judge between them two,
whether with better success he hath defended
the cause of the Church of England against
the Church of Rome, or he</hi> (Mr. Cressy) <hi>the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48703:115"/>
cause of the Doctor's own Church against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
I may hope that I may be looked upon
as one of those indifferent Readers who
is called upon or authorized by him to
speak my opinion in the matter, and upon
that supposition I do assure him upon the
reputation of an <hi>old Friend,</hi> that he hath
very much hurt his own Church, in his
very passionate, and uncomely way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
her, and in seeming to look upon
some very <hi>Excentrick Lives</hi> in the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of most learned Catholicks, as <hi>essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
parts</hi> of their Religion, and to make
such <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Dreams,</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi>
the very <hi>foundations</hi> of the <hi>Romish faith,</hi>
which the most credulous in the Church
do but believe are possible to be true; and
the wisest, and most learned think never
to have been: and lastly in undertaking to
answer a Book, which upon his own, or
his Associates clamour was necessarily to be
full of citations of <hi>Catholick Authors,</hi> and
<hi>Testimonies,</hi> contrary to what he averred,
and without applying any answer to them,
to declare <hi>that he will not examine them, nor
cares whether they are true or false.</hi> So that
his whole Book consists in nothing else
(besides the petulant, &amp; insolent language)
but finding fault with the method of the
Doctor's arguing, and his making use of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48703:115"/>
               <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>other Principles,</hi> than have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
been insisted upon in arguments of
this kind, and leaves all the material parts
of the Book unanswered, which possibly
may make his Superiours believe that he
hath not performed the task they imposed
upon him very laudably; For the Doctor
having solidly discharged all that can be
expected from him, he needs no such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and obscure testimony as mine, which
can do him no good, but he hath the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the <hi>King</hi> himself, and
the <hi>Church,</hi> whose <hi>worthy Champion</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be esteemed, and it is like he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
the work the better, because Mr.
<hi>Cressy,</hi> and so many of his Associates are
so much offended, and do so bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
against <hi>his Principles,</hi> and all for
the <hi>novelty of them;</hi> that is, he says some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that hath not been said before, and
which they are not provided to answer,
which is rather an argument that all
disputing is to little purpose, and that it
is time to give it over, because neither
party is reformed, than that what he says
is easie to be answered; there will be
every day <hi>new Principles, new Arguments</hi>
to inform, and convince, and convert
those who obstinately persist in <hi>old Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;</hi>
They who are but moderately ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48703:116"/>
in the Controversies about the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
points</hi> in difference between the
<hi>Protestants</hi> (I mean which are common
with all Protestants) and the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> cannot but find that the <hi>Romish
Champions</hi> have quite <hi>shifted the Scene</hi> in
all their arguments upon the most <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
matters,</hi> and have found <hi>new mediums</hi>
to support their cause; They are visibly
weary (all but the <hi>Iesuits)</hi> of insisting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Popes infallibility,</hi> you scarce meet
with an argument from it in any Book
that is Printed, nor can you engage them
in it upon discourse; They are with great
difficulty drawn into the matter of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
but presently shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the shadow of their Church,
and if they cannot avoid enlarging upon
it, they neither use argument, or answer
that ever <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relied upon, being
not satisfied with much he said in that
point, or <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or some <hi>other matters</hi>
which he hath handled more at large; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that it hath been observed these
many years, that <hi>Bellarmine's Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
are so gathered up, that they are not
easie to be procured amongst the <hi>greatest
Book-sellers,</hi> and if they are ever reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they will pass a <hi>severe expurgation;</hi>
In these varieties, and lawful changes of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48703:116"/>
the method, and order of disputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
learned men, which cannot but be
administred by the often saying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the same things, which are often
evinced by a <hi>new medium,</hi> after it hath
been long unmoveable by <hi>an old,</hi> why
should it only be unlawful, or incongruous
in the Doctor, or any other Writer in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the <hi>Church of England</hi> to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>new principles,</hi> if they will better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the maintenance of <hi>old truths,</hi>
and which it is plain doth stagger them,
and forces them to fall upon the Person,
and decline the matter? yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
for the ending all disputes which
are full of obstinacy, and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to concur in the reference, and
how ill soever Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
from the beginning of his Book
hitherto, I am intirely of his mind in the
matter, and very words of his conclusion,
<hi>That there is a horrible depravation in the
minds, especially of Ecclesiasticks, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
can now only be cured by the
wisdom, and power of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>
and to his wisdom and severity I
leave it.</p>
            <p>I have now waited upon <hi>Mr. Cressy</hi>
to the end of his Book, and I think
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48703:117"/>
have not left any clause in it of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
unanswered; and before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
I shall observe <hi>Mr. Cressy</hi>'s own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in giving him some Counsel, and
Advice, without taking much notice of
his Post-script, in which there is little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of new matter, but from the same
temper of spirit some variety of bitterness,
with some new very ill words; He wishes
that <hi>if the Doctor thinks not himself obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in Conscience by breaking all Rules of
piety and humanity to do all manner of
despight to his Catholick fellow Subjects, he
would hereafter please to abstain from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling,
and blaspheming Gods Saints, or
traducing the most divine exercises of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
Souls more perfectly practised
only in Heaven;</hi> Alas! the Doctor wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and desires that all the <hi>English Roman
Catholicks,</hi> against whose corrupt opinions
he hath with much <hi>strength of reason,</hi>
and very <hi>little passion,</hi> writ very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
but never against their Persons, would
be his <hi>Fellow-subjects,</hi> give that evidence,
and security of, and for their fidelity, as
their <hi>Fellow-subjects</hi> do; That they would
disclaim all kind of <hi>subjection</hi> to any <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Soveraign,</hi> and which till they do
(and which the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> cannot
hinder them from doing) they cannot
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48703:117"/>
reckon themselves, nor be accounted by
others, his <hi>Fellow-subjects;</hi> And I do
heartily wish (not without some appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension)
that <hi>Mr. Cressy</hi> hath not by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all rules of modesty, and discretion,
brought more prejudice upon the Persons
of his <hi>fellow-Catholicks,</hi> than all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
want of humanity hath done; It
was a little too soon to awaken all the
<hi>Protestants of England,</hi> that they might
discern in what an ill condition they must
be in, if that <hi>Catholick spirit</hi> that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
it self unwarily in him, and others
of his fraternity, should have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence,
or much countenance in the
State. To his <hi>blaspheming, and reviling
Gods Saints</hi> so absurdly charged upon
him, enough hath been said before, nor
is there evidence to induce the most cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
man to believe that all those are
<hi>Gods Saints,</hi> which stand in <hi>Mr. Cressy's
Calender of Saints,</hi> and it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly
done that only one single line
was not expunged, if there was no more
that gave the occasion of mentioning
<hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasmes,</hi>
which extorted from the Doctor all those
animadversions, which put the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so much rage and fury, that for the
support of that one onely line, he hath
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48703:118"/>
writ this whole Book, that in every
line is full of nothing but <hi>Miracles,</hi> and
<hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>divine exercise of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Souls,</hi> which by his favour, is as
<hi>new a Principle</hi> to defend the <hi>Romish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
by, as any the Doctor hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
against it, and surely contains more
of that kind of Learning, than all the
Books of pure, aud solid Controversie
that have been written since <hi>Luther</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
his Separation, as if he had a mind
to put the <hi>verity</hi> of the <hi>Lives of the
Saints</hi> in issue, and to be strictly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
from which affectation I suppose his
Superiours will divert him, that <hi>they</hi> and
<hi>their Miracles</hi> may be left to their own
repose: And for his most <hi>divine exercise
of contemplative Souls, more perfectly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
only in Heaven,</hi> which is another
<hi>new principle,</hi> and which, and the like,
must unavoidably be examined by <hi>new
methods,</hi> and <hi>argumentations,</hi> it would be
much better to leave those <hi>obscure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations</hi>
to the Persons who delight
in them, and find relief by them, which
we may charitably hope is better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by them, than comprehended by
us; but if they will not keep their <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
privately to themselves for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
correspondence and conversation, but
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48703:118"/>
will constitute a <hi>new language</hi> in <hi>old words,</hi>
for the information, and amazement of
other men, and will be then offended,
and shortly after condemn them for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without the effects, which pious
Souls naturally produce; they should not
take it ill, if men who patiently hear
what they say, do in truth believe that
they themselves are without any <hi>clear
notions,</hi> and can draw <hi>no sence</hi> out of that
<hi>mist of words</hi> in which it is concealed.
<hi>Mental Prayer</hi> (which they would fain
make their imaginations understood by)
is a faculty every devout man compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends,
it signifying no more than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
that <hi>in thought,</hi> which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
done <hi>in speech,</hi> and thoughts are as
plain, and easie to be understood as words
can, and whoever cannot express plainly
and clearly to an other man whatever he
thinks, rather <hi>dreams</hi> than <hi>thinks;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the very <hi>noise of words</hi> do very oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
at least with some men, <hi>disturb,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt,</hi>
or <hi>divert the thoughts,</hi> they do pray
very allowably, and effectually, and it may
be more powerfully, who apply themselves
to God, by fixing their <hi>silent thoughts</hi> upon
<hi>God,</hi> and upon what they desire of Him,
without using any words at all, and this is
<hi>mental Prayer,</hi> which probably may keep
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48703:119"/>
the mind more, and longer bent towards
God, than the pronunciation of words
will enable or suffer it to be; and yet I
doubt it must have <hi>frequent intermission,</hi>
and <hi>relaxation,</hi> and <hi>contemplation</hi> may
hold its vigour longer upon <hi>other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
than in the exercise of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are not to be blamed, and it may
be less in our Country, which hath and
doth still suffer by men and women too of
<hi>disturbed fancies,</hi> who pretend to <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Illuminations,</hi> and such <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asms,</hi>
not only to introduce many <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
opinions</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> but to warrant
and justifie <hi>unquiet</hi> and <hi>seditious actions</hi> in
the <hi>State,</hi> from some <hi>light within,</hi> which
they insist upon in large discourses of words
hudled together, the meaning whereof
other men cannot comprehend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they meet with this spirit revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
again in the writings of some <hi>modern
Catholicks</hi> within the space of nine and
twenty or thirty years, which had layn
quiet, or much quieter for four or five
hundred years, and scarce a mention of
them in the common Catholick Writers of
those times, it cannot be wondred at, that
men are not willing to give any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48703:119"/>
to those <hi>infusions</hi> which have so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
been discovered to be mere <hi>delusions,</hi> or
that many who have read all <hi>Mother Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>'s
<hi>visions</hi> and <hi>ecstasies,</hi> and accidentally
meet with some <hi>well exercised Quakers,</hi>
are apt to think their stile very like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they comprehend the sence of both
alike; and as it is some argument against
the difficulty of a Book, that it is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into any other Language, than that in
which it is writ; so when it is translated
into very many Languages, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by none, or by very few who are
not suspected for ignorance in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
it is a great discouragement to
<hi>the Reader,</hi> if it be no reproach upon <hi>the
work,</hi> and I believe and hope that it is a
fate <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> will not undergo, by
being translated into as many Languages
as <hi>Mother Teresa</hi> hath been. But it may
be that the objection which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
says, keeps women from being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for witnesses of miracles in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization
of Saints (in which he finds he
was grosly deceived) may be a good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of them for the receiving and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
extraordinary Illuminations and
Revelations. <hi>Naturally</hi> (he says <hi>pag.</hi> 68.)
<hi>imagination is stronger in them than judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and whatsoever is esteemed by them to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48703:120"/>
be pious, is easily concluded by them to be true;</hi>
and I must confess I have found more <hi>Nuns</hi>
and <hi>Religious Persons</hi> who seem perfectly
to understand that <hi>dialect,</hi> than any <hi>other
Catholicks</hi> with whom I have conversed.
I confess I am so unwilling to think light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or speak pleasantly of any expedient
that may possibly in other men advance
devotion, that I am most unwillingly
drawn again into the discourse of it, since
I now find by casting my eye upon a little
Treatise written by a friend of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s,
or by <hi>himself,</hi> to illustrate that subject,
that I am totally incapable of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; for though Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> confesses that
<hi>many persons even in the Catholick Church
have been seduced by the Devil and their
own pride, to pretend to lights received from
God, which were either the effects of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
fancy, or suggestions of the Devil,</hi>
which his friend likewise acknowledges,
and seems prepared to give advice how the
one shall be discovered and distinguished
from the other, in which I would have
been very glad to be instructed, but am
utterly disappointed by the first conditions
that he establishes towards the discovery,
which is, <hi>That the persons who pretend to
Visions and Illuminations must necessarily be
Roman Catholicks,</hi> because he lays it a
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48703:120"/>
ground indisputable, that <hi>all pretences and
appearances of that kind in any persons of a
different Faith, are infallibly Diabolical;</hi>
which is so full a contradiction to the right
of another sort of Enthusiafts, who to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men seem to make their claim with <hi>as
much reason,</hi> and think that every instance
that is urged out of the Scripture by this
<hi>new Author</hi> of all the <hi>infusions,</hi> and <hi>visions,</hi>
and <hi>illuminations,</hi> and <hi>revelations</hi> from the
Creation to the end of the Revelation, may
be as well applied to <hi>their justification;</hi> as
for that of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be no farther engaged in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
but for ever take my leave of
it.</p>
            <p>I am confident the Doctor is so willing
to gratifie Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> that he will deny
him nothing that is reasonable; but it is
not a just request, when himself hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in his Book that he will not examine
one quotation which the Doctor hath with
notable industry and punctuality set down
to prove all he hath averred; and that it
concerns not him whether they be true or
false; he now requests him in his Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
that <hi>he will not hereafter abuse the
world by fathering on the Church the Exotick
opinions of particular School-men,</hi> (it was
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48703:121"/>
his part to have shewed what School-men,
and what opinions the Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected)
<hi>and by representing the Churches
Doctrines lamely, falsly and dishonestly,</hi>
which he says, is <hi>his enormous faultiness
committed in his last Book through every one
of the points mentioned by him, which,</hi> he
says, <hi>may be visible to all heedful Readers;</hi>
truly the more shame for him, that would
not have that advantage against him,
when he was without any other, but he
says, <hi>irrefragable proofs are making ready of
this, if the Searchers would be quiet,</hi> and
let the Printers work; but it is an even
lay the want of that discovery will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
laid upon the <hi>Searchers,</hi> though
they cannot prevent the coming out of any
thing else they have a mind to publish.
And it may seem strange after his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his Book, that all is required in and
by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> and <hi>Book of
Common-Prayer</hi> well known, and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
he would have it thought in his Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
that they know not where to find
doctrines, for no other doctrines we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and he shall do well to declare by
what authority the <hi>Catholicks of England</hi>
conform themselves to the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi>
that hath never been received in <hi>that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48703:121"/>
Kingdom,</hi> as it hath not been in some <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Countries,</hi> and therefore is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
there; nor must he think he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
this question, by saying that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Countries have received all that
is of the <hi>Essence of Religion,</hi> and reject only
some <hi>Canons</hi> which are <hi>indifferent;</hi> for if
any thing remains indifferent after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Council, and may
therefore be rejected, it is manifest that
the jurisdiction is not in the Council,
though confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> but in that
power that rejects it, and judges of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency.
For his invitation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
to a Christening, that a Colledge in
<hi>Cambridge</hi> may have another name given
to it, than it is now called by S. <hi>Bennet,</hi>
or <hi>Corpus Christi Colledge,</hi> the wit of it is
enough answered, when taken notice of.</p>
            <p>The last Paragraph of his <hi>Postscript</hi> is a
pure piece of <hi>Oratory,</hi> and may be in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of no worse an <hi>Orator</hi> than <hi>Caesar</hi>
himself, who when he had tried all fair
and foul means, threats and promises to
draw <hi>Cicero</hi> to his party, and found it was
impossible to engage him to be active
against <hi>Pompey,</hi> he only considered how
to make him <hi>Neutral,</hi> to sit still without
doing any thing in the quarrel, and writ
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48703:122"/>
to him, <hi>Neque tutius, neque honestius repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
quidquam quàm ab omni contentione
abesse.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> after he hath heaped
more ill words upon the Doctor, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
more reproachful Epithets to his
grave and learned person, and stile, than
hath been gathered together in so small a
volume within these nine and twenty
years; he concludes his Postscript with
<hi>desiring him to consider that Almighty God
commands us to love Peace and Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 8. 19.</note> and
then gravely informs him how they ought
always to go together, and left his too ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
address to him should more work upon
him, than would become an adversary;
he quickens him for the better application
of his Text, by telling him, that <hi>since he
hath demolished all Tribunals in Gods Church,
which might peaceably end controversies, and
had endeavoured as much as in him lay to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
peace eternally from among Christians,
it was expected from him that he should give
some testimony to the world, that he is at least
a seeker, and promoter of truth;</hi> and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
very Rhetorically to perswade him
that he doth not himself believe any thing
that he says to others, because he is too
reasonable a man, and of too great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to think that <hi>such a Book as his last can
convert any Catholick, who cannot read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48703:122"/>
trembling at the blasphemy of it, and
without a horrible aversion from one, who
would make their Church and their Faith odious.</hi>
Indeed I believe they will suffer very
few of their Proselytes to read that or any
other of his Books, which may open their
eyes, or inform them of the darkness they
are in. If Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s word may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as no doubt it will, he will tell them
of <hi>blasphemies</hi> that may make them
<hi>tremble,</hi> though he hath not in his whole
answer named one; but if a man will not
(that is, cannot) give credit to all the
stories which are told of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> and
S. <hi>Francis,</hi> he is streight a <hi>blasphemer of
Gods Saints,</hi> as he who will not submit to
the authority of the <hi>Bishop of Rome, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
all Tribunals in Gods Church, which
might peaceably end controversies, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to banish peace eternally from amongst
Christians,</hi> whereas it is only <hi>that Tribunal</hi>
that hinders and obstructs the <hi>peace,</hi>
which, but for <hi>that judicatory,</hi> would be
generally imbraced.</p>
            <p>The counsel I would now give to
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will consist in two kinds, the
first with reference to <hi>himself</hi> purely, the
second with reference to the <hi>cause:</hi> If he
thinks fit any more to write against the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48703:123"/>
               <hi>Church of England,</hi> which I do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from, that he will state truly
and clearly the difference between it and
the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which he hath never
yet done. I advise him to remember that
he hath been a <hi>member</hi> and <hi>son</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> cherished and educated
in her, during the most vigorous part of
his age, and that he ows to that education
all the learning he hath; I will charitably
believe that he saw, or thought he saw
good reason to withdraw himself from <hi>her
Communion,</hi> and that he is satisfied in his
conscience, with his present state of <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
let it be so; why should that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from living fairly and civilly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her? It is an ungenerous thing to
fall from <hi>streight embraces</hi> to <hi>publick revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
Men of honour after they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
friendships with each other for a
long time, and afterwards find cause from
some mutation in manners, and upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of infirmities with which they can
no longer comply, to live at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
towards each other, to repose less
confidence than they used to do, and by
degrees to grow strangers; they yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
such a <hi>decent behaviour,</hi> that standers
by can scarce discover any alteration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in them; they are never heard
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48703:123"/>
to speak ill, to traduce, or disgrace one
another, and believe that it is a debt and
duty due to their former friendship never
to undervalue each others parts, or to
bring the honour of either into question;
common prudence, and good breeding
prevents those excesses; and methinks
in <hi>Religion</hi> the same temper should have
a greater influence, and Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> should
for his own sake allow some beauty to have
been in the Church that did so long detain
him, and not desire to render her so ugly
and deformed, as takes away any excuse
from any body for staying so long in her
company. This I expected from his <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
genius,</hi> and from the <hi>conversation he
frequented,</hi> where bitterness of words was
never allowable towards men whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
were very different; and if any new
illumination hath perswaded him that
such urbanity is not consistent with the
zeal that Religious discourses should be
warmed with, he should suspect it for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion.
He hath an excellent example gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, by a <hi>Catholick learned</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Bishop,</hi> the present <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Prince
of Condun,</hi> who treats an enemy more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to him, and more liable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
than the <hi>Church of England</hi> can be
imagined to be to Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> with such
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48703:124"/>
condescension and humanity, as if they
stood upon the same level with him. And
no question <hi>those strokes</hi> make a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon all ingenuous men, than
<hi>louder blows,</hi> and are with more difficulty
repelled. Whereas Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> like a rude
and blustering wind, disturbs all sorts of
men who stand near him, offends and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
all <hi>Classes</hi> of men with his unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
choler. What can the <hi>King</hi> think to
see his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> so vilified
by his scornful expressions, to hear his
<hi>Royal Ancestor,</hi> whose obsequies were
kept and observed at <hi>Nostre Dame in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
with the highest solemnity by the first
great King <hi>France</hi> ever had, in spight of
the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Excommunication,</hi> called a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
by one of his own <hi>subjects?</hi> What can
all the <hi>Protestant Nobility</hi> and <hi>Prelates of
England</hi> think to see the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and
<hi>Civil Laws</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and trampled upon by a man who
could not live an hour in that Air but by
the <hi>Kings mercy?</hi> What must all the
peaceable and well-affected <hi>Catholicks of
England</hi> think, who have enjoyed so long
tranquillity by the King's grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to find the calm they were in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the boisterous and unskilful
noise of one of their <hi>own Preachers,</hi> and to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48703:124"/>
hear and see a jealousie kindled of their
loyalty and good meaning, by the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
breath of a <hi>Religious man,</hi> that if it
be not allayed by their prudence, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and destroy their chief and most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
habitations. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> therefore shall
do well and wisely henceforward to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
himself with more temper and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
towards the Church, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, of whose clemency and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he may yet stand in need; and if his
<hi>passion</hi> will not suffer him to live as a
<hi>Friend,</hi> let his <hi>discretion</hi> prevail with him
to live like a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> at least like an <hi>old
acquaintance,</hi> as long as he thinks it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to enjoy the benefit of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>The advice that I give Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> with
reference to the <hi>matter</hi> is, That he will
contract the Controversie into what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>Church of England</hi> solely, and to
say all he can against the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
thereof, and not to make any <hi>sallies</hi>
against <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
or other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who declare
as great animosity against the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> as that of <hi>Rome</hi> hath always,
and therefore are more like to agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And the first question that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48703:125"/>
and pertinent to be debated, and
which determination will go very far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the reconciling all inferiour parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
is;</p>
            <p>I. Whether a <hi>National Church</hi> hath
power, with the <hi>approbation</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of
the <hi>Soveraign,</hi> to remove any errors or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
which have been practised
in that Church, either by an <hi>Original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
or by <hi>degenerating</hi> from what
might at first be innocent, into <hi>superstition</hi>
or <hi>scandal;</hi> and whether the <hi>long reception</hi>
and <hi>continuance</hi> of what is <hi>erroneous</hi> or
<hi>mischievous,</hi> can restrain the <hi>Soveraign
power</hi> from reforming it, when he finds it
necessary in the same peaceable order and
method, as he provides Laws in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for the <hi>well Government</hi> of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Whether whatsoever is not of the
<hi>Essence of Christian Religion</hi> instituted by
<hi>our Saviour</hi> himself, or declared or advised
to be practised by <hi>the Apostles,</hi> may not
lawfully be looked upon as <hi>Religion of
State,</hi> in that it may be altered, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
or abolished by the <hi>Soveraign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
for the better advancement of those ends
which are essential, and which no power
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48703:125"/>
on Earth can make alteration in? And
whether <hi>Gods promise</hi> to his <hi>Church</hi> be not
to be depended upon in every <hi>National
Church</hi> where learning and piety flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that it shall not fall into enormous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
whereby Christianity shall receive
prejudice, and be not more like to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and propagate devotion in that
Church and Nation, than any <hi>Foreign
power</hi> whatsoever?</p>
            <p>III. Whether the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> hath
any <hi>authority</hi> given by God in the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and over the Subjects of <hi>other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and what authority and power it is,
and what obedience and subjection it is,
which the <hi>English Catholicks</hi> conceive
themselves bound to pay to him by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of their Religion? It being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary for the <hi>personal security</hi> of
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> and for the <hi>peace</hi> and
<hi>quiet of Kingdoms,</hi> that it may be clearly
made manifest, what the <hi>authority</hi> and
<hi>power</hi> is, that a <hi>Foreign Prince</hi> doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
in an <hi>other Princes Dominions</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to and above the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> and
<hi>what obedience</hi> it is that subjects may pay to
such a <hi>Foreign Prince</hi> without the <hi>privity,</hi>
and contrary to the <hi>command</hi> of his <hi>own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,</hi>
nor can any general answer be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48703:126"/>
in this point. They who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Pope</hi> hath a <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
power</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> must explain what
the full intent of that power is, that the
<hi>King</hi> may discern whether he hath enough
of either as to preserve himself &amp; the peace
of the Kingdom; and they who insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his having a <hi>spiritual power</hi> as most of
the most <hi>moderate Catholicks</hi> do, without
imagining that it can in the least lessen
their affection and loyalty to the King,
which they do really intend to preserve
inviolable, must as clearly explain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
what they understand that <hi>spiritual</hi> to
be, which may otherwise be extended as
far as the former intend the <hi>temporal</hi> and
<hi>spiritual</hi> shall extend; nor in truth can
they be secure of their own innocence, of
which they think themselves in possession,
until they fully know from those who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
them with distinctions, what that
<hi>spiritual power</hi> is, and what <hi>submission</hi> they
are bound to pay to it, which seeming to
be some obligation upon their Conscience,
it is fit they may be sure it cannot involve
them in actions contrary to their duties,
which they can hardly be secure of, and
less satisfie others, till they absolutely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
any power to be in him at all with
reference to <hi>England,</hi> as they will upon a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48703:126"/>
full enquiry discover, that he hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in any <hi>Catholick Kingdom,</hi> but what
is granted to him by the <hi>Soveraign power,</hi>
and the <hi>municipal Laws</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi>
which makes it differ so much in all the
<hi>Catholick Nations of Europe,</hi> and to be
little or nothing out of it.</p>
            <p>IV. Whether <hi>Catholick Subjects</hi> in
<hi>England</hi> are not bound to give as <hi>good se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi>
to the King for their fidelity, and
peaceable behaviour, as all his <hi>other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
do, and without which they cannot
wonder that they may be made <hi>subject</hi>
to such <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>restraints,</hi> as may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them from being <hi>dangerous,</hi> when
they profess to owe obedience to a <hi>foreign
Prince,</hi> who doth as much profess not
to be a friend to their Countrey, and
will not declare what that obedience is?</p>
            <p>V. Whether his <hi>Majestie</hi> may not
<hi>justly,</hi> and ought not <hi>prudently</hi> to require
the <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>as full satisfaction</hi> and <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
for their <hi>allegiance,</hi> as <hi>Catholick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
give for their fidelity to <hi>Catholick
Kings;</hi> if so, how can the <hi>English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
under <hi>pretence of Religion</hi> refuse
to declare, that it is in no <hi>Earthly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
to absolve them from their fidelity
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48703:127"/>
to the King, when no <hi>French Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
dares refuse the same, it being a
<hi>Catholick resolution</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the occasion of a seditious Book
by a Declaration of the <hi>Sorbone</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Kings Independency,</hi> in the Year
1663. <hi>Quòd subditi fidem, &amp; obedientiam
Regi Christianissimo ita debent, ut ab iis
nullo praetextu dispensari possint;</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any <hi>Catholick</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi>
can refuse to profess that he doth not
believe that the <hi>Pope</hi> can depose the
King, if the King thinks to require
it?</p>
            <p>VI. Whether since the <hi>Pope</hi> so lately
caused his <hi>Majestie's Catholick Subjects
in Ireland</hi> to rebell, and when out of the
conscience of their sin they submitted to
the King, and subscribed, and swore to
the observation of the Articles agreed
upon; The <hi>Pope absolved them</hi> from the
performance of their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself to be their <hi>General</hi> in the
Person of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and assumed the
exercise of the <hi>Regal power</hi> both at <hi>Land</hi>
and <hi>Sea,</hi> and imprisoned those <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
and threatned to take their Lives who
had promoted the peace, and desired to
return to the <hi>King's Subjection;</hi> And
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48703:127"/>
when since the Kings <hi>happy Restoration,</hi>
the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Catholick Clergie of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
thought it necessary to present
some Testimony of their <hi>future Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
to the King, in which they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the <hi>Pope</hi> had no power to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence</hi>
with their fidelity to his Majesty,
or to <hi>absolve</hi> them from any <hi>Oaths</hi> they
should take to that purpose, which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
was attested, and subscribed
by many of the principal <hi>Catholick Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
and others of the <hi>best quality,</hi> and
<hi>interest,</hi> as likewise by some of their <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular
Catholick Bishops,</hi> and many of their
<hi>Secular,</hi> and <hi>Regular Clergie;</hi> But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
and notice hereof being sent to
<hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> was so offended at it,
that he caused his <hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> to
command some of the Clergy who had
subscribed that Paper to attend him, and
threatned to excommunicate them, and
<hi>Cardinal Barbaryne</hi> at the same time, writ
a Letter to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Clergie of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in which he signified how much
the <hi>Pope</hi> was displeased that such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and declaration had been made,
and commanded them to discountenance,
and suppress the same, and take care that
it should proceed no farther, and the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
added, <hi>That they should remember
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48703:128"/>
what they well knew, that the Kingdom
remained still under Excommunication?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the case, it cannot but be
very necessary that his Majesty should
know what opinion his <hi>Catholick Subjects</hi>
have of this <hi>Foreign power,</hi> which will
observe no limits, but of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and will concern all <hi>Roman
English Subjects</hi> to explain their sence of
it, that they may not be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
only the protection of those Laws,
which gives them equal title to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
all <hi>other Subjects</hi> enjoy, and to be
willing to be dispenced with for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all those <hi>obligations</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Subjects are under; and in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whereof the other benefits are
granted to them.</p>
            <p>VII. Whether the <hi>English Catholick
Subjects</hi> are not bound in Conscience to
submit to the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> in all
things which are not against the <hi>Law of
God,</hi> and <hi>who</hi> is to be <hi>judge</hi> whether they
are against the <hi>Law of God</hi> or no, and if
Men are forbid to keep Company, or to
have conversation with dissolute, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Persons, how they can justifie the
living in continual company with, and in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48703:128"/>
constant profession of friendship to those,
who they conceive, and believe to be
out of a possibility of Salvation; and for
which (if in truth they do believe it) the
saying, they may believe as well as hope
that they will repent, and become Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
before they dye, when, whatever
they may hope, they do not in truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they will ever change their
Religion, so that it is more reasonable
to believe from the learning, reason, and
judgment of many <hi>Catholicks,</hi> that they
do not believe it, whatever they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to say, or rather whatever others
say to them, and whether <hi>Protestants</hi>
who do think that the <hi>Papists</hi> do really
believe they must be damned, are not
very excusable, if they avoid, and decline
any commerce, or conversation with
them, even to the abstaining from buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or selling with them, or from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
any <hi>Servant of that Religion,</hi> since
it cannot reasonably be presumed that a
<hi>Servant</hi> can love a <hi>Master,</hi> which it is
his duty to do, who he doth believe will
<hi>infallibly be damned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. How Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> and the rest
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48703:129"/>
who have received <hi>Orders</hi> in <hi>the Church
of England,</hi> can justifie, or excuse their
being <hi>re-ordained</hi> after they change their
<hi>Religion,</hi> since so many <hi>Councils</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
against it, and no one for it, and
since the <hi>succession of Bishops</hi> is as plainly
manifest in <hi>one Church</hi> as in <hi>the other,</hi> and
in truth may be more doubted upon their
own grounds in the <hi>Roman,</hi> from the
<hi>number</hi> of <hi>Schismes,</hi> and the <hi>continuance</hi>
of them, in which so many <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Persons</hi> have been consecrated <hi>Bishops,</hi>
and they again ordained <hi>Priests</hi> under the
same condemnation, which may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have made a great confusion, by
many Mens having conferred <hi>Orders,</hi> who
(by their Rules, I say) were <hi>Laymen</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
However, what difference can
there be assigned, why such of the <hi>Greek
Church</hi> who come to them, are not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained,</hi>
but those of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
are compelled to be?</p>
            <p>IX. Whether St. <hi>Peter</hi> exercised any
jurisdiction, or assumed any superiority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the rest of the Apostles, during the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Years</hi> he remained at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as he
ought to have done, if the <hi>Supremacy</hi> was
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48703:129"/>
annexed to his <hi>Person,</hi> or in the <hi>Four and
twenty Years</hi> he reigned in <hi>Rome,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the contrary be not manifest by St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> not so
much by the Contest that was between
<hi>him,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> about <hi>Circumcision</hi> even
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in St. <hi>Peter's</hi> own <hi>Diocess,</hi>
where <hi>St. Paul withstood him to his face,
because he was to be blamed,</hi> which is poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered by those who say, it was
in the warmth of disputation, when all
men contradict each other, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of quality or degree; But I say
I do not urge the equality so much by that
<hi>contradiction</hi> (though it be not answered)
as by the <hi>matter, occasion,</hi> and <hi>substance</hi> of
that <hi>Epistle,</hi> which seems to be written
principally upon that Subject: St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had converted that People, the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
from <hi>Paganisme,</hi> to the <hi>Faith of Christ,</hi>
and he was no sooner gone from them to
another place, but some other Christians
(for there was no attempt to reduce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to <hi>Paganisme</hi>) were inclined to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
with Scruples, that they were not
throughly informed of the whole faith
that was necessary, nor by one who had
ever seen our Saviour, and so was not
like to be himself informed as well as
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48703:130"/>
they, especially when St. <hi>Peter</hi> preached
contrary to what the other taught, so
that the weight of what was objected
by those, whoever they were, was the
incompetency of the Person who had
taught them, in comparison of the other,
and particularly of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> So that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> could not at this time have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of that <hi>Supremacy,</hi> if there had been
any, <hi>this Epistle</hi> being written above <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
Years</hi> after his <hi>conversion,</hi> nor could
he have avoided the mentioning of it
upon this argument, if he had known it,
especially since he writ that Letter from
<hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> at the same time was,
nor could he more clearly have confuted
that Opinion than he hath done, except
he had believed St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself to have
affected it, which he had no reason to do,
since he knew who they were who had
infused those suggestions; He gives them
a short accompt of his own <hi>Apostleship,</hi>
and how he had spent his time since, of
his first Journey to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet that
he went not thither till <hi>three Years</hi> after
his <hi>conversion,</hi> and till after he performed
many acts of his <hi>Apostleship,</hi> in which he
received no direction from any; Of his
<hi>Second Iourney</hi> afterwards to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48703:130"/>
which he takes care that they might not
think that he had <hi>any Superiour</hi> there, <hi>To
whom we gave place by subjection, no not
for an hour;</hi> He proceeds then in the same
jealousie to make a comparison with St.
<hi>Peter; He that wrought effectually in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to the Apostleship of the Circumcision,
the same was mighty in me towards the
Gentiles; effectually</hi> in <hi>Peter, mighty</hi> in
<hi>Paul,</hi> a word of an equal energy: and
lest all this might be looked upon as
speaking <hi>behind his back,</hi> after he had
mentioned the respect he had received
from the other <hi>Apostles,</hi> from <hi>Iames,</hi> and
<hi>Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> he tells them, that
when <hi>Peter</hi> came to him, <hi>he withstood
him to the face because he was to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
and the manner of his expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with him seems very rough, as
with a man that stood upon the <hi>same
level</hi> with him, not as with the <hi>sole
Vicar of Christ; If thou being a Iew li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
after the manner of the Gentiles,
and not as do the Iews, why compellest
thou the Gentiles to live as do the Iews?</hi>
Whosoever seriously reflects upon the
tampering that had been with the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians</hi>
to lessen their confidence in <hi>Paul,</hi>
and the gradations by which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48703:131"/>
to reconfirm them in the same
faith he had formerly taught them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but believe that the <hi>Apostle</hi> had
therein a purpose to root out any such
Opinion of <hi>priority</hi> out of their hearts,
especially when in no other place after
this there appears the least mention of,
or appeal to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and mis-interpretations of the
words and actions of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and
of them in the Life of the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
from whence many troubles, and great
disorders sprung and grew up amongst
Christians of that Age.</p>
            <p>He shall do well to consider, whether
it be probable that St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself,
or any of his Successors did pretend a
Precedency, or Superiority over Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> who lived <hi>Twenty
Years</hi> after Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and to let us
know when the <hi>first Pope</hi> discovered
his <hi>Supremacy</hi> over other <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
then we know well enough how it was
introduced in <hi>Temporalities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:48703:131"/>
If Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and the rest of the <hi>enemies</hi>
of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any members of the same to have any
hope, without deserting their Mother, of
a place in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and hardly admit them
to be in their wits upon <hi>Earth,</hi> would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon the disquisition of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which are warily declined in all their
Writings, or very perfunctorily handled,
the <hi>foundation, doctrine</hi> and <hi>discipline</hi> of
that Church, would be in a short time ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
overthrown and demolished, or
worthily vindicated and supported in the
judgment of most learned and discerning
men; and there can be but two reasons
why they should decline this method,
which they should the rather imbrace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all other have proved ineffectual,
and in near two hundred years, the <hi>appeal
to Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> or <hi>Scripture</hi> it
self, hath not reconciled many persons in
any one controverted particular, but those
two reasons, so unwarrantable that they
will never be owned, will never suffer
them to admit the method, and pursue it
closely. The first is, that if they should
proceed in this ingenuous and substantial
way, they would be cut off from those
common places in which they are only
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48703:132"/>
versed, and by which they are supplied
to urge all things which have been
thought heretofore material to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to reply to what is said of course,
but especially they will find themselves
restrained from that multitude of ill words
in which they so much delight of calling
those they do not love, and whose argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they cannot answer, <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who
are condemned already to <hi>Hell-fire,</hi> and
from asking the old stale question, that
hath been as often answered as asked,
<hi>Where was your Church before Luther,</hi> and
from their so often vain excursions upon
the voluptuousness of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi>
whom they would fain perswade the
world to be the <hi>Founder</hi> of the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> and all the <hi>reformation</hi> to have
been devised by <hi>him.</hi> Whereas if they
would seriously study these material
points, <hi>the first</hi> whereof would go very far
towards the facilitating the resolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>the rest,</hi> they might easily discern, that
no <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> by
their own rules can be comprehended
within any of their decrees for an <hi>Heretick,</hi>
which serves their turn only as an angry
word to throw at any mans head, whom
they desire to make odious to all <hi>Roman
Catholicks;</hi> and they would be as easily
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48703:132"/>
convinced, that we never had any thing
to do with <hi>Luther;</hi> that in all those quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and wars, which were either occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by him, or accompanied his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
there was not a man of the <hi>English
Nation</hi> that was ever engaged, and that
it was long after <hi>his time,</hi> &amp; not at all by <hi>his
model</hi> that the <hi>Church of England</hi> without
one sword drawn, and in as peaceable
and grave a manner, as ever that Nation
hath concurred in the making of any of
those excellent Laws, which distinguishes
them from all the subjects of the world, in
the happiness they enjoy, did reject those
superstitions and inconveniences, which
they could not sooner free themselves from
with those circumstances of justice and
peace, and the retaining whereof would
have been more for the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> than for the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> or the <hi>good</hi> of that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
and as such alterations cannot be
supposed to be made with so <hi>universal a
consent,</hi> but that many of all conditions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
still to the exercise of <hi>their Religion,</hi>
with all the circumstances which they had
been before accustomed unto, and for
which no body suffered in many years,
nor till by their treasonable acts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
they appeared dangerous to the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48703:133"/>
State: For <hi>King Henry the Eighth</hi> he had
some personal contests with <hi>Clement the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi>
who was then <hi>Pope,</hi> from whom
he received such <hi>personal indignities,</hi> as in
the opinion of most of the Princes of that
Age, who had all out-grown the <hi>wardship</hi>
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he could not but resent and
vindicate himself from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor did he do it
any other way, than his most glorious <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Predecessors</hi> had always done upon
far less injuries or provocations, as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the First</hi> and <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> and
others whose Religion was never suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
often restrained him from exercising
any authority or jurisdiction in <hi>England,</hi>
to which they well knew he had no other
<hi>authority</hi> or <hi>right,</hi> but what the <hi>Crown</hi> had
granted him, and forbid any of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to repair to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to receive any
<hi>Orders</hi> from thence, which was upon the
matter all that <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi> did, and
was no more than <hi>Lewis the Twelfth</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> had done very few years before,
but was so far from being inclined or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to any <hi>reformation</hi> or <hi>alteration</hi> in
<hi>Religion,</hi> that he proceeded as long as he
lived with the utmost severity against all
who were but suspected to be averse from
the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and caused many of
them to be burned as <hi>Hereticks</hi> very few
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48703:133"/>
days before, having made new Laws for
the discovery of them stricter than had
been ever before. And there is no reason
to believe that he did not die as much a
<hi>Catholick</hi> as he was when he writ against
<hi>Luther;</hi> nor did any <hi>Catholick Prince</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to enter into the strictest alliance with
him, notwithstanding the <hi>Popes Bulls</hi> of
<hi>Excommunication, Deprivation,</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi>
nor was there one <hi>Mass</hi> the less
said for it in <hi>England;</hi> and after his death
<hi>his obsequies</hi> were with all possible solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
observed (as hath been said before) in
<hi>Paris at Nostre Dame,</hi> by <hi>Francis the First,</hi>
notwithstanding all those <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi>
in all which nothing can be more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
than that the great Emperor <hi>Charles
the Fifth,</hi> who had threatned and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that weak humorous <hi>Pope</hi> into all those
acts of folly and presumption against the
King, had no sooner made him commit
that insolence, but himself entred into a
straiter <hi>friendship</hi> and <hi>confederacy</hi> with
the <hi>Excommunicated King,</hi> than had ever
before been between them.</p>
            <p>The other reason why they will very
unwillingly expose their interest to this
manner of debate is, That it would <hi>divide
their party,</hi> which if they were solicitous
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48703:134"/>
only for truth would not prevail with
them. Other <hi>Catholick Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which differ from one another, as
well in the <hi>profession</hi> as the <hi>exercise</hi> of the
<hi>Roman Religion,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> hold a
<hi>Council</hi> to be above the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
the <hi>Pope</hi> to be above a <hi>Council,</hi> and
many other particulars; when they come
to know that the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have established only amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such an exercise of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
that in all the substantial and essential
points is the same which they profess,
without censuring them, or what they
find fit to do in <hi>their Countries,.</hi> and have
only made <hi>such alterations</hi> as by the <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> they may lawfully
do, and which they find more agreeable
to the <hi>manners of the Nation,</hi> and for the
<hi>peace</hi> and <hi>happiness of the people.</hi> They
will not think themselves concerned in
the <hi>policy</hi> of <hi>other Kingdoms,</hi> nor the <hi>Popes
authority</hi> so much of the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Catholick
Religion,</hi> that they are bound to support all
<hi>his pretences</hi> which are different in all
those Countries which are most devoted
to him, and therefore cannot flow from
any <hi>determination</hi> of our Saviour, which
would have made it <hi>the same</hi> in <hi>all places;</hi>
besides, they too well know, that in all the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48703:134"/>
particulars proposed, the <hi>Catholick Doctors</hi>
are not of <hi>one mind,</hi> who are now kept
united to them by not knowing the <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> nor that
the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in that Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to give that <hi>security</hi> for their <hi>duty</hi> to
the <hi>King,</hi> and for their <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>good
behaviour,</hi> as all other their <hi>fellow subjects</hi>
chearfully give, and as are required of all
by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and if they
would perform that common duty, it is
very probable that there appearing no
more danger to threaten the State, from
them, than from other men, those Laws
which the iniquity of <hi>their forefathers</hi>
brought upon them by their <hi>conspiracies</hi>
and <hi>treasons</hi> may be <hi>suspended</hi> towards their
<hi>innocent Children,</hi> until such time as their
<hi>peaceable demeanour</hi> and <hi>good carriage</hi> shall
make it appear just to be <hi>abolished.</hi> This
expedient for the reasons aforesaid, will
be obstructed by the <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>regular
Clergie,</hi> who have so absolute a <hi>dependence</hi>
upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> that they are in truth <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
to no <hi>other Prince;</hi> and probably
some few of the <hi>secular Clergie</hi> may concur
with them, though <hi>more of them,</hi> if they
can discern any security to themselves in
<hi>disclaiming</hi> the <hi>Popes authority,</hi> which few
of them look upon, as of the <hi>Essence</hi> of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48703:135"/>
their <hi>Religion,</hi> and have in their hearts
as well as in their professions as sincere
purposes towards the King and his People.
However I know not why all the <hi>Lay Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
of his <hi>Majesties Dominions</hi> should
bind up <hi>their interest,</hi> with those who
have <hi>different obligations</hi> from them, nor
how they can excuse themselves from not
throughly examining every one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
heads proposed, by which they
will receive this benefit and information,
that they will clearly discern what is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
for them to <hi>retain</hi> and <hi>insist upon,</hi>
without which in their conscience (as
thus informed) they cannot continue
<hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and what
is so much of the <hi>policy of the State,</hi> that is
warrantable or unwarrantable, only as it
is established by the <hi>Soveraign authority,</hi>
and by this means they will know how to
give unto <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is <hi>Caesar's,</hi>
and to render unto <hi>God</hi> that which belongs
unto <hi>God;</hi> the just distribution whereof
is of an equal concernment to all <hi>Christians,</hi>
being equally enjoyned by our <hi>Saviour
Christ.</hi>
