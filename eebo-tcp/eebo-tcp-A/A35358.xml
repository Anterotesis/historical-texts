            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right VVorshipfull, Sir William
Culpeper Knight and Baronet,
Nicholas Culpeper wisheth Health, Wealth,
and Peace, in this World, and a
Crown of Glory in that to come.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEfore I proceed farther, let me crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of your Worship, for these my bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in presuming to Dedicate these my
weak Labours to your Worship, to whom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of place hath now almost made a
stranger; but considering that Ingenuity of Spirit that was
once in your Father, &amp; flourisheth in you who are the Branch
of so Noble a Root, together with the antient Familiarity that
was between your Father and mine, imboldned me after I
had converted a few idle hours into Study, and having
brought forth to birth what then I conceived, I present it
at your Worships feet: I hope there is nothing in it unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
the name of <hi>Culpeper;</hi> if there be failings in it they
are no more then what we are all subject to. The Ingenuity
of your Worship, I know to be such, that you will not onely
passe by my boldness in dedicating it to you, for that Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Alliance in blood may take off,
<q>
                  <l>Sigenus amborum scindit se sanguine ab uno.</l>
               </q>
Besides, as your ingenuity is <hi>Operative,</hi> which the Bowels of
all your poore Neighbours daily blesse God for, which you
are commended for, even where you are not known, and is
<pb facs="tcp:54723:3"/>
is no small joy to mine (your poore Kinsmans) heart, so shall
you be eternally rewarded for it another day, <hi>blessed is he
that remembreth the poor,</hi> your Worship knows well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
what follows. I hope your Worship will expect no
Flattery in the Epistle, there being none in the booke: if
you accept the Book, I shall thinke my selfe happy, and I am
confident those of our blood will hardly degenerate; it was
a notable expression of <hi>Plato, O Knowledge, how would
men love thee, if they did but know thee! for as Health
is the conservation of the Body, so is knowledge the
conservation of the Soul.</hi> Though it hath been neer upon
fifteen years since I saw your Worship: yet have I often
heard of you, both by Master <hi>Thomas Culpeper</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Whitfield,</hi> who are both of our kindred, as by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more, and I heare your vertues increase daily more and
more, the Lord encrease them till the time of your change
come: and though we live in such an Age which calleth
Good Evill, and Evill Good, which takes Vice for Vertue
and Vertue for Vice, which think they strike at the Devill
and hit God, yet your Worship knows as well as I can tell
you, &amp; better too, being no stranger to the writings of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi>
what <hi>Plato</hi> said of Vertue and Vice: quoth he,
<hi>If Vertue could take a bodily shape, shee would be so
beautifull a creature, all men would be in love with her,</hi>
(of which your Worship is one) also <hi>if Vice could take a
bodily shape, shee would be such an Ugly beast, all
men would hate her: for if Drunkards have so many
Apish and beastly postures, what would Drunkennesse
it selfe have if it were Visible?</hi> and yet that is but an Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of Vice neither.</p>
            <p>I know very well, and my <hi>Genius</hi> prompts me to it, what
an excellent love your Worship beares to Learning, &amp; truly
I might make another reason of that for Dedicating these
<pb facs="tcp:54723:3"/>
my weak labours to your Worship, as knowing the brightnes
of your brain will dissipate the clouds of my Ignorance: the
truth is, there arose a Question within my selfe whether I
should dedicate it to your Worship or not, but that contest
held not long, for I doubted not of your favourable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for I knew well enough what failed on my part in
the performance of the worke, or what other imperfections
you could find in the booke, should be most Nobly censured,
and like your selfe: then presently I proceeded, and stampt
your Worships name upon it, that it may be said, in despight
of the proudest carper in the world, it is the Godchild of a
peerlesse Godfather. Sir, one thing more I must intreat you,
for I doubt I have been so bold, your VVorship will thinke
I flatter, and that I know your VVorship hates, as well as
my selfe; if there happen any thing in the booke, which
your VVorship cannot understand, I know you will say as
noble-minded <hi>Chion</hi> did, <hi>Let my betters judge of these
matters.</hi> I must confesse the thing is a worke of worth if
well understood, else your VVorship had not had it presented
to you, your worship knowes very well, and far better then
I can tell you, that knowledge requires the whole circuit of
a mans life, even from the <hi>terminus à quo</hi> to the <hi>terminus
ad quem;</hi> and the longer a man lives the more he may
learne. I am briefe, for tis brevity your VVorship delights
in, therefore to use many words I account it needlesse: your
VVorships friendly acceptance of it shall be such a favour
to me as I shall never forget (indeed I have so much the
blood of <hi>Culpeper</hi> in me that I cannot) what such as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unlearned or proudly learned, speak against, I shall
take to be a badge of a weake, or stubborn braine, rather
than any blemish at all to the worke. I know your worship
will judge like your selfe, to whom I make bold to present
this as a memoriall of those former favours not unknowne
<pb facs="tcp:54723:4"/>
to your worship which passed between your Father and
mine; Lastly, before I conclude let me intreat one favour of
your worship, if I have mistaken in, or robbed you of any of
your titles of honour, I beseech you pardon</p>

                  <p>What an Eclipse is.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AN Eclipse is properly the deficiency of light
in a Star, if it be defined in a critical
sence: and although any Star upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick
may suffer an Eclipse, when they
are diametrically opposed to the Sun;
and although a part of the body of the
Sun may be Eclipsed by <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
in an inferiour conjunction, when
they have no latitude (and for ought I know, it carries significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too, though little heeded) yet if we reason of an Eclipse in a
vulgar sence, take the Philosophical description of it thus.</p>
               <p>An Eclipse, is the prohibition of the light either of the Sun or
Moon from our eye.</p>
               <p>And as it is necessary, before we reason of an Eclipse, to tell you
what an Eclipse is; so it is as necessary, to tell you what the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
Eclipsed are; and to what intent the eternal, and only wise
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54723:5"/>
God, placed them in the heavens: and that this may be done me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically,
I will tell you
<list>
                     <item>1. What the Sun is.</item>
                     <item>2. What an Eclipse of the Sun is.</item>
                     <item>3. What the Moon is.</item>
                     <item>4. What an Eclipse of the Moon is.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, know this, that the Sun is the light and governor of the
world; a creature which gives life, light, and motion to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
by moving about his own body upon his Axis, he moves
the whole creation: by him is time limited; by him the Planets
become Oriental, and Occidental: he hides them, and he gives
them their lustre: whatsoever in the creation hath motion (and
there are but few things without it, if any) they have it all from
the Sun: in a word, he is the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of the creation; it
is he that makes the Trees to spring, and the Birds to sing, and
brings forth the fruits of the earth in due season; he quickens and
enlivens all things; and every signe is exalted above its fellows,
when he is in it: he adds life, and light, and strength, and heat
and vertue, to the earth; and therefore his Eclipse is the more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
to it: he is indeed the life of the creation, perhaps <hi>anima
mundi:</hi> when the Sun leaves a signe, that signe remaines like a
dead body without a spirit and motion; and other signes avoyd
that signe, as a living body avoyds a dead body: it is the Sun
that causeth the motions of winde, inundation of water; the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
in the creation, is caused by the Sun: it is he that draws
the waters out of the sea, and returns them upon the earth, that
so it may bring forth fruit in due season, the truth is he is a great
and famous Planet, of mighty power, nobility, magnanimity, and
command; and yet not like the Commanders of our times; for
he loves not mony. His corporal Conjunction, infortunates more
then the conjunction of any Planet; but his Trine, and Sextile
Aspects, fortunate more then the Trines and Sextiles of any
Planet: And if you will know the reason why his Conjunction is
so unfortunate, he gives to all the Planets their light and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and when they are with his body, he takes it away againe.
Life and death, principalities and powers, vanquishing and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
are known by the Sun: <hi>beware his Eclipse upon his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54723:5"/>
As he is in the heavens, so are Magistrates in a
Commonwealth: if the one be afflicted, why may not the
other? the motion of the Sun is natural; the motion of
terrestrial creatures, artificial: when Nature suffers, beware
Art. In the body of man, he represents the head, because
he is exalted in <hi>Aries:</hi> mock not, if you finde him represent the
same in a Nation. All Kings, <hi>quatenus</hi> Kings, are represented by
the Sun; do not admire if they be Eclipsed: the truth of it is, he
is Lord <hi>Paramount</hi> in the creation; and to prove this, I will
send you to school, whither <hi>Iob</hi> sent his companions, <hi>Iob</hi> 12. 7,
8. <hi>Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
fowles of the aire; and they shall tell thee: or speak to the earth,
and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare
to thee.</hi> To which I might add, <hi>The trees themselves will
do it; the birds in the spring declare it to the whole Nation,</hi>
(I wish I could call it a Commonwealth.) The mines in the earth,
yea the flint-stones, will tell you what the power of the Sun is; and
yet he is Eclipsed: we will not deny the influences of the other
Planets together with that Sun; for as the stomach first concocts
the meat, and sends, or should send, the chyle well concocted to
the Liver; and the Liver having concocted it againe, nourisheth
the body by the Veines, and every Veine receives a part of the
blood from the Liver, according to its own capacity, even so the
Sun administers of his own power, to the rest of the Planets, and
to the earth it self: every one receives its part according to its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity:
an Apple-tree bears an Apple; a Crab-tree but a Crab,

I come now to shew you, what an Eclipse of the Sun is: but
before we come to that, take an Aphorisme or two.</p>
               <p>1. An Eclipse is either total, or partial.</p>
               <p>2. A totall Eclipse is, when the whole Star is darkened; a
partial Eclipse is, when but part of the Star is darkened.</p>
               <p>3. No Eclipse can happen but at or neer one of the Nodes, the
Head or taile of the Dragon: if I had been minded to have
frighted the multitude with uncouth words, I would have said,
Anabibazon, and Catabibazon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54723:6"/>4. The Sun, seeing he is the Author of light, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the light
of the world proceeds from him, it is imposs<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> should be
darkened really; but only his beams are hindered by the body of
the Moon, from some particular place of the earth: nay, it is
impossible the Sun should be darkened every where in the same
Hemisphear: it is not <hi>universaliter,</hi> but <hi>secundum quid:</hi> for
the Moon being made of the same metal the earth is (namely, a
lump of dirt rolled up together, and by an All-powerful God
hung in the Aire, the foundations of it fixed upon nothing) the
opacous body of the Moon, takes away the light of the Sun
from some particular people; whereas, by reason of the different
Paralax of the Moon, other Nations in the same Hemisphear can
behold the body of the Sun, not in the least darkned. From
these things thus joyned together, take this definition of an Eclipse
of the Sun.</p>
               <p>An Eclipse of the Sun, is a taking away both light and vertue
of the Sun from a particular people, by the interposition of the
body of the Moon.</p>
               <p>And if so, who, but Doctor SELF, and Doctor CONCEIT
knowing, as I told you before, wherefore God Created the Sun can
deny but that dismal effects must follow the interposition between
a Nation and such a real, such an all-friend. A word is enough to
a wise man.</p>
               <p>In the third place, I come to tell you wherefore the Moon was
created; and though she be but a lump of dirt, she was not created
for nothing; had she been so, man had been created for less. She
is called in the Scripture, a great light, who, as <hi>Iehovah Elohim</hi>
saith, was made to RULE, as well the Sun: and because she was
to rule the night, she cannot be Eclipsed but in the night.</p>
               <p>I wonder in my heart, what the Priests would say, if a man
should ask them the question, What rule the Moon hath in the
night? Or whether a prohibition of light, be not a prohibition of
rule? Or whether a prohibition of rule bring not confusion? Or
whether the corruption of one thing, be not the generation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Haply my argument may appear to be truth ere long and
they may feel it to their cost: when God sets them to rule, and they
deprive one another of their power, <hi>caveant mortales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54723:7"/>Well, but what effects was the Moon created for? that is the
question, and to that now turn I. She is the lesser Luminary;
she is the Governess of the world: she changes all bodies, and
causeth vicissitude of times: pray God the effects of this Eclipse
turn them to the best.</p>
               <p>Yet this I will say by the rules of natural Philosophy, All things
between the <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> and the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> require
order and good method; and according as the method is in the
<hi>medium,</hi> so shall the end prove.</p>
               <p>If the new River-water had been brought from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
in lead, it had come clear; but being brought in earth, it
is muddy. I will leave this Nation to pick English out
of it.</p>
               <p>The Moon, about which our discourse is, is most appropriated
to man; and not only to man, but also to beasts, and birds, and
fishes: she carries the vertue of the Sun to the creation, and
causes man to change from childe-hood to youth; from youth,
to Man-hood, from Man-hood, to Age; from Age, to decrepid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
she helps man to live, she helps man to dye: her one light
(if you note it) doth the like. A body may gather the whole
world is maintained by light: and as various as the light of the
Moon is, so various is the life of man. She receives her light
from the Sun: she increaseth, she comes to the full, she wanes,
and at last returnes to the place from whence she came; and so
must man.</p>
               <p>The Eclipse of the Moon is no way to be despised, neither is
the Eclipse of the Sun by the Moon: for this one judgement I
will give you now (although it be out of course) when the Moon is
Lady of the Ascendant, and Eclipseth the Sun in the Tenth; Such,
as the <hi>Magnates</hi> for want of better breeding, or more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, or humble-wort growing in their gardens) call vile,
Plebeian, and evil men; such as they could crush to peices (if
they knew but how) will rise up, both against Magistrates, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Rulers, and handle them without Mittens, as they have
handled them before; Kingdomes will be changed, and Beggars
will get on horse-back; let them have a care how they ride. I
hope I have not transgressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54723:7"/>The Moon is to the Sun, as an Ambassador is to a Prince:
the Sun gives her power and governs her, and supplies her both
with light and strength, from the time of the Conjunction to the
Opposition: in her Opposition, she is so proud, she thwarts him;
then he diminisheth her light, and takes away from her, what she
borrowed of him before; just as when a King sends out an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
to some people or Nation, the Ambassador grows proud,
and looks upon himself as an absolute King; The King quickly
knows how to make him know himself: even so the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
his light againe, brings her to nothing at all, and bids her
look to the rock from whence she was hewen.</p>
               <p>But I pray you now, when the Moon is in her full power, and
then Eclipsed, must this Eclipse signifie nothing? We will take
her signification to be a Queen, the governess of the night, and a
governess both over sea and land.</p>
               <p>There remaines but one thing more, which is to shew you what
what an Eclipse of the Moon is; for which, take this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>An Eclipse of the Moon, is a diametrical interposition of the
body of the earth, between the Sun and Moon, whereby the
light of the Sun, is hindered from the body of the Moon.</p>
               <p>I have done with this Chapter, if you will be pleased but to
take notice, that the Moon may be totally obscured in the same
Hemisphear, because the magnitude of the body of the earth,
is greater then the magnitude of the Moon; only take notice,
that the farther Eastward people in the same Hemisphear live, the
sooner to them will the Eclipse appear.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Attendants of the Eclipse.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS great men have many and great attendants, so hath this
great Eclipse of the Sun: And as some of the attendants of
great men run before them, others follow after; so do the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
also of this Eclipse: and all must be heeded, in this our
present Judgement.</p>
               <p>Before this Eclipse, was the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
in <hi>Pisces, Feb.</hi> 15. 1642/3. which Master <hi>Lilly</hi> so learnedly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of in his <hi>Prophetical Merlin:</hi> and to see how the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental
lines of Gods providence fix all in the same centre: <hi>Saturn</hi>
and <hi>Iupiter</hi> make three Oppositions, within the time of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this present Eclipse: a most strange thing, and not to be
contemned. Besides, there is an Eclipse of the Moon <hi>March</hi> 14. 1651/2
together with the position of the heavens at the Suns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
into <hi>Aries.</hi> The Conjunction of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
1651. is not to be despised: nor yet the Square of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> 1651/2.</p>
               <p>As followers of this Eclipse, we have another Eclipse of the
Moon in <hi>September,</hi> 1652. a Conjunction of the Sun and
<hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> 1652. of the Sun and <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi>
1652. of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> 1652. an Eclipse of the Moon in <hi>March,</hi> 1653. a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> 1654.
And the real truth is, all the Planets by all aspects, conduce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to further the operation of this Eclipse: therefore the Eclipse
must needs be great, not onely because so great a part of the Sun
is darkened, and that upon the very degree of his exaltation; but
also, because of the multitude and formidableness of its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants;
which having now shewed you what they are, I shall
proceed to shew you what they signifie, in this Chapter in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and afterwards in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54723:8"/>In the general, consider, that <hi>Saturn</hi> is an old worn-out Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
weary, and of little estimation in this world: he causeth
long and tedious sicknesses, abundance of sadness, and a Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
of doubts and fears: his nature is cold, and dry, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
And take special notice of this, that when <hi>Saturn</hi> is
Lord of an Eclipse (as he is one of the Lords of this) he governs
all the rest of the Planets, but none can govern him: <hi>Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is made of all the humors in the body of man, but no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of melancholy.</hi> He is envious, and keeps his anger long,
and speaks but few words; but when he speaks, he speaks to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
A man of deeep cogitations; he will plot mischief when
men are asleep: he hath an admirable memory, and remembers
to this day how <hi>William</hi> the Bastard abused him: he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be a slave: he is poor with the poor, fearful with the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
he plots mischief against the Superiours, with them that plot
mischief against them: have a care of him, <hi>KINGS</hi> and
<hi>MAGISTRATES</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi> he will shew you what
he can do, in the effects of this Eclipse: he is old, and therefore
hath large experience, and will give perilous counsel: he moves but
slowly, and therefore he doth the more mischief: all the Planets
contribute their natures and strength to him; and when he sets on
doing mischief, he will do it to purpose: he doth not regard the
company of the rest of the Planets, neither do any of the rest of
the Planets regard his: he is a barren Planet, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
not in women: he brings the Pestilence: he is destructive
to the fruits of the earth: he receives his light from the Sun, and
yet he hates the Sun that gives it him: he partakes with <hi>Mercury</hi>
to do mischief but nothing else: he will be obedient to no Planet;
neither will he be servant to any: once more, <hi>Look to it Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates:</hi>
he abhors <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by reason of his benevolence. And
pray take notice then, <hi>Saturn</hi> being Lord of the Eclipse, what
the effects of the three Oppositions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> may
produce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Post nubula Soles.</hi> Having considered the nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi>
let us a little consider the nature of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that so we may
make a firm foundation, to build our following Discourse upon.
<hi>Oh that men would be so wise us to consider that they would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54723:9"/>
but in this their day, consider the things that belong to their
peace, before it be hid from their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The effects of this Eclipse will spare none it lights upon, neither
will it play or dally with them, but, Torrent-like, sweep them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with a mighty ruine. I hope those that <hi>preach so fiercely
against Astrologie,</hi> when they feel the effects of this Eclipse,
will probably <hi>learn wit,</hi> when they are <hi>beaten</hi> to it. And
though I quote here the good nature of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> I do not think
the effects of the Eclipse will be good, as the nature of <hi>Iupiter</hi>
shews, because <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath little or no signification in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse:
but I hope such times may come after, and so people
may live in hopes of what benefit they or their children may live
to enjoy. I have a reason for this my hope too: for, to believe
a thing without a reason, is (in my opinion) foolery, and not
faith.</p>
               <p>It was the opinion of M.<hi>Lilly,</hi> in that MASTER-PIECE
of his, his PROPHETICAL MERLIN, that in the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter, Saturn</hi> was the strongest Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:
I can scarce believe it; neither was it ever my fancie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
accidental dignities, before essential. But I shall talk more of
this hereafter: onely thus much of the Conjunction, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the vulgar course of providence, should have happened
in a Kingly Signe; by the Almighty providence of God at this
time, and but at this time, since the Creation of the world, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in a Plebeian Signe, nay in the weakest Signe of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack:
but the Scripture must be verified; <hi>the Lord will pull down
the mighty, and exalt the humble and meek.</hi> Enough of this:
I come now to the nature of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iupiter</hi> delights in equality, and <hi>so do I:</hi> he delights in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
and goodness: and the reason why he doth so, is, because
he is a Planet temperate, in respect of heat, driness, coldness, and
moisture. He is a just, upright-dealing creature: he will not give
<hi>All</hi> to some, and <hi>None</hi> at all to the rest. He signifies much good
to the people, correction of Laws, single-heartedness, chastity. He
will correct men, but he will not undo them, neither destroy them.
He abhors the nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and keeps him from doing that
mischief which the poor old soul would willingly do. He is very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54723:9"/>
milde, and shews goodness in his forehead, and not coveteousness:
if he had a thousand a yeer, he would bestow it all upon the poor:
he alwayes speaks truth in his words, and carries himself truly in
his actions; and then to be sure he is neither Priest nor Lawyer:
You will be confident of it as well as I, if you do but consider he
hates coveteousness: the truth is, he mindes publique, and not
private good: he is fortunate in all his deeds, by the equality of
his temper: the heat of the Summer, and cold of Winter, is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
by him: the truth of it is, by the salubrious beams of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
an equality is made in the creation. And now there comes
in my head an odd passage of Doctor <hi>Gell,</hi> in his last Sermon
preached before the learned Society of Astrologers; <hi>God</hi> (said
he) <hi>set the bounds of the people according to the number of
the Angels of God: therefore there ought to be no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
But, by Doctor <hi>Gell's</hi> leave, who desires a Community? we
desire but our own birth-rights, and the heavy yoak <hi>William</hi> the
Bastard laid upon us, taken off; and should be glad if we could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that: only this I desire of Doctor <hi>Gell</hi> (whom I honor both
for his learning and piety) when God did divide Nations accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the number of the Angels, whether he gave All to some, and
None at all to the rest? whether he left any poor in the land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
for? whether he made them not All Free-holders? and
leave him to be answered by his own conscience.</p>
               <p>Thus much for <hi>Iupiter:</hi> I come now to <hi>Mars,</hi> and I shall be
the more large in him, because he is the chief significator of the
effects of this Eclipse.</p>
               <p>This world, as it stands <hi>in statu quo,</hi> makes a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
rich and poor men; and when a man hath pickt up a great
deal of well-concocted earth, I am a better man then thou, quoth
he; though perhaps the birth and breeding of the other, be ten
times better then this: but as the Grave equals all men, so do
Celestial influences: nay I will tell you more then this, Magistrates
are grown to such a terrible hight of Pride, that this Eclipse will
teach them, that the Lord knows the proud afar off. Miserable
and sad are the effects of the Eclipse like to be, when the two
infortunes are Lords of it; and so they are in this: but what their
operation will be, I am now to speak of only in the general; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54723:10"/>
I will prefix this Scripture in the front of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 28. 5. <hi>If they
regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operations of his
hand, he will pull them down, and not build them up. Mars</hi>
is the chief Lord of the Eclipse; and you shall see what a kinde
of creature he is: he is a hot and dry, firy burning Planet; an
angry conquering creature, destructive to nature: he is so angry,
that he will hear no reason: the Priest with his Rhetorick in the
Pulpit, cannot move him; neither doth he regard the Lawyer
that pleads at the bar: all the Sophistry in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
will not be able to qualifie his anger in the effects of this
Eclipse, but are all like to feel his fury: he layes out all his
strength in what he doth, or in what he delighteth to do: his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
disposition is to set people together by the ears: I may say of
him, as <hi>Virgil</hi> said of <hi>Alecto,</hi>

               <p>Look you here now, what a master the eternal God of heaven
and earth hath appointed you over this Eclipse; one that delights
in nothing in the world but killing and murdering, setting people
together by the ears, quarrelling, folly, and impatience, vehement
anger: one that neither fear nor entreaty is able to hold or retard
from sowing the seed of sedition and war, when he sets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturne,</hi> I told you before, was another Lord of the Eclipse; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54723:10"/>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> is exalted in the house of <hi>Saturne,</hi> as though both the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volents
were conjoyned to execute the will of God in the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
effects of this Eclipse. <hi>Mars</hi> is of that nature, that he will
run on, right or wrong, and never regard what the end will be. He
causes infirmities and sicknesses, diminution of substance, madness,
and revenge, thunder and lightening; and what else can terrific
the mindes of the giddy-headed multitude.</p>
               <p>But in this Eclipse, because <hi>Venus</hi> is neer him, she will somewhat
qualifie his malice: I shall shew you hereafter how and in what
manner; onely in this place, what the general disposition of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
is, that so I may hold to what I promised, onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> is a Planet cold and moist, fortunate, merry, and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund:
I would we of the Commonalty of <hi>England</hi> had cause so
to be: we shall have, we must have; they had as good let us have
it at first as at last; the heavens promise it us, and it is in vaine for
man to domineer.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Heu, nihil invitis fas quemquam credere divis.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Th' effects of this Eclipse shall clearly prove</l>
                  <l>'Tis vaine to strive against the powers above.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Besides this, by her coldness and moisture, she somewhat tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
the hot and dry disposition of <hi>Mars:</hi> and if we bring it home
to this Eclipse, she orders him, having gotten him in her house,
she loves singing, and banquetting, and drinking, and venerial vices,
diseases that come therefrom; and therefore in this Eclipse, she
hath got a sit companion in her house, cut out for the purpose.
<hi>Mars</hi> and she usually cause whoredom, and sometimes a knock
with a French colt-staffe: she gives very good words, and is
very meek of nature: she will give good words to the poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are cheap, and cost nothing: she is an enemy to <hi>Saturne,</hi>
though she give him an exaltation in her house. I will leave <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and come to <hi>Mercury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> loves all Arts, and hath gotten a special command
over all Clerks &amp; Accomptants: and he is of a convertible nature,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54723:11"/>
just like a Priest, I should have said a Weather-cock: he is mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
with the masculine, and feminine with the feminine: he is
a fortune with the fortunes; an infortune with the infortunes: he
is a bold spoken fellow, full of tongue; his father was either a
Priest or a Lawyer, I know not which: he is a chearful creature,
quick in his actions: he is a divellish lyar, a betrayer; as full of
deceit as an egg is full of meat: he will promise more by a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
candle, then he will perform in seven yeers: he signifies
windes; and in this Eclipse, <hi>such windes</hi> as will <hi>rend</hi> the <hi>stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Rocks in Europe</hi> in peices.</p>
               <p>These be the Planets, which (as I shall tell you hereafter) have
one way or another signification in this Eclipse; and there can
be no more, nor more variety of these significations which I have
here delivered.</p>
               <p>I have shewed you here their natures in general; I come now
to shew you their natures in particular: only before this, let me
premise this one thing, the Moon hath a very great signification
in the effects of this Eclipse; the general signification of which, I
gave you in the first Chapter, the particular signification, both
of her, and other Planets, you shall have hereafter, when I
come to the particular dimension of time, in which the effects of
this Eclipse are to Operate.</p>

PART I.</head>
                  <p>Had it not been unavoidable to my present discourse, I would
not so much as have mentioned this great and rare Conjunction:
rare, because the world never saw the like; great, because rare:
and the reason why I would not have mentioned it, is, because
Master <hi>Lilly</hi> hath so learnedly Treated of it in his <hi>Prophetical
Merlin,</hi> in which you shall finde this speech, not to be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised.</p>
                  <p>The first restitution of the Firy Trigon in the Conjunction
of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> happened in <hi>Enochs</hi> time. The second,
at the universal Deluge. The third, in the delivery from the
Egyptian Bondage. The fourth, in the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy.
The fifth, in the time of Christ, and the Roman Empire. The
sixth, in <hi>Charles</hi> the great. And now the seventh hath a secret
mystery of Sabbatisme in it, and promiseth some thing of more
singular moment to the world then the other. <hi>Thus Master</hi>
Lilly <hi>very learnedly, and as truly wrote.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this give me leave to add one speech of the Jewish Rabbies,
That as God made the world in six dayes, and rested the seventh,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54723:12"/>
so the world should enjoy six thousand yeers of trouble, and one
thousand or Sabbaticall time of rest; as God rested the seventh
day, so shall the world have a thousand yeers of rest, after six
thousand of trouble; in which time the kingdoms of the
world should become the Kingdoms of our God and of his
Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither is this much disconsonant from that of the Apostle,</hi>
Rom. <hi>8. 19, 21, &amp;c.</hi> For the earnest expectation of the creature
waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. Because
the creature it self also shall be dilivered from bondage of
corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God,
<hi>&amp;c. I do not desire to be accounted a Prophet, nor do I plead
revelations for what I write; yet a little time may prove me to
be no lyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall onely quote you what a few Authors say of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. <hi>Campanella</hi> saith, <hi>That the Conjunction of</hi> Saturne
<hi>and</hi> Jupiter, <hi>under the fourth triplicity, which is inimicall
to the first triplicity, the prerogative of Monarchy will be so
shaken, that it will neuer be able to stand upright more (nor
perhaps ever did in conditions) dreadful heresies</hi> (anglicè
<hi>excellent truths) will begin to appear and be protected by
force of armes: faith is enlarged more by the sword then by
miracles: new Religions arise, and set a period to the auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the former</hi> (as much as if he had said, Knowledge begins
to break through the clouds of ignorance) <hi>yet will all this be to
a good intent, because the Stars only incline, but it is in the
use of mans liberty, to use this inclination either to good or
bad.</hi> Blame me not for being a little copious upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction:
for without the due consideration of this, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
I should judge rightly of the Eclipse of the Sun: and I must
be a little critical against all Authors; I hope Master <hi>Lilly</hi> will
pardon, me if I dissent a little from him: if he may freely write
his own judgement, why may not I by the same rule? The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> (calculated by the Rudolphine
Tables) it seems happened in the second house; I shall not be
very critical against either the truth of the Rudolphine Tables, nor
yet at the ability of Master <hi>Matthew Fisk</hi> that calculated them;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54723:12"/>
whose noble spirit is returned to God that gave it; neither will I
exclaime upon other Authors, as <hi>Noel Durret, Argol,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
all which differ in time (yet not so much in that, as Master
<hi>Fiske</hi> and Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi> differed in the calculation of
that in 1603.) By <hi>Argols</hi> computation, it should be in the ninth
house: <hi>Argol</hi> might be a little mistaken; and the effects shall
prove, before they are half over, that it happened in the tenth, and
the figure not much different from that of this Eclipse: I cannot
at this time stand to give you my reasons, let experience be judge,
<hi>Time will tell truth, when I may not.</hi> Besides, since the time
of this Conjunction, never more never greater <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> have
been seen in the aire: never more <hi>Parelii</hi> or mock-Suns, or
<hi>Paraselenes,</hi> or mock-Moons, have been seen in <hi>England,</hi> since <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> the bastard, then have been seen
in one yeer: not a yeer hath past our heads, but more then one
of them hath appeared; besides other supernatural sights; and
rest confident, more yet to come: and if ever God shewed any
thing in vaine, this is the first time that ever he did it.</p>
                  <p>To proceed, when the two superiors returned to the watry
triplicity, dreadful Wars are stirred up for Religion, or by the
Clergy; as many Religions appear in a Nation, as there are haires
upon a mans head; strange Engines are invented for war: the
sword, famine, and pestilence afflict the earth.</p>
                  <p>If the Conjunction happen in <hi>Pisces,</hi> as this last did, and not far
distant from <hi>Aries</hi> neither, the Clergy are reformed (pray God they
do not reform them all away) new opinions vex the Church, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
arise (as the Ranters did now.) The Signe is double bodied, and
people do all with a double heart; or, as the Hebrew hath it, with a
heart and a heart; so that we may truly say by the effects of this
Conjunction, as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Help, Lord, for the godly
man ceaseth, and the faithful fail from among the children of
men: they speak vanity every one with his neighbour, with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
lips, and with a heart and a heart. But the Lord will cut
off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things.</hi>
The first we know to be true, the second I expect. However, this
is certain; <hi>Pisces</hi> being the house of a superior Planet, and neer
at hand to <hi>Aries,</hi> common people will carry themselves in more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54723:13"/>
then an ordinary Majestical way. If their <hi>Taskmasters</hi> set them
to make brick, and give them no straw, they will rebel: And just
in the nick of time when they are in such a humor, cometh this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
of the Sun; which, what it will produce, more anon: as
also, three Oppositions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which will kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
such a fire in <hi>Europe,</hi> between the <hi>Magistrates, Ministers,</hi>
and <hi>common People,</hi> which all the water in the Sea is not able
to quench. Besides <hi>Albumazar</hi> saith, that <hi>if the Conjunction
of</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Jupiter <hi>happen in</hi> Scorpio <hi>or</hi> Pisces,<hi>the effects thereof will work but slowly.</hi> And that haply may be the reason
the effects of this Eclipse appeared in their colours no sooner. But
if all the powers of heaven can blowe the coals to make them
burn, this Eclipse of the Sun will do it: and the bellows will
blowe the better, because <hi>Mars</hi> in this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> was in Quartile to the Sun, and now Lord of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse.</p>
                  <p>From these Principles thus considered, let us build a little ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Judgement upon this Conjunction, that so we may have a
sure foundation, to erect our Judgement of this Eclipse upon. Men
are undone, by rapine and violence of sonldiers. The whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Europe</hi> is in a mutiny; and they have as much patience as
a <hi>nest of Wasps.</hi> Thieving, rapine, and injustice, are Lords Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
of Seas and Land. The Merchants trading is bad; he
scarce knows into what Country to trade; and when he doth, he
loseth his ships by Sea. The world is mad, and servants turn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
and what will the end be?</p>
                  <p>Kings and great men are undone: the Priest and Lawyer leaveth
prating, and fall to fretting. It is the opinion of <hi>Guido Bonatus,</hi>
upon a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Pisces,</hi> that <hi>all
the evil that is done (and that is not a little) will be done
under pretence of Religion:</hi> which how true it hath proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in <hi>England,</hi> every one that hath but wit enough to eat an
egge, knoweth. Besides, <hi>Leovitius</hi> quotes a great Conjunction
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> to have happened in <hi>Pisces,</hi> 1524. In
the first yeer of the effects of it, happened great inundations of
water; <hi>France</hi> was absolutely over-run: let them beware now;
it's as likely to fall to their share now, as a Pomwater is like an
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54723:13"/>
apple. Next yeer after, the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the ears; in which unfortunate Battel, the poor <hi>French
King</hi> was taken: it was well he scaped so too. The Duke of
<hi>Saxony</hi> payeth his debts to Nature, and sleepeth both day and
night to the Resurrection. The <hi>Boors</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> are up in arms;
and such a mortal fury possesseth their brains, that within four
months space above an hundred thousand men were slain, and the
matter examined after, whether guilty or not guilty. The King
of <hi>Hungary</hi> goeth to war with the <hi>Turk;</hi> but he never returned
home alive to tell how he sped. <hi>France, England, Venice,</hi> and
almost all <hi>Europe,</hi> was together by the ears. <hi>Rome</hi> was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
sacked, and pillaged, by the Duke of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> and the
Duke himself was slain in the assault. His Holiness <hi>Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the seventh</hi> of that name, when neither wit nor holiness
would serve his turn, yeelds himself a prisoner. <hi>Holland</hi> was
quite routed and depopulated: a fair warning to make them a
little quieter now; and they would take warning, if God had not
an intent to scourge them. A huge <hi>Comet,</hi> with a terrible tail
appeared, such a one as operated in the effects of this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
                  <p>Certainly these providential ways of God were made for
Priests to learn by, and not to rail at. The Pestilence and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
wandered all over <hi>Europe.</hi> The Bishops of <hi>Germany</hi> were
all together by the ears with the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi> The <hi>Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
were at Civil war; and what was it about, think you?
truely, about that MONSTER called <hi>RELIGION.</hi> The <hi>Turk.</hi>
falleth into <hi>Austria,</hi> and besieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> but did not take it.
The Sea devoureth a great part of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A body would think here were enough to bid the Nations of
<hi>Europe</hi> beware the effects of this Conjunction: and they would
do it, did not God hide wisdom from their eyes, that so he may
destroy them.</p>
                  <p>I shall onely quote one Aphorism of <hi>Rigel,</hi> concerning this
Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> yet in force, but not in
his height, till this present Eclipse: and with it I will conclude this
first Part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:54723:14"/>
                     <hi>Dreadful streamings are seen in the air; whether in the
forms of Comets, or other forms, it matters not.</hi> And I pray
(to leave my Author a little) when have there been more seen then
since the time of this Conjunction? When more Mock-Suns, and
more Mock-Moons? Not a yeer hath past without divers of
them, as I told you before; and had not mentioned them twice,
had the significations not been prevalent. And if you have not
enough, you shall have enough, before this yeer of 1652 pass
over your heads, even such that shall make your hearts ake for
fear. And truely, whatever you think, I am of opinion, God
shews nothing in vain.</p>
                  <p>To proceed: <hi>Hot infirmities, acute diseases, wars and
dissentions between Kings and their people, and between one
King and another.</hi> And when Kings are together by the ears
with one another, let them remember what <hi>AEsop</hi> said of the
Mouse and the Frog; who whilst they were busie in fight, came
a Kyte and carried them both away. Look to it, Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi>
there will appear upon the wing, within these four yeers, a
Kyte that will serve you in the same sauce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To proceed:</hi> An universal evil will over-spread <hi>Europe,</hi>
though probably it may be greater in one part then in another.
Many signes will be seen in the heavens, beyond the course of
nature, either round, or like crosses or pillars; whose effects
you may know, if you consider the hour they appear in.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the first Part of this Chapter, namely, the
Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter.</hi>

                  <p>Considering the Conjunction of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> lately
past, and that <hi>Mars</hi> is not onely Lord, but also chief disposer of
the Eclipse, neither are the effects of that Conjunction over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed;
we shall therefore, in all reason, speak a word or two of
that Conjunction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the first place, it signifies</hi> hot, dry, and blasting windes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive

eastern nations are together by the ears; 'tis past my wit to
part them. Many infirmities will men be incident to: some
women play the whores, others die. And if you consider him
as he is in this Eclipse, in the eleventh House, Kings and their
subjects cannot agree: the subjects have got a sword by the
hilt, and care not a halfpeny for a Proclamation. 'Tis not
words, but swords, that must end the difference. Friends fall
out; and that is an ill time. Many fornications are threa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<hi>March</hi> 14. 1651/2. it happens in the first Face of <hi>Libra:</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, consider the Luminary eclipsed is in the eighth House,
which, considering it as in an airy Signe, threatens</hi> many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,

heat of blood; a terrible change both in Religion and Law;
death of ancient people. <hi>The Signe being humane, the effects

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> saith, that an Eclipse happening in Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial
Signes, their accidents happen upon <hi>such men as profess ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
though they have little or none in them:</hi> upon such as
pervert the Law, and set Injustice in the place of Justice; and
know not equity from bribery. Also he saith, that if it happen
in the eighth House, it signifies <hi>a change of the Law; men will
be deceived of their Legacies, and the seeds of the earth will
be destroyed.</hi> Also, if <hi>Iupiter</hi> be Lord of the Eclipse, and in
<hi>Capricorn, Guiffus</hi> saith the effects thereof will work most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
in winter. I suppose his meaning is, When the Sun comes
to the place where <hi>Iupiter</hi> was, (and it is a good reason) they

will appear in Sea-fishes, and Ships at sea, and Birds which live

                  <p>As concerning its congruity with the Vernal Ingress of <hi>Sol</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Aries,</hi> or (which is more proper) the Earth into <hi>Libra,</hi> let
this suffice briefly, that it happens in the twelfth House of that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
and upon the very Cusp; shewing a yeer full of injuries and
straights: servants will slip their necks out of the collar, and turn
masters: subjects will rebel; and Kings are in a miserable case,
and yet will they be as tyrannical as ever: subjects rise in arms
against their Kings: fearful wars, terrible seditions, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mutinies, appear in the world. Let such as are wise, look to
themselves: for 'tis no question but the <hi>fools will run on, although
they be punished.</hi>

                  <p>The Conjunction of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Sagittarius</hi> comes
next to be considered; touching which, I would have writen more,
had not the press staid for me: the truth of it is, the position is but
wretched; it happened <hi>Sept.</hi> 13. 1651. they may set the position
that have less to do then I: the first degree of <hi>Virgo</hi> ascends;
the time is 15 ho. 8 min. <hi>p.m.</hi> what they do in the Conjunction,
they must do alone, for there is not one Planet strong enough to
lend the least assistance. <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> are in their detriments,
and in Opposition too, and that is worse, and fils the heads of the
vulgar with madness and sadness: <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Sol</hi> are in their fals,
and <hi>Mercury</hi> is with the Dragons Taile, a most pitiful position as
ever your eyes saw; nay there is another thing in the wind, one or
two; the Sun is neer the place where the Moon is eclipsed in <hi>March:</hi>
but that which shall bear the bell away is, the Eclipse of the Sun
happens upon the very cuspe of the ninth house of the Conjunction,
and the Conjunction with a hot violent furious malevolent and
martial fixed Star, <hi>cor Scorpii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This premised, we come a little to judgement. The Conjunction
of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars, sets the sword-men and gown-men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the ears:</hi> this I am confident is so rational, that none
but a <hi>Clergie man,</hi> will have the face to deny it. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
my judgement here, which shall get the better of it; a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little time will manifest which is sharpest, the Priests wit, or
the souldiers sword: only take notice, and then I have done, that
the Conjunction happening in the fourth house in a fiery signe,
and with a fiery fixed Star, not only consumes the fruits of the
earth by heat and driness, but also consumes whole Cities and
Towns by fire and sword: also this happening in a humane signe,
(for the first ½ of <hi>Sagittarius</hi> is humane)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There will be much effusion of blood amongst men: the Nations
subject to</hi> Sagittarius, <hi>are never in their elements, but when they
are together by the ears: look to it</hi> Spaine <hi>and</hi> Hungary, <hi>it will
touch thee; and let the</hi> Turk <hi>have a care he loose not</hi> Buda <hi>either
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54723:16"/>
by fire or sword, and say I told him of it. I shall conclude this,
after I have quoted the judgement of</hi> Haly <hi>upon such a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
When <hi>Mars</hi> is joyned to <hi>Jupiter</hi> men are in a quarrelling
humor, and altogether about Religion, and when they have
snarled a while, then they fight: the sword rageth in the earth,
sickness and mortality follows it, <hi>so that those which scape the
sword, may die by the pestilence:</hi> beasts of great valour, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in colour, will appear in the aire: the beginning of the
yeer will be very fruitful, but heat and driness consume the
fruits of the earth, before the harvest.</p>
                  <p>The King of the Country subject to the influence of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
dies: look to it, <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Hungary;</hi> and let the <hi>Bassa</hi>
of <hi>Buda</hi> beware of a bow-string, or something else as bad. As
for the Quartile of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> which happens in <hi>Febr.</hi> 1651/2. I shall speak nothing, but only refer you to those most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
pithy, and most true verses of <hi>George Wharton</hi> Esquire, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that month; and they are these:
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Mars</hi> laies his knap-sack by, and stoutly draws,</l>
                        <l>His trusty bilbow to prescribe us Laws.</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Jove</hi> claims his priviledge, and <hi>Mars</hi> his power;</l>
                        <l>Both wrangle hard, and each on other lower,</l>
                        <l>At length, <hi>Jove</hi> yeilds, and <hi>Mars</hi> assumes the chaire;</l>
                        <l>Votes his own person noble, doings faire.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus you see what way is made by other Planets, for the
effects of this Eclipse, at what posture the inclinations of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
stand; and the disposition of sublunary bodies, is from them
like to be found at the time of their operating.</p>

               <p>SO various have the opinions of Authors been, about this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
and such difference in Tables, such halucination in the
parallax of the Moon, that it would set a mans braines in such an
extasie, that like <hi>Hercules,</hi> it would bring him to <hi>ne plus ultra.</hi>
The time of the day is not agreed upon, nor yet what part of the
body of the Sun will remaine enlightened, whether the North, or
the South part: nay, Authors vary that have calculated by one
and the same Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>And if others may make bold to please themselves, why may
not I have the same liberty? Therefore I got my special and loving
friend (whom I esteem an able Artist) M. <hi>Samuel Warre,</hi> to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
this Eclipse for me, by the Tables of <hi>Bullialdus;</hi> together
with the position of the heavens at that time, and the Type of the
Eclipsed Luminaries.</p>

                  <p>1. Consider what Province or City is signified by the signe the Eclipse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in; and be sure that suffers.</p>
                  <p>2. Consider what Kingdoms or Cities are under the Signe the Lords of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
are in; and be sure their diet is served them with the same sauce.</p>
                  <p>3. Note the nature of the Signe the Eclipse happens in: if it be violent, as
this is, the effects of the Eclipse will be the like: if it be moveable, they begin
betimes: if firy, they signifie War, and diseases of heat: if fixed, the effects,
though they work slowly, yet they work surely: if both firy and fixed, as that
will be 1654. they threaten a <hi>Hectick War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Take notice of the nature of the Signe: if humane, men suffer; if bestial,
beasts also: and if beasts, then of necessity man, because he takes his nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from beasts. And now if I were minded to be critical, what a gallant oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
have I! Suppose the Signe be watry? then, quoth my learned Authors,
the water is afflicted: and if the water be afflicted, the earth must needs be,
because it is nourished by the water: if the earth be afflicted, then beasts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are nourished by the earth: beasts, earth, and water, nourish man;
and why must not he be afflicted too? Either the Signe the Eclipse is in, or the
Signe the Lords of the Eclipse are in, being hot and dry, cause corruption by heat
and driness: if cold and moist, by coldness and moisture. In this present E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
the Signe is hot and dry; <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Cancer,</hi> cold and moist: What mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
is it, if it drown a <hi>Sea-town,</hi> and consume a <hi>Land-town</hi> by fire?</p>
                  <p>5. It is probably apparent, that one and the same Eclipse may cause driness
in one place, and moistness in another, thunder and lightning in a third, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
in a fourth, barrenness in a fifth, and burnings in a sixth; and as many
more as God pleases.</p>
                  <p>6. Whatsoever evil falls upon Princes and Magistrates, must needs touch the
Commonally.</p>
                  <p>7. An Eclipse of the Sun falling upon the angle of the Ascendant of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
kills the native: if it fall within three degrees, it brings such a disease
as cannot be claw'd off again with speed; especially if the <hi>malevolent</hi> beheld
the eclipsed <hi>Luminary</hi> at the <hi>Genesis,</hi> and more probably, if the eclipsed <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries</hi>
be with the <hi>Dragons tail,</hi> then if he be with the <hi>Dragons head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. The Dragons head regards Princes most; the Dragons tail, the Plebeians.</p>
                  <p>9. If between the time of the Eclipse, and the effects of the Eclipse, a good
direction operate in the Nativity of a private person, he need fear no evil, though
the Eclipse threaten him never so sore. <hi>The curst Cow hath but short horns.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>A general Iudgment of the Effects of this Eclips.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND in handling this, I shall give you first the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Authors upon the Eclips. Secondly, former
examples of Eclipses of like nature. Thirdly, my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it.</p>
               <p>To the first of these, namely, the judgement of Authors,
and in the judgment of Authors we have many things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider:
As first of all the house of Heaven, in which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
happens, which is the tenth house, the house of
Kings, Princes, and other potentates, and the house of all
such as lord it over their brethren; the Luminaries Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the tenth house foreshowes death or deposition to
Kings, Princes, Magistrates, and such as call and account
themselves Ecclesiastical persons; thus <hi>Giuffus,</hi> and this he
confesseth depends upon the will of God, and so it doth;
and yet it were wisdom for so many of them as lie under the
lash of this Eclips, (which who they be more anon) they have
timely admonition, and a woful experience given them in
<hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14, 15. and 16 <hi>verses,</hi> and a joyful promise to
them that fear God in the 17. <hi>verse. They regard not the
works of the Lord, nor consider the operation of his hands;
therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have
no knowledge, and their honorable men are famished, and
their multitudes are dried up with thirst: Therefore the
grave hath enlarged her self, and opened her mouth without
measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their
pomp, and he that rejoyceth shall descend into it: And the
mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall
be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: But
the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that
is holy, shall be sanctified in righteousness.</hi> Father of mercy
look down upon all those <hi>Magistrates</hi> that fear thy name;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54723:21"/>
thou knowest what man is, thou knowest he is but dust;
and what can I say to the Magistracy of this Nation, any
more then what <hi>Daniel</hi> said to <hi>Nebuchad nezzar;</hi> (pray do
not mistake me, I do not liken you to <hi>Nebuchad nezzar,</hi> nor
my self to <hi>Daniel:</hi> yet this I say, these things were writ for
our instruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come)
if you will keep your places, you must know that THE
HEAVENS DO RULE, <hi>Daniel</hi> 4. 27: <hi>Wherefore, Oh</hi>
KINGS <hi>and</hi> MAGISTRATES, <hi>let my counsel be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to you; break off your sins by righteousness, and your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
by shewing mercy to the poor, it may be a lengthning of
your tranquility.</hi> I am sure it might have been, had that
course been taken in time, had your PRIESTS discreetly
handled according to the genuine meaning of the holy
Ghost, these two Scriptures, this and that I quoted to you
in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> when they thundred out with a terrible voice,
<hi>Curse yee</hi> Meroz, <hi>curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof,</hi>
&amp;c. How happy might it have been for this poor Nation;
how happy had all the Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> been, if their lazy
Clergy had done the like. But the greatest part of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
now living in <hi>Europe,</hi> follow the example of Priests
of <hi>Bell</hi> in the <hi>Apochripha;</hi> eat and drink of the best, live
idlely, and deceive their Princes.</p>
               <p>You may remember I left you before at <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5. the 16.
<hi>verse,</hi> the 17. <hi>verse</hi> gives comfort to them that fear God,
and uprightly serve him; for when the Lord shall have
brought to pass what he threatned in the former verses:
<hi>Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall the lambs feed after their maner, and the
wast places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</hi> Indeed, the truth
is, a general peace may be expected throughout the Earth, &amp;
now blush for shame all you that rail and scould at Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
when you see the times of the book of the Scripture
and the book of the Creatures, end in a Centre: And thus
much for the house afflicted.</p>
               <p>In the second place we come to the Planet afflicted, and
the sign he is afflicted in.</p>
               <p>The Planet afflicted is the ☉, what his signification was,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54723:21"/>
I told you in the beginning of the Treatise, but seeing we
are long in learning, and very subject to forget such things
as threaten evil to us; I will give you a brief Epitomy of
what persons are signified by the ☉, <hi>He signifies all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
in general from the Emperor to the petty Constable;
the sign afflicted, is ♈, the exaltation of the ☉, and the
chiefest sign in the Zodiak; we shall tell you by and by what
hath ensued upon the Eclipses of the ☉, in ♈ in former ages:
♈ is a sign, Masculine, Diurnal, Moveable, Cardinal, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial,
Fiery, Cholerick, Bestial, Domestical, Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Intemperate, Violent, Oriental.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The opinion of</hi> Giuffus <hi>of an Eclips of</hi> ☉ <hi>in</hi> ♈ <hi>is this,</hi> (<hi>I
pray God it do not prove too true</hi>) It threatens destruction
to the fruits of the Earth, kills the fruit in the bud, kills sheep
and other cattel; great <hi>KINGS, PRINCES,</hi> and <hi>MAGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRATES,</hi>
are either banished or imprisoned or put to death.
Princes and their Subjects agree like Cats and Dogs, first they
snarl, and then together by the ears; huge Armies, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wars, slaughters of men, burning of Towns, Theft, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
Depopulations, Fire, and the sword raign lords para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
in the Nations threatned by this Eclips: <hi>Neither
shall the women want their share; for,</hi> for, such of them as
are with child shall be too too subject to miscarry; (<hi>let them
make use of my DIRECTORY for MIDWIVES to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it</hi>) both men and women are subject to acute Feavers,
or other Epidemical diseases; the air is hot, blasting, and
burning; barrenness of the Earth and dearth of Corn is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to those Nations under ♈, <hi>CHANGE</hi> of <hi>GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT,</hi>
death of <hi>KINGS, Magistrates,</hi> and rich men, the
execution of which <hi>my Author confesseth is in the hands of
God; the less reason have the</hi> Priests <hi>to rail at him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We leave now <hi>Giuffus</hi> and come to <hi>Proclus;</hi> but before
I quote the words of <hi>Proclus,</hi> here is something else to be
considered; namely, in what face of ♈ this Eclips is to be
found, we vulgarly hold that it is in the latter end of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond face;
and we know as well that since the Creation the
fixed Stars are almost moved out of the signs they were Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54723:22"/>
in: now the query lies thus, whether we should take
the faces, according to the signs, or the fixed Stars in the
signs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We will not much contend about the business, ye may
take which you please, there is never a barrel better Herring,
and in both</hi> Proclus <hi>shall be my Author: if we take the Eclips
to happen according to the vulgar account in the second face
of</hi> ♂, It makes Kings and Magistrates Goal-birds, and if
it do not lay them in prison, it most terribly afflicts them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the world thrives with them, what ever the matter
is; some of them whom God pleases lose their heads, and
then they feel the lighte<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, others are hanged, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
feel at all, tis as <hi>wretched a time for Kings as ever the
Sun saw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you will measure the time by the fixed Stars, it
happens in the last face of ♓, and that shews <hi>Sedition, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
Fierceness, and Inhumanity of Souldiers, Souldiers
will be in Armes against their Governors right or wrong, a
sword and a gun are two prevailing arguments:</hi> there is none
like them to be found in <hi>Keckermans</hi> Logick, nor <hi>Ramus</hi>
Dialects, all the Sophistry in all the Universities in the
world will not be able to appease them, <hi>Caesar</hi> is dead, and
cannot appease his souldiers dangerous mutiny; <hi>Galesus</hi> in
<hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Emathion</hi> in <hi>Ovid</hi> were both slain in doing the
like Office: when the business comes to pass you'll know
what I mean; mean season, let old father Time be witness ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the truth or falsehood of my predictions; and thus
much for the Planet Eclipsed, and the sign and place he is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed
in.</p>
               <p>We come now in the thrid place, to the Lords of the
Eclips, of which ♂ will challenge the preheminence, and
will be angry if we should not give it him, and now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but remember two verses in <hi>Lucau,</hi> I'll make use but of
one verse and a peece of another.
<q>
                     <l>Quid tantum Gradive paras? Nam mitis inalto,</l>
                     <l>Iupiter occasu premitnr—</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:54723:22"/>What, What! Stout ♂, and must thou needs rule all,</l>
                     <l>Poor <hi>Iove</hi> is set ith' West, and in his fall.</l>
                  </q>
Take notice ♂ rules the souldiery, even from the <hi>Generalissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>
to the <hi>Snapsack boy;</hi> let none of them take exception at
this, it belongs to them all as they are a <hi>Military</hi> body:
♃ signifies all civil Magistrates, Priests and Lawyers: a Boy
of 14. years old deserves to be whipt, that cannot pick Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
out of this.</p>
               <p>We shall shew you what the actions of ♂ in the effects
of this Eclips will be.</p>
               <p>First, Generally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Specially.</p>
               <p>First, Generally according to <hi>Origanus,</hi> he consumes the
fruits of the Earth, casually by fire, accidentally by heat
and driness; the ayre will be hot and dry, and goods of rich
men, which they love as dearly as they love their lives, which
they have tired their UNLUCKY and COMMON-WEALTH
DESTROYING braines to get, shall be extorted by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and consumed by souldiery, all the miseries the sword
can bring upon a people, and they are not a few; war, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
rapine, extortion; when a covetous man sowes his corn
he knows not who shall reap it, (yet this I'll tell you by and
by, the Lord by a special providence may look after them
that fear him) the air is hot and dry, pestilential and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
all <hi>Europe</hi> is together by the ears, not only one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but also with themselves; <hi>Asmodeus</hi> the lecherous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
enters into men and women, and drawes them to their
ruine; Kings and Magistrates are mad, and Subjects are as
stubborne.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Pallida Tisiphone (<hi>i e.</hi> ultio cordis) media inter millia sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</l>
                  <l>—No fear their wrath asswageth,</l>
                  <l>Revenge of heart midst many thousand rageth.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The bodies of men are troubled with choller; Towns and
Cities are consumed by fire, and ruined by souldiery, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and theevery are as familiar, as butterflies in <hi>April:</hi>
thus for <hi>Origanus,</hi> and if I have a little commented upon him,
blame me not if I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:54723:23"/>We'll come now to <hi>Giuffus:</hi> ♂ lord of an Eclipse sets the
Nations signified by the Eclipse together by the ears, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the TYRANNY of PRINCES, seditions, tumults of
the People; Princes and Magistrates are angry, the people are
like mad dogs, they run at every thing they are set at; a
thousand reproaches, disdaines, and ill words begin the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
imprisonment is the middle; death and repentance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
great ones the latter end; the law shall be changed,
and the souldiers sword shall be sharper then the Scholers
wit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Particularly.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we'll consider the sign ♂ is in: <hi>Giuffus,</hi>
if ♂ be lord of the Ecclips, and in ♉: four footed beasts
must go to wrack, especially such as are useful to men, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
oxen and horses: the fruits of the Earth shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
by caterpilars, violent heat destroys the corn, either
upon the ground or putrifies it in the barns.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>Albumazar</hi> saith, if ♂ have North Latitude, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
many infirmities, the Small-pox, Measels, &amp;c. if South
Latitude, death of women and cattle; but in this Eclips having
no Latitude, for ought I know he may perform them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Messaholah</hi> saith, that ♂ having dominion in an Eclips
of the ☉ causeth corruption by his heat, diseases of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and heat of blood, violence, injury, dissention, tumults,
and uproars amongst the people, (look to it <hi>France,</hi> if thou
finde not this too true, say I am a lier, and I'll be content to
bear the name with patience) also thunder, lightning, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
scorching driness, sedition, and privy conspiracy, plague,
pestilence, and famine, battel, murther, and sudden death,
though the Dull headed <hi>Colledge</hi> of SORBON pray never so
earnestly, <hi>Good Lord deliver us. Proclus,</hi> an Eclipse of the
☉ in the fiery triplicity, signifies war, great drought, cruel
seditions, bitter controversies, mortal sicknesses, driness and
barrenness of the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>steed,</hi> if the Eclips of the ☉ be in a fiery sign, and ♂
ruler both of it and the year, signifies great burnings.</p>
               <p>We pass now to the second significator of this Eclipse,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54723:23"/>
which is the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, because she is lady of the succeeding Angle <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
which Angle ♋ possesses the middle face of it, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants
of the Eclipse: If the <hi>Moon</hi> be lady of the Eclips
quoth <hi>Albumazar,</hi> and also lady of the Ascendant, as here she
is, the common people, flutter like a Bee in a Tar-Box, and
by wranglings and contentions are like to vex the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to some tune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptolomie</hi> saith, if the Eclipse happen in Equinoctiall signes,
either in or ♈ or ♎ which this is one of them, the effects of
it will fall foul upon the Clergy, such of them as make a trade
of prateing nonsence instead of Gospell.</p>
               <p>By the rules of the Ancients, ♄ cannot be brought in as a
Lord of this Eclipse; for though hee bee anguler yet is hee
not stationary; yet shall I have something to say to him by
and by. Thus you have the first thing I promised you, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what Authors said of the effects of this Eclipse, passe wee
now to the second:</p>
               <p>Which is, What experience Authors that were dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were born, have left upon record of Eclipses of this
nature. I shal give you som few from <hi>Leovitius,</hi> and but few,
by reason the Press stays for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1418. the Sun was eclipsed in Aries 26 <hi>degr.</hi> in
<hi>Prague,</hi> in <hi>Pohemia</hi> the Clergy (as forsooth they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
and the Laity (as they please to call others) fell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the eares, the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> died of a Palsie, such
a fanaticall fury possest the Clergy in <hi>Paris,</hi> that their sawcy
actions caused two thousand of them to be knockt on the head
in the streets, in one day. Oh that they would once learn to
be a little wiser.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1419. hapned a dismall Eclipse of the Sun in Aries
15. Mars Lord of it in Taurus, as he is in this; Now follows
a new Tumult in <hi>Bohemia: Iohn Zizka</hi> a noble Soul of an
ingenious brain, and an excellent Souldier, gathers a great
Army, hee first enjoyes <hi>Bohemia,</hi> routs the Clergy in every
Battell, unthrones <hi>Sigismund</hi> the Emperor, and at last dies
in his Bed a Conqueror, after the Lord had made him a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
scourge to correct the proud insolency of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54723:24"/>The Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> and his Clergy went together by
the eares, which war continued Three years: But who gave
the Clergy authority to leave their Bible, and take a Sword;
no one breathing knows: sure 'twas Mars or the Devill, for
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whom they pretend they preach, is the PRINCE
of PEACE.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1486. happened a dreadfull Eclipse of the Sun in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
6. which set almost all <hi>Europe</hi> together by the eares, and
who were the authors of such a dissention think you, truly
the <hi>buffle-headed Clergy;</hi> for tis almost a miracle to finde an
evil in a Nation, and they not the Authors of it: the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
was that year taken Prisoner by the <hi>French,</hi> 'tis a strange
thing an Eclipse of the Sun seldom happens in Aries, but it
plagues the Roman Emperor. <hi>Caesars</hi> are but men, neither
shall Three yeares pass over your head, counting the time
from the 29. of <hi>March,</hi> 1652. but they shall find, and your
selves shal see they are no more. <hi>Anno</hi> 1530. There hapned
a great Eclipse of the Sun in ♈ 18. ♂ Lord of it neer the
Bulls eye, being a fixed Star of a hot and violent nature, and
the effects of this lasted until the spring time 1632. it seems
<hi>Leovitius</hi> followed not <hi>Ptolomies</hi> method concerning the
time, when the effects of an Eclipse began to operate: In
the beginning of the effects of this Eclips, the Bishops per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the <hi>Emperor</hi> to besiege <hi>Florence,</hi> which famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
after a long, tedious and starving siege was taken and
brought into bondage. <hi>Portugale</hi> was perplexed eight
daies together with Earthquakes about the midle of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it: after which terrifying Earthquakes succeeded as
terrible a Pestilence. I am almost of an opinion this Eclipse
1652. will shake down that new upstart <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which
revived but in the declining age of the world, like a lightning
before death, or the violent strugles of a dying man. About the
end of the effects of this Eclipse appeared a Comet, which run
through the <hi>Grab,</hi> the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and the <hi>Bullance,</hi> and did
a world of mischief; the <hi>Helvetians</hi> were got together by
the ears about Religion; the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> who had
been ten years banisht, prepares a Fleet, and makes a faint

assay to recover his Kingdome, but the poore man was taken
at Sea and comitted to safe custody; the <hi>Emperours</hi> son dies,
and the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> marches to his grave; the King of
<hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> is proclaimed <hi>Emperour,</hi> and to war
must he go against the Turkes before he had learned to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
a sword: but the world shall never say of him now he is
dead and rotten that he did nothing, for he beseiged a town
which lay upon the confines of <hi>Germany,</hi> and when he saw
the towne would not yeild and he was afraid to storme it, he
turned Retrograde. I will not shame him so much, to say he
run a way but the man seing he could not beat his enemies,
went to see what he could do against his friends, with fire &amp;
sword he wasted the greatest part both of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria:</hi>
at last, when he heard that the Christians had raised a
potent army against him, he being something a kin to <hi>prince
Rupert,</hi> loving plundering better then fighting, he and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
shift every man for themselves, leaving a name of ignomy
branded rather then ingraven upon his sepulcher, if ever he
were thought worthy of any.</p>
               <p>Anno 1540, hapned a great eclips of the Sunn in Aries 28.
a most parching hot and and dry summer followed, insomuch
that very deepe rivers were fordable, and rivers of a mean
bigness were utterly dried up: the very heat of the sun set fire
to woods, the Kings house in <hi>Bohemia</hi> was fired none knowes
how, frequent fires were all over <hi>Germany,</hi> the King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>
who is a branch of the <hi>house</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> died, the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Saxony</hi> takes his leave of this world, and turns private man
in another, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> beseiges <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> but insteed
of taking the towne, he lost his army first, and his life after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the <hi>Turke,</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> must needs be in armes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
and whither must he goe but to <hi>Algier,</hi> but there
comes a tempest and stops the mans course, a hundred and
thirty ships he lost, himselfe entered battle both with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the sea and hunger both at a time; at length when no
other good was to be don, he gathers up the reliques of his
forlorne creatures and returns home like a foole as he came
forth, and thus much for my second part, namely, what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54723:25"/>
of credit have left to posterity concerning the effects of
Eclipses of the Sun in Aries, upon which in civility you
cannot deny me that small curtesie, as to give my own ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions.</p>
               <p>First, you see here that the Priests have been the creatures
that have made all the scuffle in the world, in the effects of
these Eclipses; tis their turbulent spirits, and sophistical lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that caused so many mournful widows, and woful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless
children, so much murther and bloodshed in those
parts, where the effects of the Eclipses operated, he that
hath but half an eye may see what they have acted in this
Nation in these late unhappy wars; its in vain for them to
prate to me, that they never fight, as some of them have
said: there is a pretty fable in <hi>Esop,</hi> to this purpose; After
the winning of a battel, the conquering party took a Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prisoner, and when they would have executed him, he
prayed them for Gods sake they would not hang him, for he
never fought in all his life; but said they, thou cowardly
rascal, <hi>with thy Trumpet thou incitest others to fight.</hi> I leave
the Clergy of this Nation that are guilty of the business, to
make the moral themselves; tis easily done, <hi>Pilate</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
condemned Christ, had it not been for the <hi>Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi>
and <hi>Priests,</hi> but was almost forced by them to do it;
<hi>Pilate</hi> knew as well as I that he was guiltless; but being a
faint hearted base spirited fellow, and least he should be
thought not to be <hi>Caesars</hi> friend, crucified the Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
I pray God in these our daies, in which the end of the
world is coming, fellows of that jackcoat be not neer of kin
to the frogs men ioned in the Revelations 16. 13, 14. <hi>And I
saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of
the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the
mouth of the false Prophet, for they are the spirits of devils
working miraecles, which go forth unto the Kings of the Earth,
and of the Whole world, to gather them together to the battel of
that great day of God Almighty:</hi> look to it Priests, look to it
people, the time is a coming, and if you look not to it these
lines of mine shall one day leave you without excuse, build
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54723:25"/>
not your faith upon tradition; in the latter times it will be a
hard matter to discover who is a Saint &amp; who is not, even such
times in which if it were possible they would deceiv the elect,
if they could be deceived; the times will be sharp, they will be
short, &amp; for ought I know we are upon the beginings of them,
I would fain know of all our Priests, who (unless the Devil)
chained Divinity to an University, I hate such creatures, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
call them men, that when they have learned a great deal
of Sophistry, and know well how to quible handsomely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a point, and have read <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene,</hi>
and <hi>Bazil,</hi> and a great many other old Fathers,
then they say they have gotten the body of Divinity; truly,
I have read many of them my self, but could never see
Christ with such a pair of spectacles, the Theory of the
Gospel I know, tis onely <hi>Iesus Christ and him crucified,</hi> and
the <hi>indwelling of the spirit of God in man,</hi> but what the
practical part is I am as yet ignorant; my opinion at present
is, that tis something more plain and simple then the world
takes it to be; the main way to judge between a saint and a
sinner, is not who performs most duties; for our reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so much boasted of, consists rather in pulling down, then
setting up, &amp; this Eclipse was so placed by the Eternal God to
do it, &amp; it will execute the will of God in despite of all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisms
of all the Universities in the world: I honor learning
while it is in its Sphere: the fire is good while it is in the
Chimny corner, but put in the thatch, and it spoils all; and so
does learning in such men as pretend their natural gifts to
come by divine inspiration, learning will make one a man of
a beast, but not a saint of a man; and yet the most part of
men think that the Gospel rests only in the heads of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and humane learning is deified and made a little god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almighty
of, as though the Gospel were so chained to human
leaning, that it could not be separated: I am none of those
that count humane learning evil, but know, and by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
finde, it is an excellent ornament to a man, it makes a
man the more a man; and therefore a saint that hath hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
learning, is better able to express Christ, then he which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54723:26"/>
is a saint and hath none, because he is more a man, but he is
never the fitter nor abler to receive Christ.</p>
               <p>In the second place we finde in all these examples, that the
<hi>Emperors</hi> &amp; whole house of <hi>Austria</hi> hath bin much afflicted,
let them look to it: now <hi>Bohemia</hi> will probably be afflicted
with intestine wars: the <hi>Emperor</hi> at his wits end, his house
totters, and tis in vain for him to prop it up by Armies, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing else, mens lives are but like so many ships sailing to
their long homes, which should be towards heaven: tis in
vain to prop up a ship when it totters, with posts without
side, tis the ballast within must keep it steedy: and let me
give this sober advise to the forraign Princes of that ancient
Family, tis a principle of goodness within you, and not the
strength of Armies without you must do you good in these
times which so neerly concern you.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let Christian Princes beware of warring with the
<hi>Turk</hi> during the effects of this Eclipse: you have read alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
how fatal it hath been to you in former ages: the time of
his fall is not yet come, although fall he must: neither hath
the Eternal ordained any of you to pull down that proud
Monarchy.</p>
               <p>I should now come to deliver my own judgment upon the
effects of this Eclipse: but here is an Objection seems worth
the answering, namely, Why did not the Eclipse of the Sun in
Aries 19. 1633. work so great effects as you Prognosticate
in this. To this I Answer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, the Eclipse was not so great, therefore not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable:</hi>
The greatness of the effects of an Eclipse of the
Sun, are drawn from the greatness of the parts of the body
of the Sun darkned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the house of the heavens afflicted by that Eclipse
was obscure, therefore so must the effects be, and yet what
sad effects it produced is well known throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi>
it being not past our memory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ♃ and ♀ were both in the ninth house, and
therefore moderated the matter by wisdom, and good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54723:26"/>Fourthly, the last, though not the least of all my arguments
is, matters were not then fit nor ripe for action; so then there
is as much difference between that eclips and this, as there is
between fire set among corn when it is green, and when it is
dry.</p>
               <p>I com to my last thing propounded, which is my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
rationally delivered from the Scheam: and in doing of
this I shall be as accurate as I can.</p>
               <p>The fixed Stars with which this eclipse happens, are of a
Saturnine and Mercuriall condition (I mean those that are
within the Zodiack, for I have nothing to say to the rest now)
the second paper wil shew you what their condition is, to that
I refer you, as not daring to write in words of length, and
not of figures, what I think; when <hi>Iuvenall</hi> was in the same
fear he wrote his <hi>Satyrs</hi> against such as were dead; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
my self this Nation is ful of Criticks, I wil give my self
the latitude of all <hi>Europe</hi> in my Prognostications: the mid-Heaven
signifies Kings, Magistrates, &amp;c. the Ascendant the
common people; the place of the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Iupiter</hi> last past, was in the mid-heaven of this Eclips, perhaps
so was the conjunction in the mid-heaven of the figure: the
<hi>Moon</hi> is Lady of the ascendant, and darkens the Sunne in the
10th. upon the very degree of his exaltation: and if this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
not a <hi>Democracy,</hi> or to write English, That the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall come into the hands of the People, and that
throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> or the most part therof, before the effects
of this Eclipse are over past, I dare bee bound to forfeit my
Life: and yet this great thing shall not be done easily: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I speak more of this hereafter, yet a few words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
here in due season will not be amiss: <hi>Saturn</hi> perplexes
the Ascendant, and if the Ascendant signifie the comon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it perplexes them also.</p>
               <p>Its no great miracle if Magistrates be perplexed: that the
Vulgar should suffer: when the Lion roars, the beasts tremble.
Two years shall not pass before both come to pass. <hi>Saturn</hi>
in the ascendant according to <hi>Bally,</hi> and there unfortunate,
and the old soul is as misfortunate as can bee; signifies detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54723:27"/>
and impediment to the Body of man, infirmities and
sickness of his own nature: the truth on't is, he looks as sowr
as Verjuice on the common People; and to tell them the
plain truth of the business, hee is Lord of the seventh, eighth
and ninth Houses. Have a care of your selves gentle Clergy,
and be ruled by me, joyn together and petition the State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his effects, and tell them ITS DAMNABLE, ITS
DAMNABLE. See if you and the States are able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his evill influence. I will promise you, the States have
patience enough to stay two years to try which is in the truth,
you or I. It were a most gallant thing, my Friends of the
Clergy, if your outcryes and most humble petitions, could
withstand the influence of the Stars, which the eternall God,
the first Being of all things created them for.</p>
               <p>A word or two to my Brethren of the Commonalty, my
self being a Commoner: Good people, I cannot flatter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I perswade my self you will act honestly during the
effects of this eclipse. I speak not to those in <hi>England,</hi> but
generally to all those in <hi>Europe,</hi> horrid Tumults, Murthers
and Mutinies are threatned, cruel massacres; the Commoners
are subject to bee impudent and insolent against their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates:
remember, remember <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was ruined by its
own seditions within it, or else <hi>Vespasian</hi> had as good have
thrown his cap at it. Let us reason a little together in a fair
way; I pray tell mee, and tell mee truly, suppose your Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
doe not please you, is Mutinies the way to help your
selves? would you take such a courswel at the hands of your
servants? would you be glad to be served so? read all Histories
and see if you can ever finde any good end ensue such prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
beginnings; you will undo your selvs and begger your
children and families if you take such courses, God will have
his work don in his own time, by his own way, of which I am
sure Mutiny is none. And yet the more is the pity, they are
too too frequent throughout <hi>Europe;</hi> I pray God <hi>England</hi>
bee not too too sensible of them during the effects of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
I say no more. I am sure <hi>France</hi> is peppered with them,
and <hi>Holland</hi> hath its share.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:54723:27"/>The square of <hi>Saturn</hi> to the Luminaries, signifies wrangling
and falling out between great and rich men: Kings and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
cannot agree with one another; so it seemes the comon
people shall not have all the fish to fry, Negligence and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
having taken possession of Princes; Envy, hatred and
accusations by the people, and somthing wors sues and pursues
them, and like so many evil Spirits haunts their Ghosts, and at
last unthrones them, and layes their honor in the dust: And
where can come a better place for that counsell of the Holy
Ghost, then this: <hi>Be wise now therefore O ye Kings, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
ye Rulers of the Earth; serve the Lord with fear and
rejoyce with trembling: kisse the Son lest he be angry, and ye
perish from the way: Blessed are all they that trust in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>Saturn</hi> being Lord of the Eight, and in the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
threatens the Earth with diseases of his owne nature,
which you may read in my <hi>Semeiotica,</hi> &amp; I doubt feel before
the effects of this Eclipse be half over. The truth is, a general
pestilence is threatened to <hi>Europe,</hi> of which <hi>England</hi> is like
sadly to participate, neither shall <hi>Holland</hi> want its share.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, consider that the places subject to the effects of this

Brain, say I am no Artist; Men shall wonderfully be given
to lying and deceiving, they know not what they would have,
their thoughts are in a Chaos, and hang together like ropes
of sand, their thoughts dance up and down from one thing
to another without any order: so that if they would look
upon them with the eye of Reason, they begin without order
and end without issue: we may say of mens dispositions about
this time, as <hi>Seneca</hi> said of mens lives, <hi>They are tossed much,
but sail nothing;</hi> and truly, this is a very shrewd Disease, the
only true cure that I at present know for it, is to observe the
vanity of your owne dispositions. What a vaine thing is it,
That a man whose Birth and breeding hath made him but a
a Bramble, never to rule over the Trees, should offer to turne
Statesman, or except against the government he cannot mend;
<hi>Thomaso Masianello</hi> the <hi>Fisherman</hi> did so at <hi>Naples,</hi> to his
own destruction, and the City also: Truly, I had not given
you so many cautions, had I not been confident, That about
this time your Wits be too subject to runn a wooll-gathering
to their own destruction.</p>
                  <p>Besides <hi>Guido</hi> saith, That the conjunction of <hi>Sol</hi> &amp; <hi>Saturn</hi>
in <hi>Leo,</hi> maketh children disobedient, and act things cleane
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54723:29"/>
contrary to their Parents will: They say that <hi>Gemini</hi> is the
Ascendant of <hi>London;</hi> and yet this we finde by experience,
That <hi>Saturn</hi> never came into <hi>Leo</hi> but he punisheth this City;
let her Magistrates and Common-councel-men avoid perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Counsels and Debates about this time: I am very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
if God do not immediately contradict the influence of
the Heavens about this time, such a thing, or such a like thing
may be; and perhaps something worse, if some be not wiser
then some, there be those now living that will have occasion
to temember <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September</hi> 1652. so long as they
have a day to live.</p>

                  <p>The next that cometh in order is the ☌ of ♄ and ♂ in ♌ 5.
<hi>August</hi> 9. 1652. the effects of which I tremble to think of,
and willingly would have past them by if I durst; the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be great, and I pray God the desart be not as
great; and that I may be methodical in the handling of it,
I will bring to your memory,</p>
                  <p>First, what hath formerly succeeded such a ☌, and yet
within our age.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what Authors say of such a conjunction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, my own judgement on it.</p>
                  <p>To the first of these I shall quote but onely one Example,
which ushered the late King <hi>Charles</hi> to the Crown: 1622.
in <hi>Iuly</hi> happened a conjunction of ♄ and ♂ in ♋, which
though it be a little out of my road, maketh not a little to
my purpose: during the effects of this conjunction, <hi>London</hi>
was afflicted with an Epidemical disease in the belly; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same disease, which lately puzled all our pittiful Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to finde out what it was, and caused by the very same
aspect, namely, a ☌ of ♄ and ♂ in ♋. I cannot conceive it
can appear a wonder to any real Physitian, that knoweth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what foundation the ground of his Art is built; but that
so great affliction of Saturne in a moist sign, should marre
the attentive faculty in man; but though they had not wit
enough to finde out the cause of the disease; yet they had
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54723:30"/>
wit enough to invent a hideous name for it. <hi>viz.</hi> the plague
in the guts; I had not mentioned this, had it not been to
have done a little good to my Country-men; if ever it be
their hard hap to be troubled with such a Colledge puzling
disease, tis but onely strengthening the retentive faculty,
and the cure is done, that so you need not puzle nature to
encounter with a virulent disease and preposterous physick
at the same time, but enough of this. To proceed,</p>
                  <p>Under the effects of this conjunction of ♄ and ♂ <hi>Anno</hi>
1623. the Sea broak in at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> as I have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
informed by those that lived there at that time, and
now in the very same place it brake in the last time: I would
not say this is a strong confirmation of the truth in Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
for fear the Priests should rail at it; yet this I say, what
is here written is truth, and if that truth which is most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
is most excellent; take this into that number;
and now wherefore do you think I have quoted all this, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make way for what followes.</p>
                  <p>If the effects of the ☌ of ♄ and ♂ in ♋. 1622. jumpe so
exactly with the effects of the ☌ of ♄ and ♂ in ♋. 1650. as
they did as near as the men of <hi>Benjamin</hi> could sling a stone;
Why should not the effects of the ☌ of ♄ and ♂ in ♌ 1652:
answer as exactly to the ☌ of ♄ and ♂ in ♌ 1624. The sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
1624, was exceeding dry, and was it not so 1651. the
summer 1625. was exceeding pestilential, and if the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God do not prevent, the influence of the heavens threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
no less in 1653. let such as question the truth of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
consider of this, and indeed for their sakes I quoted it,
I am confident many moderate souls are possest with a
PRIEST RIDDEN HUMOUR, that they suppose
whatever a Priest prates in a Pulpit must needs be true, and
for truth they entertaine it without any examination, it is
a hundred pitties the men of BEREA are dead, and
none of their generation living in <hi>England,</hi> whom the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost commends for searching the Scriptures to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> taught were true or not, but
our Ministers <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> serves the turns of most of their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54723:30"/>
hearers, though their spirits comes as far short of <hi>Paul's,</hi>
as the spirit of a Hare doth from the spirit of a Lion: and
thus you have the first thing propounded. <hi>viz</hi> What
hath succeeded such a ☌ in our age, and also the reasons, why
I did it.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we now to the second: What the opinions of
Authors is of such a malevolent ☌ as this is, and I care not
greatly if I begin with <hi>Haly;</hi> the ☌ of ♄ and ♂ causeth
<hi>impediment to</hi> Kings, <hi>diseases amongst men, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in a fiery sign, they must needs proceed from heat of
blood; men first of all deceive one another, and afterwards
fall out and fight</hi> (and so let such creatures do, till I part
them) <hi>men are subject to hot Rhumes in their eyes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to</hi> Guido; especially their right eyes; fire and sword,
and sudden death, and another inconvenience from their
<hi>Geniu's,</hi> their heads are not set fast enough upon their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
besides, the ☌ happening in ♌, a fixed signe, the
mischief is like to be durable, ah, and violent too, both the
stars being violent, and the sign no less, the malice must needs
be much increased, unless Jupiter help, and the poor soul is
so weak he cannot. The hast of the Printer, or something
else, hinders me from quoting more Authors.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the third thing proposed, and that is
my own judgement; and herein I might well say as the
Priest did in the Pulpit, I know not where to begin, nor
where to end, but I must begin somewhere, or else I shall
shame my self, and confound my Auditors; if this do not
argue simplicity in me to recite in a book, I am sure it did in
the Priest to recite it in a Pulpit; well then, I will let it stand
for a jest: and thus I'll begin.</p>
                  <p>First, Never yet happened a ☌ in Saturne and Mars in ♌,
but it punished <hi>London</hi> with a Pestilence the next year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and now they make two ☌ in ♌, one in 1652. ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in 1654. what harm is it, if I bid <hi>London</hi> beware of a
Pestilence, in 1653. and 1655. though it should never
come to pass, is the City ever the worse? Or the Citizens
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54723:31"/>
e'er the poorer; I am confident it hath held true, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by Chronicle, these five hundred years: <hi>The merciful God
whose tender mercy is over all his works, grant in mercy to his
poor and almost undone Nation, that it may take away our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors
only, and spare such as mind and intend really the good
of the Commonalty:</hi> And if I might make an Allegory of
one place of Scripture, which though it were really in the
letter once verified, it followes not in the least, but it may in
a mistical sense be performed once again, it follows not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God said, <hi>Genesis 3.15. I will put enmity between thee
and the serpent, and between thy seed and her seed,</hi> &amp;c.
That all the Enmity between them, should be onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
men and serpents, greater enmity then which is not
between two creatures, for men though they keep beasts for
their profit, and birds for their pleasure, and dormice for
their ease, as to make themselves sleep, or the like: yet a
man when he meets with an Adder, gives him no quarter,
but is sure to die for it; and where tis said in the foregoing
Scripture: <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman:</hi>
and it is quoted in <hi>Plinies Natural History;</hi> and I am
much mistaken if the same thing be not in <hi>Gesners</hi> History
of <hi>Beasts,</hi> that if a serpent be put into a room where there
is forty men, and but one woman, the serpent will single
out that woman amongst all them men, to do her a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:
I say doth it follow because this Scripture holds so
true in a litteral sense, may it not hold as true in a mistical
sense, and produce a real war.</p>
                  <p>First, in the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> or body of man, between the
spirit of man and his own corruptions, look into your selves
you shall finde it as I tell you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the habitable world between the saints
and the men whose portions is in this world; which <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abel</hi> first began: but the contest shall never be ended
till the dissolution.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the intelligible world between good and
bad Angels; for <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels shall fight against
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54723:31"/>
the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> shall fight and his Angels:
but here is our comfort, and the comfort of all saints, our
<hi>Christ</hi> is a <hi>Conquering Christ,</hi> and is preparing to <hi>ride out
Conquering and to Conquer,</hi> and if this be so, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
true, why may not another Scripture? 1 <hi>Kings 19.
15, 16, 17. And the Lord said unto him go, and return on
thy way to the Wilderness of</hi> Damascus, <hi>and when thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
there, anoint</hi> Hazael <hi>to be King over</hi> Syria, <hi>and</hi> Jehu
<hi>the son of</hi> Nimshy, <hi>shalt thou anoint to be King over</hi> Israel,
<hi>and</hi> Elisha <hi>the son of</hi> Shaphat <hi>of</hi> Abel-meholah <hi>shalt thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
to be Prophet in thy room; and it shall come to pass, that
him that escapeth the sword of</hi> Hazael, <hi>shall</hi> Jehu <hi>slay, and
him that escapeth the swood of</hi> Jehu <hi>shall</hi> Elisha <hi>slay,</hi> and I
care not greatly if I ad the next verse; <hi>yet have I left me
seven thousand in</hi> Israel, <hi>that have not bowed the knee to</hi> Baal;
I will not stand much in the interpretation of this Scripture,
but leave every one to be his own interpreter: yet this I
say, that Tyranical brain who hath escaped the sword in this
Nation, may dye by the pestilence; and he who escapeth
the pestilence, may dye by the hand of that Angel who is
noted to come, <hi>Revelations 14. 6, 7. And I saw an Angel
fly in the midst of Heaven having the</hi> EVERLASTING
GOSPEL <hi>to preach to them that dwel on the Earth, and to
every Nation, and tongue, and people; saying with a loud
voice, fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his
judgment is come, and worship him that made the Heaven and
Earth, and the Sea; which Angel I assure you is coming,
and will be heard, not in your ears, but in your hearts; I
mean the hearts of such as have not bowed</hi> THEIR KNEE
TO BAAL: And this gives me some hope the Lord will
preserve you in this terrible pestilential time 1653. in the
mean season make use of <hi>Paul's</hi> advice which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Lystra: Turn from vanity, and worship the living
God which made the Earth and the Sea and all that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Kings and Magistrates cannot agree with one
another, but only in one thing, and that is oppressing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54723:32"/>
and that they are old dogs at, and the poor groan under
it, <hi>Arise O God and help them!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Soldiery canot agree with one another, let them
score their valor on the heads of their enemies in Gods name,
and not fall out with one another for that is pity.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, many Clergymen and Lawyers are displaced and
imprisoned, and some made shorter by the head.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, a new sect of Hereticks arise, and yet I should admire
how wors can be invented then are already, did I not know
the Devils invention is very quick in what is nought.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, a wofull mortality is threatned both to man and
beast, pestilence amongst men, diseases of the heart and
stomack, murrain among cattell, violent hot and blasting East
winds.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, I could almost be afraid of some treacherous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either hatching or acting by those that are in authority
in <hi>Scotland:</hi> I hope our State will have a vigilant eye over
them, they have warning of it long enough before hand.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Cholar perplexes the bodies of men, to which
if I adde a little discontent, as I may doe very well, both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
through the Limbick of an idle Brain, may bring forth
such an untoward chymicall preparation, as may produce
contempt of Authority, to the great prejudice both of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
in the Nation, and also in the Nation it self.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, private Murthers and poisonings are like to bee
very rife, I desire all men in authority to have a care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
lest some of them be sent to take a supper <hi>apud inferos,</hi>
before they are aware of it; it is a scurvy fashion, I doe not
like it, and yet to tell you the truth I fear it.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, the Land is not like to beare all the evill influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this conjunction, the Sea must have his share also;
there is like to be old knocking there, our Frigots I hope are
like to get good prizes, let the <hi>Hollander</hi> beware how hee
meddles with us, untill such time as he longs to be beaten, I
am of opinion that most of the Merchants of <hi>Europe</hi> will com
off losers in the effects of this conjunction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:54723:32"/>
11. Religion is much controverted and that by such as
know neither what it is, nor what they would have: God
grant they make not a <hi>Deformation</hi> instead of a <hi>Reformation,</hi>
and the common People love the Law and the Hang-man
much alike; neither can they forbear quarelling even with
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>France</hi> is as full of tumults as an egg is full of meat, od
conceited tumults without either sense or reason: <hi>Cardinall
Mazarine</hi> his brains are like to bee knockt out in an uproar
or else poysoned: and if the King himself scape, 'tis more then
I look for: Many parts in <hi>Italy</hi> are like to speed no better:
you may know what the evill effects of such disordered Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
are, by the late sufferings of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. English brains are very discontented; neither are they
all troubled with one discontent: happy is that man, that
findes another man of his own judgement. The Souldier stands
stoutly to his principles; 'tis pitty there is not a School to
teach men Patience, such a pannick fear possesses the hearts of
the Vulgar, and such multitudes of Ghostly thoughts they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
up, that at last they runne away pursued by nothing but
by their own fears: The Winter following, men and women
will bee mighty subject to quartane Agues. And thus much
for this Conjunction, and also for this part.</p>

                  <p>Passe wee now to the Lords of the Eclips, which are ♃ and
♂, ♃ is placed in the mid-heaven in ♑, where hee threatens
a change of Government, a change of the Laws and customes

                  <p>
                     <hi>Albumazar</hi> saith, It signifies the death of noble men. The

in my judgement upon the Eclips of the Sun; only wee shall
have something to say to him here, as considered in the sixth
house, and in the <hi>Lion.</hi> ♂ Lord of the Eclips in ♌ signifies
<hi>death of four-footed Beasts; causeth great diseases of heat amongst
Men; stirs up heat of ayre, and makes men as quarrelsome as

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the oppositions of ♄ and ♃.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>You may remember we told you before, that ♄ and ♃ made
three oppositions during the effects of this Eclipse, and all
three of them from ♌ and ♒; the first happens in the yeer
1652/3. <hi>Febr.</hi> 27. 0<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. 3'0. p.m. in 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of ♌ and ♒.</p>

                  <p>And the last happens in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1653/4. the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day about 8.
in the morning, in 24<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of ♌ and ♒, ♄ being with <hi>cor,</hi> ♌ and
♃ with <hi>fomahand,</hi> I shall here speak of them all together, and
in so doing, first Ile shew you what Authours have left to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
upon the like oppositions. Secondly, the judgement
of Authours upon the effects of them. Thirdly, my own
judgement upon them.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the first of these, namely, What Authors
have left upon Record, to have succeeded such oppositions,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1433. in <hi>Sept.</hi> there was an ☍ of ♄ and ♃ from ♌ and
♒ 13. ♂ joynes with ♄ in <hi>November,</hi> and opposeth ♃. <hi>Anno</hi>
1434 ♄ and ♃ make another ☍ in the latter end of ♌ and ♒,
about which time appeared a terryfying Comet; and so there
may doe now too for ought I know, or else other sights in the
aire as bad.</p>
                  <p>Also <hi>Anno</hi> 1633. there happened a terrible Eclyps of
the ☉ in the <hi>crab,</hi> which shewed his influence to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the yeere following; and now judge whether it bee not
to some purpose to quote this example, there being such an
admirable congruity betweene those and these oppositions;
only the Eclyps of the ☉ was in the <hi>crab</hi> then, and in the <hi>ram</hi>
now, and that an ☍ of ♄ and ♃, ♄ being in ♌, might never
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54723:34"/>
bee said to come without having one touch at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to

by Chronicle, that ever the tumbling &amp; tossing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of ♄ through the <hi>Lyon</hi> hapned, but it was a sufficient scourg

                     </hi> made Warre against his <hi>holynes</hi> the <hi>Pope,
Anno</hi> 1434. who seeing himselfe not able to resist, his Gutts
and he ran away, and he was glad at heart he could escape so:
A generall. Councell was held at <hi>Bazile,</hi> at which his <hi>holines</hi>
the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> permitted the <hi>Bohemians</hi> to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
in both kindes, whereas both before and since, the
Priests drinke up all the Wine themselves, and leave the poore
people ready to choake themselves with the breaden-god.</p>
                  <p>When those Princes wee told you of before, had routed
the Pope out of his holy-Chayre, like a company of Asses,
they goe together by the eares with one another; the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
dyeth, and <hi>Albert, Arch-Duke</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> is made
<hi>Emperour,</hi> but hee held it but a small time, Death sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
him to make his appearance in another world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1493. was another opposition of Saturne and Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in ♌ and ♒ an Eclyps of the ☉ in ♉ then operating. The
<hi>Romane Empyre</hi> is together by the Eares, whole Heards of
Cattle dye of the Murraine; The King of <hi>Portingall</hi> falls off
of his Horse and breaks his neck; now the <hi>Emperour</hi> dyes, and
that veneriall disease (though called the <hi>French-Pox</hi>) began
first in <hi>Naples;</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> is full of trouble, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
quits the Field; the King of <hi>Poland</hi> is beaten by the <hi>Turk;</hi>
presently after this, as there doth now, hapned an Eclypse of
the ☉ in ♌, which though it were but small, yet were the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
great, by reason the luminary was infested with the squares
both of ♄ and ♂: Good Lord have mercy upon us! what will
the effects of this next Eclips in ♌ be, when the Eclips it selfe is
great, and the luminaries <hi>besieged</hi> by the bodies of ♄ and ♂?
The Death of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and also of many <hi>Germane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Princes</hi>
succeeded in the effects of this. <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
another ☍ of ♄ and ♃ in ♌ and ♒, an Eclyps of the ☉ in
♑ then stoutly operating, <hi>Caesare</hi> is at wars, the Bishops of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54723:34"/>
                     <hi>Germany</hi> are together by the Eares, so was the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and the King of <hi>France;</hi> I had not mentioned this ☍ had
not <hi>Edward,</hi> the last of that name, King of <hi>England,</hi> a most
hopefull young man changed this life for a better; hee had the
<hi>Virgin</hi> in the <hi>Horoscope</hi> of his <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the ☉ Eclipsed neer
the degree ascending, and in the place of ♄: Warrs followed
his death; and Religion mended just as sowre Ale doth
in Summer. The <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> must needs goe
fight with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brunswick:</hi> one battell hee gave him,
and was handsomely beaten for his pains: As soon as ever he
could get another Army hee must have the other bout with
him, and was served the same sauce: the yeer after this great
☍ <hi>England</hi> was as full of troubles as the Sea is full of water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wyat</hi> Rebelled about the comming in of <hi>Phillip King</hi> of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and many more were clapt up in the Goal, right or
wrong, it matters not: <hi>Guilford Dudly</hi> and his wife <hi>Ioane,</hi> the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and his <hi>Daughter</hi> lost their heads: The <hi>Lady
Elizabeth</hi> was clapt up in Prison; and <hi>Mary</hi> Rules the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more like a Beast then a woman: I must transgres no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in quoting what is past, but come to what Authors say of
the ☍, which is the second thing promised.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haly</hi> faith, The ☍ of ♄ and ♃ signifies many brawlings and
contentions, both between man and man, and between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Nation; sets the Commonalty together by the ears
against their Magistrates and Kings. Besides, according to
<hi>Guido,</hi> It signifies that Kings and Magistrates shall bee depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
especially such whose Kingdomes are under ♌ and ♒; Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thereunder shall bee consumed by Fire and Sword. Also,
besides all this, <hi>Albumazar</hi> saith, That rich men shall be made
equall with the poor.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>De Malé quaesitis vix gaudet tertius Haeres.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>Goods ill got soon scatter'd bee,</l>
                     <l>The third Heir ne'er doth them see.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>I come now to the third, which is my own judgement upon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54723:35"/>
the Oppositions, in which I shall bee very brief.</p>
                  <p>First, They signifie consumption of estate; let no thriving
time (I mean, no time to grow exceeding rich) bee expected
by English men yet these four or five yeers; God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
other Fish for them to fry, his determination upon
the world is otherwise: <hi>Ier.</hi> 45. 4, 5. <hi>Iehovah saith thus:
Behold, that which I have built will I break down; and that
which I have planted I will pluck up; even this whole land: And
seekest thou great things for thy self? seek them not: for behold,
I will bring evill upon all flesh, saith the Lord; but thy life will
I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.</hi> I hope
such as fear God, and aime at the liberty of the Subject, shall
have <hi>Baruchs</hi> promise made good to them; and let them
thank God if they scape so too: and if they please to heare me,
well and good; if not, I have my reward: God is a bringing
to passe a great work in the world, which when you see it
come to passe, it will make your hearts ake; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
I can give you some reasons why hee doth so, for the
God of reason doth nothing without reason, and if wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see a reason of Gods actions, 'tis to bee imputed to our
blindnesse; let the Priests prate what they will <hi>The Saints are
united to the God-head, by the person of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi>
Some of the Reasons may probably be these, or if you will not
take them for reasons, take them for probable conjectures, 'tis
no matter under what notion you take them, so you make
good use of them.</p>
                  <p>First, one Reason may be to prepare the Saints for such Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as hee will shortly reveale to them; <hi>Whilest the Bridegroom
staied the wise Virgins, as well as the foolish, slumbred and slept;</hi>
and in all probabilities these dreadfull times are but to awake
them out of that sleepe; consider how unfit the best of Saints
are to receive those wonderfull things which God will short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reveale to them; if they please I'll draw them up a
looking-glasse to behold a copy of their Countenances in, as
they stand <hi>in statu quo,</hi> as their Disposition is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>First, they minde riches much, and send their Hearts to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54723:35"/>
meete them before they come; they draw Maps of their own
desires, and cut out such a kinde of life in their thoughts as
pleases them, and by their owne thoughts put themselves into
another condition then God hath ordained for them; as
children, to exercise their houswifery, make clay-pies; and
to expresse their desires make Babies of clouts; neither is there
any better way for a man to know his owne heart then this,
for though a mans condition bee not as hee would have it, and
let the impossibilities or improbabilities bee never so great of
being what they desire, yet their fancies will discover to them
what their inclinations are, they will create a fooles Paradice
in their own Brains; First what they would be. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what they would doe if they were so; and when they have
created such a Paradise, then they walke up and downe in it
with delight; First, how much money they would have. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what they would doe with it; what preferment they
would have, and then how they would carry themselves in it,
and though they want the things themselves they desire, yet
will they please themselves with the Pictures of them drawne
in their thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I make no question but the Saints are guilty of
sinns as well as other men, and delight to busie their time in
thinking of those things that nothing at all concerns them;
they long after curiosities, like Women with childe, that many
times long for such things as cannot bee had: our thoughts
are the buds of an immortall nature whithin us, and ought to
bee spent about such things as are discovered in the works and
word of God, and not to be spent about the idle <hi>Idea's</hi> of our
own brains: What a madnesse were it for a Lady, instead of
<hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>Diamonds,</hi> to dresse her self up with <hi>Peacocks fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
and yet our thoughts, as familiarly as the Sun rises and
sets, instead of feeding upon wholesome food, contained in the
<hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> like <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melions,</hi>
they feed on the aire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Their thoughts are spent in meditating of what is
upon Earth, and not of what is in Heaven; and taking a survey
of worldly hapinesse, which they enjoy, as <hi>Haman</hi> was taking
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54723:36"/>
an inventory of his glory the night before hee was hanged,
and <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> when hee was walking alone and talking
to himself like a fool, <hi>Is not this great Babel that I have built?</hi>
even at the very time when hee was taken with a <hi>Lycanthropia;</hi>
for as men which desire alwaies to bee telling their money, 'tis
a signe they are covetous; and women that alwaies delight
to bee looking their faces in a looking Glasse, 'tis a signe they
are proud: so men that are alwaies minding their earthly
happinesse, and forget to bee thankfull to God, shews infinite
pride and self flattery in them; therefore they shall have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the flesh that God may call them off from it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Take a man that is ambitious, and so 'tis to bee
feared are some of the best of men, though they cannot yet
obtain what they desire, yet will they, feigning themselves to
bee some great persons, and having erected a throne in their
own brains, sit down very quietly in it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, A man that loves his guts well, and wants money
to purchase such food as hee desires, will please himself with
the delights of what hee would have, hee will set down within
his own brain a bill of fare and what ingredients hee will have
in it, and please himself with the conceit of it, although hee
have none of it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, A man that is revengefull, and wants a sting, hee
will please himself with his own revengfull thoughts, and take
delight to conceit hee is plagueing his enemie, though hee bee
twenty miles from him.</p>
                  <p>I am confident, if you look into your own conditions, you
shall finde I have hit the nayle on the head in some of these;
and then you cannot but see a reason of the troublesomenesse
of the times, before the comming of the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in
power. This is my first reason.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Devill begins to grow a little troublesome,
because hee hath but a short time to continue, as the <hi>Bishops</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> were in the height of their pride before they fell,
as <hi>Monarchy</hi> was most tyrannicall a little before its <hi>Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe:</hi>
So will the Devill also, if you beleeve the Scripture,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Woe bee to the Inhabitants of the earth, and of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54723:36"/>
sea, for the Divel is come down to you, having great wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knows he hath but a short time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. God may do it to leave the wicked without excuse:
They have read, all these things shall come before the great
and notable day of the Lord appear, before he pour out his
spirit upon all flesh; and if they will neither beleeve what
they read, hear, see, nor feel, I do not know what to say to
them; As sure as a club, their consciences cannot plead one
inch of excuse.</p>
                  <p>4. God may do it, to make the Saints attend more to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
When men are most in danger, then they pray hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyest,
and walk closest with God; when they have a little
rest, God is quickly out of their minds. And now I think
of it, I care not if I incite here a couple of Verses which I
heard from a Commander now at present in the Army;
<q>
                        <l>Our God and Souldiers we alike adore,</l>
                        <l>Even in the brink of danger, not before.</l>
                        <l>After deliv'rance they are alike requited,</l>
                        <l>Our God's forgotten, and our Souldiers slighted.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to tell you the truth, Experience will tell us, that in
that persecution under the late <hi>Bishops,</hi> the Saints walked
more closely with God then now they do; they now walk
as carelesly, as if the Divel were dead. I shall bring all home
to the purpose I quoted it for, and conclude this reason with
one place of Scripture; which, when you have read and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
considered, tell me if <hi>prayer</hi> may not be a notable
help to you in these times of trouble which are so manifestly
threatned, and so near at hand, and so nearly concern you;
it is <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 19, 20, 21. <hi>And I will shew wonders in heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and signes in the earth beneath: bloud, and fire, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
of smoake: The Sun shall be turned into darknesse, and
the Moon into blood, before that great and not able day of the
Lord come. And it shall come to passe, that whosoever shall</hi>
CALL <hi>upon the</hi> NAME <hi>of the</hi> LORD <hi>shall be saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. It may be to call off the hearts of the Saints from the
world, that so they may look up to God whether they will
or no: when nothing but trouble is to be seen under the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54723:37"/>
Moon, such may the love of God to the Saints be, that he
may move them to come to him by arguments of necessity.
This is my first Axiome.</p>
                  <p>2 Magistrates walk in the clouds, neither will what the
common people intend, quickly be known. Religion in one
place, and execution of justice in another, will be made a
couple of dainty cloaks to hide mens knaveries; (<hi>i.e.</hi> cover
ambitious thoughts from the vulgar view;) <hi>frigidus latet
anguis in herba:</hi> have a care you be not deceived that way;
nay, have a double care, such as pretend your freedom and
liberty, bring you not into a worse bondage. A seasonable
warning is given you of it, not onely by the book of the
Creatures, but also by the book of the Scriptures, <hi>Micah 7.
5, 6, 7. Trust yee not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a
guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy
bosome: for the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth
up against her mother, the daughter in law against the mother
in law; a mans enemies are the men of his own house: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
My God will hear me.</hi> Here is your disease, here is
your cure; the Scripture hath spoke enough, I need speak
no more.</p>
                  <p>3. We told you before, That a murrein amongst beasts
was threatned: and as amongst men in a pestilentiall time,
all that are infected die not, neither is it probable will all the
beasts; therefore men eating such corrupted food, taking
their nourishment from it, must needs be defiled by its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity.
And if you will give me leave to digress a little, I
will not transgress.</p>
                  <p>First, Hereby ye see, what a great part of the curse of God
for sin was: Happy, yea thrice happy is hee to whom God
reveals a redresse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By this you may see, if you be not stark blind,
which takes a more laudable course to cure a disease, <hi>Gailen,</hi>
who gives the medicine with its impurity; or <hi>Paracelsus,</hi>
who substracts onely the medicinal part, and leaves the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,
as <hi>terra damnata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:54723:37"/>
4. Violent storms, and unusuall, if not unheard of hail
will be a great prejudice unto the earth, especially toward the
later end of the Summer 1652, 1653, and its well if 1654
scape.</p>
                  <p>5. When the air is thus troubled, the spirits of the air
must needs be troubled also; men conceive strange, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thoughts of the Divel, namely, that he is an ugly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoth
creature, with horns on his head, and cloven feet, with
great eys like sacers: others that have a little more wit, know
wel enough that he is a spirit; but they think he is tied up
fast enough, either in hell, or in some other hole, neither I
nor they know where; when the truth is, his residence is in
the air; and therefore the Scripture calleth him, <hi>The Prince
of the power of the air.</hi> Therefore I say, the air being disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the spirits of the air must needs be disturbed also; and
such unusual sights may appear, as may terrifie both your eys
and hearts, if not at the time of the Eclipse, yet within a short
time after: Neither shall you see the midst of <hi>August</hi> 1652
over-past, but the world shall see what I have written is
truth.</p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>Iew</hi> begins to take a spleen at <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the
Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> begin to snarl at her; her finall Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe
approacheth, but not yet. However, till that time come,
continuall sicknesses, fires, and tumults; either one of these,
or all of these, or something else as bad, will molest her:
And if her learned Jesuits cannot tell her the meaning of God
from it, what are they good for?</p>
                  <p>7. One word or two I will speak concerning the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of ♄ and ♃, which happeneth in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1653; for then,
and not quite till then, will the effects of the ☌ of ♄ and ♃,
which we wrote of before, appear in their colours, that all
the world may see what they are: For as <hi>Herostratus</hi> set the
Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> on fire, that so he might get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a name, that he might be talked of after he was dead, so
the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> when no other good can be done, will set all the
<hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> that are <hi>priest-ridden,</hi> together by the ears,
that so they may get themselves a name, though of infamy.</p>

I had thought to have written concerning an Eclipse
of the Moon 1653. on March 3. but for some reasons best
known to my selfe, I shall passe it by here, and speak of it in
my <hi>Ephemeris</hi> for that year.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What the effects of this Ecclipse are probably like to
produce to every particular nation in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. IT being taken for granted, that the effects begin to
operate July 1652. the reasons of which I gave you
before, and are in full force, power, and vigour through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the years 1653, and 1654. and decline in the year 1655,
you may by this know the time of the sufferings of <hi>Europe,</hi>
an <hi>Epidemicall desease</hi> called <hi>madnesse,</hi> possesses the brains of
the Princes thereof, the FIFTH MONARCHY of the world
is coming, and the effects of this Eclipse make way for him:
but he is no <hi>Scotch man,</hi> no nor <hi>English;</hi> 'tis he before whose
coming, <hi>The Heathen shall rage, and the people imagine a vain
thing; the kings of the earth shall set themselves together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, &amp;c.</hi> Read the second Psalm throughout, and
you shall see both what shall antecede his Coronation, and
what shall follow it. I cannot but admire at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sottishnesse of those that prate and scribble of
any other Monarchy to succeed amongst the sons of
men, when the Scripture speaks exactly, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44,
45. <hi>And in the dayes of these kings, shall the God of heaven
set up a kingdome, which shall never be destroyed: and the
kingdome shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
pieces and consume all these kingdomes, and it shall stand for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountaine without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
the brasse, the clay, the silver and the gold, &amp;c.</hi> this is the
stone which the builders refused, but God will make the

shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume, and
to destroy it unto the end, and the kingdom, and dominion, and the
greatnesse of the king dome under the whole heaven shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the people of the Saints of the Most High, whose king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is an everlasting kingdome, and all dominion shall serve
and obey him;</hi> This, this is the MOMARCHY that I expect,
if the Lord please to grant me life to see it; yet I expect it not
in the effects of this Eclipse, for this Eclipse shall onely
make way for it. I am of opinion <hi>Grebner</hi> in his Prophesie
of his <hi>Vtopian Monarch,</hi> having by <hi>art caballistick</hi> obtained
the two first letters of his name, mistook <hi>Charls</hi> for

the <hi>fifth Monarchy,</hi> and when you see all <hi>Europe</hi> together

In a word, when you see all <hi>Europe</hi> in an uproar,
then think of these things, and know that he that shal come,
will come, and will not tarry.</p>
               <p>2. The Germanes are as bad together by the ears as they
were in the dayes of that conquering King of <hi>Sweden. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi>
suffers extremely; the truth of it is, I doubt the poor
<hi>Emperour</hi> will be totally routed, and made no <hi>Emperour</hi> at
all.</p>
               <p>3. As for <hi>England,</hi> I cannot sing a <hi>quietus est</hi> to them as yet,
within a few years I shall; Thou hast but one storm to endure,
bear that with patience, I hope thy wars are almost at an end,
I would thou couldst keep thy own brains from fanaticall
furies, and <hi>learn to know what belongs to thy peace before it be
hid from thine eyes.</hi> Thou wilt in the year 1653 be mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with a consuming pestilence, and troubles, with a change
of Government at one and the same time, make thy choice
wisely, God will have his owne Government established in
thee, whether thou wilt or no; and tell me one thing, and
tell mee truly, whether is it fit he should have his will, or
thee thine? should he be master, or thee? In making thy
choice of thy next Representative, take counsell of God, <hi>see
what he speaketh to thee</hi> (or as it should be translated, <hi>in</hi> thee;)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54723:39"/>
                  <hi>so will he speak peace to thy soul, that thou mayest not return</hi>
AGAIN <hi>to folly:</hi> For assure thy selfe of this, thou shalt find
my words true, as when the Sun is upon the Meridian, thou
shalt never be free from plagues, either of war, (or as I rather
think) pestilence, or famine, till thou doest submit to such a
Government as God intends for thee; the cryes of the poor,
whom thou doest tyrannically defraud of their bitthrights,
are heard in the ears of the Lord God Almighty. Be pleased
to read every morning the. 26 chapter of <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The Jesuites set all <hi>Europe</hi> together by the ears, let <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi>
in <hi>Italy</hi> beware of August 1653, lest either the sword,
earthquake or pestilence, destroy it. Ah poor University!
I mourn for thee, so much goodhast thou done to the world
in generall. <hi>Lombardy</hi> is quite and clean destroyed, and
beasts possesse the seates of dead people: The <hi>Pope</hi> hath got
the impudence to outface heaven, to see if his Bulls can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
the thunder.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>Turks</hi> fall into a part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which maketh his
<hi>Holinesse</hi> tremble, but he knoweth how to leave Saint <hi>Peters
keys,</hi> and take Saint <hi>Pauls sword</hi> in hand; the truth is, his
fear is more then his harm, its not the <hi>Turk</hi> shall pull down
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and yet he must fall.</p>
               <p>6. The effects of this Eclipse shall shew themselves first of
all in their colours in <hi>France.</hi> Strange massacres, desperate
tumults, fire and sword, and whatsoever else is bad, molest
that kingdome: and it's his own fault, he carryeth himselfe
as like a <hi>tyrant</hi> over his subjects as a Pome-water is like an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if about the later end of this year 1652, that poor King
is not either knock'd on the head, or forc'd to leave his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
say I am so ignorant, that I know not a Star from a
Hop-pole; let him beware of his Bishops and Jesuites, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> for fear they have learned
a Scotch trick, to sell him to his adversaries for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>7. Let not that Noble and Valiant soul the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
aspire to the kingdome: God hath a determination to
blast aspiring braines. If ever that Valiant and Wise Prince
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54723:39"/>
come to raign, it shall be, <hi>aut nequicquam, aut nequaquam,</hi>
either not at all, or in vaine; ours was the first Monarchy
that was brought to an end, and <hi>France</hi> shall be the next;
the heavens have decreed it, and its vain for man to kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the pricks. Two years shall not passe over thy head,
<hi>O France,</hi> but <hi>thy Monarchy shall come to its fatall and finall,
catastrophe,</hi> and leave thy ruined nation in such a pickle,
that thy pleasant and fruitfull land shall be reduced to such
a barrennesse, for the wickednesse of those that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that this present age shall not live to see it recru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>8. Thou Famous <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> (and famous mightest
thou have continued, hadst thou not harboured so many
Rogues and Whores) look to thy selfe, I fear before the
year 1653 be elapfed, the <hi>Turk</hi> will have possession of
thee; it would grieve a mans heart to see the streets runne
down with blood; I wish I may be found a false Prophet in
this, yet whether I be or not, it would do thee no harm to
make thy peace with God.</p>
               <p>9. Its almost a wonder I have forgot the Hollander all this
while, who shall neither be the last nor the least sufferer in
this Eclipse, a body would have thought that nation had been
wise, had they not committed themselves to the protection
of the King of <hi>France;</hi> but when <hi>France</hi> shall be together
by the ears, and more blood spilt there then wine prest, then
may the poor <hi>Dutch</hi> man say, as the <hi>Emperour</hi> once did,
when he trusted to the <hi>Pope</hi> for some great courtesie, which
he thought would make him and his heirs for ever, the <hi>Pope</hi>
playes the man, and dieth (not because he was weary of
this wicked world, and made haste to be in another, for hee
alwayes loved this world with all his heart, else he had never
built a tabernacle in it) the <hi>Emperour</hi> hearing of the Popes
death, now saith he, My cake is dough, I never thought of
the Popes dying before: And just in such a pickle will
<hi>Holland</hi> be, when her protecting king is fled for his life:
her necessities will be very great, none will succour, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pity her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54723:40"/>
Tenthly, The Monasteries of <hi>Germany</hi> are like to be
made no Monasteries during the effects of this Eclipse. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by that time the yeer 1654 be elapsed, Popery will
breathe its last in <hi>Germany.</hi> God in heaven grant they set
up the truth in its stead; that, like other Nations, they do
not (with <hi>Esop's</hi> fish) leap out of the frying pan, into the fire.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, During the effects of this Eclipse in <hi>England,</hi>
but how soon it will be I know not, either at, or before the
beginning of the yeer 1655, (the wiser my brethren of the
Communalty carry themselves, for ought I know or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
the sooner it may be effected) the Government will
come into the hands of the People, and everlasting peace
shall we enjoy, and never more Warr shall afflict us. And
(if we may trust to a piece of <hi>Art Caballistick</hi>) in August
1655, <hi>Rome</hi> falleth, and <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> the
Prince of Peace may reign amongst us. I'll say no more
to them now. I may have occasion to speak to them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, <hi>London,</hi> beware of a Pestilence 1653; get
able Physicians: And though many men tell thee of thy
finall <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> and fright thee with <hi>Mother Skiptons</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
which, if it come to passe upon thee at all, it will
be in the yeer, One thousand six hundred sixty eight. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
thou to be one of the Elect of God, and hold up but
thy head till the later end of the yeer One thousand six
hundred fifty five, and I am confident, both thy danger and
destruction is past.</p>
               <p>I could tell the sad things shall afflict thee in the yeer
One thousand six hundred fifty three. But when <hi>Phaeton</hi>
foretold of a great fire that should burn up the greatest
part of <hi>Italy,</hi> they got the honest soul, and accused him
for setting the world on fire, and drowned him in the River
<hi>Po.</hi> And haply, should I tel <hi>London</hi> the truth, I might be
inhumanely dealt withall my self; for this is an age in which
<q>
                     <l>Obsequium amicus, veritas odium parit.</l>
                     <l>'Tis flattery that gets men friends:</l>
                     <l>Tell but the truth, all friendship ends.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54723:40"/>
I give <hi>London</hi> leave to make the moral of it; however she
dealeth with me, I shall not forsake her in her extremities.</p>
               <p>13. The rest of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> must fall as sure as a
club: and next to <hi>France, Poland</hi> is like to go to pot, if it be
not contemporary with it: <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> happily next;
(it is sufficient for us to prognosticate exactly their downfal, though
we cannot exactly finde out the time:) and happily <hi>Sweden</hi> may
come to ruine before <hi>Denmark,</hi> especially if the <hi>Queen</hi> light of
such a <hi>HVSBAND</hi> as probably she may; let the Child of that
valiant Father beware of an unfortunate Match about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 1653: if not, the ruine of that Kingdom may happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the beginning of 1654. In the mean season, let <hi>Sweden</hi> be
ruled by me, to have a care of their Witches, of which, I am
very jealous, it contains many thousands, who though they cannot
probably bring a destruction upon that <hi>Monarchy</hi> by their witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts,
yet they may the more provoke the vengeance of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, who hath said, <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. The <hi>Florentines</hi> are as full of Tumults as a Wood is full of
Trees: The <hi>Cossaks</hi> fall into <hi>Christendom</hi> with fire and sword,
and I doubt upon the Territories of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> is quite and clean routed out of the
<hi>West-Indies,</hi> or else I am mistaken; as he hath formerly there
made Slaves of other people, (nay, he would have served the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boons</hi>
so too, could they but have spoken,) so in 1654, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the place shall be rid of this, and finde another Master, and
yet scarce a better. I remember a notable story in the <hi>Egyptian
Chronicle,</hi> when the <hi>Turkish Emperor</hi> besieged <hi>Grand-Cairo,</hi>
the Inhabitants of that great and populous City refused to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
assistance to the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> against the <hi>Turk;</hi> it is confessed
the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> stood to their tackling like Soldiers, and lost the
City by inches, and the Inhabitants got a worse <hi>Master,</hi> the
<hi>Turks</hi> being more imperious over them then ever the <hi>Mama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes</hi>
were. I am afear'd of the like change to the Inhabitants of
the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and especially <hi>Guiana.</hi> But who it shall be, I
leave for time to determine.</p>
               <p>16. <hi>The Nations of</hi> Europe <hi>flutter to save their Kings, which
never did them good, nor never will; even like a Bird brought up
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54723:41"/>
in a Cage, that regardeth not liberty, because it never knew what
it was. I remember a pretty story in</hi> AEsops Fables, <hi>which I
care not greatly if I recite;</hi> The Frogs desired a King of Iupiter,
neither would they be pleased unless they had one: <hi>Jupiter</hi> (to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them) threw down a great beam into the water, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it had astonish'd them awhile, they began to grow bold with
it, and leapt upon it, yea and despised it too, because it was pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
They fall a croaking to <hi>Jupiter</hi> again, and they must have
a stout King that could fight, I marry must they: <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their importunity, sends them the Stork, who stalking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Pool, as the Frogs came to do obeysance to him, he eat
them up. <hi>I leave every rational man to make the Moral of it, it
is plain enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. An Earthquake is like much to annoy <hi>Italy,</hi> the Peoples
<hi>Madness</hi> and the Jesuites <hi>Knavery</hi> much more. <hi>Italy! Italy!</hi>
that ancient Nation where the Poets say <hi>Saturn</hi> once ruled when
he turned <hi>Leveller</hi> and brought up the <hi>Golden-Age,</hi> I am sorry
for thy sufferings, but cannot help them; I would thou wouldst
do thy self so much good, as learn a little more Wit.</p>
               <p>18. A Fire threatens <hi>Constantinople,</hi> so doth Dissention, and
something worse then either; the great <hi>Turk</hi> is either slain, or
runs away for his life, if a bow-string stops not his journey:
you would laugh to see the <hi>Tartarian</hi> invade <hi>Turkey</hi> much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 1654: I will promise him if he do about that time,
he will go neer to carry it. I would to God he would learn to
be so wise as the noble <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who is never to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without an Epethite of Honor.</p>
               <p>19. In the year 1654, <hi>England</hi> begins to grow quiet, and I
am glad of that: she enjoys her desired Liberty, which she hath
spent so much blood for: the time is coming, it is but two
years to it, or but a little more, not quite three: and presently
after <hi>Holland</hi> begins to be pretty secure, after once she hath
learned to <hi>look to the Rock from whence she was howen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I had best leave off, whil'st matters go well.</p>

               <p>IF I may make bold to write a short Apologie in stead of a
Conclusion, I desire you to take notice, that in the years 1641,
and 1642, the notions included in this book took up a great part
of my study, for indeed in those years I was totally studious;
but finding some weakness in them, and the times changing as
swift as the winde, and swifter too, being not in the posture
at that time to receive such influences as now they are, I took
the pain lately a little to amend them; I confess the greatest
part of my judgments I drew purely from <hi>Astrologie,</hi> yet will
I not deny, but I made use of a <hi>Caball</hi> for the perfecting most
of them.</p>
               <p>If any affirm it was boldly done of me to adventure upon
such a manner of judgment in this Age; I answer, Boldness
may be taken in a <hi>paradoxical</hi> sence, not so much according to
the <hi>deed done,</hi> as according to that conception of the Caviller:
For King <hi>Iames</hi> held he was a bold man that first adventured to
eat a raw Oyster, though we now know there is no boldness in
it. A few years will shew whether what I have written be true
or false; and he that carps at me before he knows that, shews
rather his own folly, then my <hi>weakness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Imagine what I write be every word false, what <hi>harm</hi> will
it do <hi>Princes</hi> to prepare for the loss of a kingdom, though it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come? Is it not the way to teach them <hi>humility?</hi> I am
sure they are proud enough. Were it not acceptable both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> that they would leave off their <hi>TYRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY?</hi>
Imagine such sicknesses never come to the <hi>Vulgar</hi> as I
say this Eclipse threatens; will it do <hi>them</hi> any <hi>harm</hi> to make
their peace with <hi>God,</hi> though they do not die? But most people
send <hi>preparation for death</hi> before hand, and intend to <hi>overtake</hi>
it on their <hi>death-beds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am not conscious to my self of any grand failings in these
predictions, and</hi> I <hi>am the more confident of the truth of them,
because they jump so exactly with the</hi> Prophesies <hi>in</hi> Scripture.
I <hi>know it is the opinion of many in Art, that the coming of</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54723:42"/>
Christ <hi>to reign (whether in</hi> Person, <hi>or in</hi> Spirit, I <hi>will not
dispute the story here) cannot be yet these many years, neither
probably should it be by rules of Art drawn from</hi> judicial A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologie:
<hi>neither am</hi> I <hi>ignorant that the</hi> Cabal <hi>holds it out to
come sooner: happily</hi> the days may be shortened for the Elects
sake; <hi>yet can I give you divers Characters, or if you will exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
signes, even from the Scripture it self, of its approaching,
Matth. 24 6, 7.</hi> You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall rise against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom,
and there shall be famine and pestilence, and earthquakes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places. <hi>ver. 10.</hi> They shall betray one another, and hate one
another. <hi>ver. 11.</hi> Many false Prophets shall arise, and shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
many. <hi>ver. 12.</hi> Iniquity shall abound, and the love of many
shall wax cold. <hi>ver. 24.</hi> There shall arise false Christs, and false
Prophets. <hi>ver. 32.</hi> Learn a Parable of the Figg-tree, when his
branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, you know the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is nigh, even at the door. <hi>I shall quote but one Scripture
more. 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> This know also, that in the last
days perillous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their
own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to
parents, unthankful, unholy; without natural affection, truce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers,
false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that
are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more
then lovers of God, HAVING A FORM OF GOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINES,
BVT DENYING IT IN THE PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WER
THEREOF. <hi>If these be not testimonies enough
the truth of my Predictions approaching, I shall remit my
self to the judgment of such as are more judicious; and for a
conclusion, I will make no other then what</hi> Solomon <hi>did in his
recantation,</hi> Eccl. <hi>12. 13, 14.</hi> Let us hear the conclusion of the
whole matter, fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is
the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be
evil. <hi>And to such as do fear God and keep his Commandments,
I shall remain a friend till death,</hi>
