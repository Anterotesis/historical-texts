            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>You are in the right, and so it is done, if he had ordered you to receive Stuffs, Sugars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to sell out again, or deliver any part of them to any body, to see what remains. But what say you to the next Rule you call <hi>Multiplication?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>This Rule I imagin saves much time in putting down several Sums, and then adding of them up; for by <hi>Multiplication</hi> I can see immediately what they come all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to without <hi>Addition,</hi> if it be but a single Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication; for if my Father give me 3 <hi>d.</hi> for 9 days together, I need not set down 9 times 3 <hi>d.</hi> but set down 9, and multiply by 3, for 3 times 9 is 27 <hi>d.</hi> And by this Rule of <hi>Multiplication</hi> I can tell you many things; As suppose I am sent to School 9 miles from home, and I have been at School 224 times, then I have gone 2016 miles; whereas if I should set down 9 224 times, it would be very tedious and troublesom.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>That answers me many Questions; For if I would know how many shillings there is in 100 <hi>d.</hi> I need only divide 100 by 12, and there comes out 8 <hi>s.</hi> and 4 <hi>d</hi> in the Quotient, and is exceeding useful in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99634:11"/>
the working of many Questions; as if there be 21469 Inches, if I divide it by 12, then I know that there are 1789 Foot and 1 Inch; and if I would know how many Yards there are, I do but divide it by 3, and there are 596 Yards and 2 Foot.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This is very true, as I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to you in many things hereafter: And indeed all manner of Questions are answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wrought by <hi>Addition, Substraction, Multiplication,</hi> and <hi>Division,</hi> let them be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so hard and difficult.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I have often heard of many short Rules that are used by Merchants, which cut off that tedious way of the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> but never could do any of them, nor have I ever seen them done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>If you resolve upon learning the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of a Merchant, and that you will seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bend your Mind unto it, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to instruct you in any thing, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thereunto.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I return you my hearty thanks for it, and do assure you, I shall not only be very careful in observing your directions, but also very thankful for the same; and hope you will pardon my troubling you with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mean and insignificant Questions, which through my ignorance I shall be forced to ask you.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I shall be very willing to hearken to

all your Questions, and to answer them to the best of my skill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I pray Sir let me know then the Work I shall be put upon, when I come to be an Apprentice, from the lowest unto the highest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The first Work you will be put unto, and which indeed is the lowest you can be put unto, is the fetching Letters from the Posthouse, and carrying Letters to the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house; in the discharge of which there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not much skill, but a great deal of Care, Honesty, and Diligence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I cannot conceive what great matter this may be to me, for a Porter may carry a Letter, or a Maid, or Foot-Boy; Wherein can my Care, Honesty, or Diligence be discern'd in this Matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>In several respects a Master may be damaged very considerably: If the Servant be not careful and honest, his Letters may be lost, or may miscarry, or may come too late for him to answer his Ends.</p>

               <p>I desire you then, Sir, to shew me how I shall avoid doing my Master harm in this particular, and how I may discharge my self as I should, and I will endeavour so to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must be sure, when you are sent to carry Letters to the Posthouse, to tell the Letters as you receive them from your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and tell them in again to the Post-Office;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99634:12"/>
for if you receive twenty Letters, and lose one of them by the way, that very Letter may undoe your Master; and it is as much loss to him if his Letter be thus mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, as if you should go on purpose and fling it in the River; therefore be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when you receive your Letters, where you put them, and how you carry them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to the Post-Office your self when you come there; trust not to others to give in your Letters, but give them in your self, and see that the Post-Man take them; have a care that you do not keep back (as too many unjust Rascals do) the Mony for those Letters that are to pay; and because you can put it off with a Lye, and think no Body saw you, you will never be found out: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake it not, for in eight days, or fifteen days at most, comes news from your Master's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent, That that Letter did never come to his hands, and then is your Roguery found out; and instead of being advanced you are undone, for no Master will keep such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; he that is not faithful in little, shall not be made master of much. When you receive your Letters from the Posthouse, stand not gaping in the Street, or playing with idle Boys, thinking because you have gotten the Letters it is well enough; for a quarter of an hours News before-hand is worth much, and may get or lose your Master many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99634:13"/>
of pounds, by the advice he may receive in the same Letter, of the Rising or Falling of a Commodity beyond the Seas; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be very careful in this first Work, for it depends only on Care and Honesty, and will draw your Master's Love to you. I have stop'd longer upon this Point than I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because many a careful laborious Master is undone by the negligence of a young care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Boy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Now I see the Evils I must avoid, and the things I must do, I hope I shall follow the Good, and avoid the Bad. But what will be the next Work I shall be put upon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The next Work you will be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (if you are careful and ingenious) will be, to Copy Letters; and here if you give your mind unto it, you will learn much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; for by the diligent Copying the Letters, you will (if your Master write a good Hand) mend your Writing, you will be able to understand the Method of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to write good Sense, and to judg of most things belonging to a Merchant: This you must rather esteem an advantage unto you, than a burthen, as some foolish young Men do, and think it long er'e the Letter be Copied, and their Work over.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But pray Sir, let me know what you mean by Copying of Letters, for I know not what it means, having never yet seen any thing like it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99634:13"/>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Copying of Letters is this; When your Master hath written a Letter, then he gives it you, and you take a Book (he hath only for that purpose) and copy the same words exactly, word for word, as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath written it, except that at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Letter, usually put to all Letters, <hi>Your humble Servant,</hi> T. B. This you leave out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I am now satisfied in this particular of Copying of Letters, and shall not think my time ill spent if I do copy many, but shall endeavour to learn what I can out of them of the Custom of Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what is the next Work I may expect?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The next Work you may expect is, To be sent to the Water-side to take the weight of any Goods that are bought or sold by your Master; and herein you must be very careful, for here many Cheats and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences may be put upon you by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Persons, as Carmen, Porters, Watermen, Weighers, or other Merchants Men, older than yourself, and longer vers'd in the way of Trade.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir let me know how I can have any Cheat put upon me, or how I may be wronged, and I will endeavour to avoid it, for I would very willingly acquit my self as I ought?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The Work you will be put upon at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99634:14"/>
the Water-side, will be weighing of Goods your Master hath bought: And here you must have an especial eye to him that is the Weigher, for nothing is more common than for him to receive a Bribe, and slip out ½ a C. weight, or ¼ C. to your prejudice more or less.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I know not what you mean by a Weigher.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>I will explain it unto you. Suppose you are weighing a parcel of Sugars, there are a Crew (they call them) of Tackle-Porters, they come and bring Scales and Weights; and these Porters carry your Goods from the Warehouse to the Scale, and there one of them is the Man that manages the Weights; and when the Scales are even and ready to be unloaded, comes another of the same Crew, and they two tell out the ½ C. Weights, in which telling they are very apt to mistake; that which you have to do in that respect is, to have an especial eye to the Scale, and not to mind other rambling Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for a Master is much wronged by his Servants negligence herein.</p>
               <p>Another thing you must learn to graple with, is unruly Carmen: And that you may pretty well do, if you keep in your Pocket, from time to time, an abstract of the Laws for their Regulation, and the same for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen upon their unreasonable demands,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99634:14"/>
take but their Names, or Number of the Carmens Carr, and you will find a present alteration in them; nay, if you proceed, you will find good Justice immediately done you, without any charge: Therefore to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheated by them, be not run down with their damming and swearing Language, nor do you ever make your self familiar with them; for if you do make your self familiar they will presently crow over you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore always keep such Fellows at a distance from you, and sit not as some do (too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to their Masters prejudice) drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>This I will observe: But wherein will my Work consist, and what have I to do at the Water-side if my Master do buy or sell any Goods by weight?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Your Work is to have a small Pocket-Book in your Pocket; and when the Scales are all fixed, then to begin, order the Porters to put the first Draught into the Scale; and then when it is in the Scale, do you look out the Mark and Number of it, and set it down upon your small Paper-Book, or a clean sheet of Paper for that purpose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I know not what you mean by Mark and Number, I pray Sir explain that unto me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must know every Merchant hath his particular Mark belonging to him, by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99634:15"/>
which his Goods a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re known from another Mans, sometimes the Letters of his Name, sometimes a <hi>Star,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <figure/>
                  </note> a <hi>Grape,</hi> a <hi>Hand,</hi> and many things; and herein are most judicious Merchants cautious not of marking with any other Man's Marks but their own, for many Inconveniencies may arise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lex Mercat. pag. The Property of the Goods and Merchandize is judged to him by whose Mark they are marked or sealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every Merchant is to set down his Mark upon his Books of Accompt;</hi> and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances several Men that have lost their Goods by marking them with other Mens Marks. Indeed the best way for every Man is, To keep his own Mark; and therefore be very cautious how you do meddle with any other, but learn well how to mark, for it is a great grace to see a Man make a good Mark, as well as to write well; and that you may do it, you must learn to make the 24 Letters very plain.</p>

               <p>For the Marks that most Men use, are the two Letters of their Names; or in Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in this nature;
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>And for Numbers, they are generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the first Parcel of Goods that are sent; The first Hogshead is marked Number 1. the second N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. the third N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so continue according to the quantities that are sent, and by these Numbers any Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or Cask are known and distinguished one from another.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I desire you would now proceed to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99634:16"/>
let me know what I must do when I have set down the Mark and Number?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>When you have set down the Mark the Hogshead is, and the Number it is, then mind your Weight in the Scale, and count it your self (for fear of the Inconveniencies before mentioned) before you consent to the booking it down. When you have set the Weight down, then look upon the said Cask again, and see what <hi>Tare</hi> is marked upon it (if any) and set down that even with the Weight.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I know not what you mean by the <hi>Tare,</hi> pray let me know the meaning of that word.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tare</hi> signifies the weight of the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Cask or Pack the Goods are made up in, what it weighed before they were packed: for it is not just that he that buys your Goods should pay the same price for Wood, Leather, Canvas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or whatever your Goods are packed in, as for your Goods, therefore there is an allowance upon all Goods for the <hi>Tare,</hi> for it is impossible to take all Goods out of the Casks to see what the Weight is; and therefore according to the Goods, there are several Customs and Usages amongst Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Traders, as <hi>viz.</hi> some take the <hi>Tare</hi> as it is marked upon the several Casks, and that is called <hi>Invoice Tare,</hi> or <hi>Tare</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Factory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99634:16"/>
Others have that <hi>Tare,</hi> and 2, 3, to 10 <abbr>lb</abbr> upon a Draught or Chest, for <hi>Break</hi> they call it, over and above <hi>Invoice Tare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others take so much constantly <hi>per</hi> Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, so much <hi>per</hi> Butt, so much <hi>per</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this constantly round the Year when once they know the honesty of the packing; but generally all Tobaccoes are constant at so much <hi>per</hi> Hogshead, according to the wight, if 5 C. so much, if 7 C. so much, if 8 C. so much; but this is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the meaning of <hi>Tare.</hi>

               <p>Having thus set down your Weights then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99634:17"/>
before you go away from the Scale, be sure to call over your Weights with him that weighs them with you, for there are always two Persons to take the Weights, one for the Buyer, and one for the Seller; compare your Draughts, and if any difficulty arise, be sure to end it before you part, by weighing the same over again, for some may be so ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, as to put ½ C. or 1 C. more upon a Draught than it weighs, because they think a young raw Lad will not be so patient, or trouble himself to rumage 20 or 30 Casks to weigh that over again, and so a Man is cheated by the negligence of his Servant. When you have thus weighed your Goods, then you may compare them, and so is your Work of that nature ended.</p>
               <p>If you have Goods to measure, the like care is to be had; but for many Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the City hath taken a sufficient care for their Weights and Measures, (mistakes, which are subject to all Men, only excepted) as for Corn of all sorts, Coals, Hops; <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>Thus you see how the Goods are specified in a Bill of Parcels. If they be whole Bags, or Packs, you are to set down the Marks of them. And when these Goods come in to your hands, you must examine the Contents of the Bill against the Goods, and by that means see what you are charged withal, and be very exact to see wherein any difference may be, and note it down; for your Master will be wronged if you receive any thing less than the Bill of Parcels mentions: or if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99634:19"/>
the Bill mentions one sort of Goods, and the Goods prove to be another, you wrong your Master in taking them in.</p>

               <p>But what shall I do, Sir, if my Master comes to sell any Goods, and bids me make a Bill of Parcels of the Goods: As suppose he hath sold 10 Hogsheads of Tobacco, at 7 <hi>d.</hi> ½ <hi>per</hi> pound, then how must I do to make a Bill of Parcels for the same Goods, there being 3 or 4 Hogsheads of one Mark, and 2 or 3 of another?</p>

               <p>Sir, you have already told the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Gross</hi> and <hi>Tare,</hi> but I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what you mean by <hi>Clough.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By <hi>Clough</hi> I understand a Custom that hath been used time out of mind by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99634:20"/>
and Traders, when they sell any Goods by weight, they allow for every Draught of the Scale, if it be but <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <abbr>lb</abbr>, but 1 <abbr>lb</abbr>; but if it be more than <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <abbr>lb</abbr>, then 2 <abbr>lb</abbr> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Draught of the Scale; and this is, because the Weight should hold out again when it is re-weighed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What have I then to do next, seeing I have put down the <hi>Gross</hi> Weight, the <hi>Tare,</hi> and the <hi>Clough?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Your next Work is, to bring all this <hi>Gross</hi> Weight into small Pounds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what difference is there in the Pounds, why one are called <hi>Gross</hi> and the other sort <hi>Small,</hi> are these Pounds smaller in the quantity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>For matter of the Pounds they are all one, and have 16 Ounces to each Pound. The <hi>Gross</hi> are called so, because they are set down in C. q. and <abbr>lb</abbr>. and these are called <hi>Great Hundreds,</hi> because there is 112 <abbr>lb</abbr> to the Hundred, 56 <abbr>lb</abbr> to the ½ Hundred, and 28 <abbr>lb</abbr> to the ¼ of a Hundred; whereas the other, the <hi>Small Pounds,</hi> which are called <hi>Subtile Pounds,</hi> are so, because the Hundred of them is only 100 <abbr>lb</abbr>, the ½ Hundred 50, and the ¼ 25 <abbr>lb</abbr>.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How shall I bring these <hi>Great Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds</hi> into such <hi>Subtile Pounds?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>With great ease, only by multiplying of it; and observe to do it thus.</p>

               <p>What must I do now, cast these pounds up at 7 <hi>d.</hi> ½ <hi>per</hi>

               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No, if you sell them to a Freeman of the City of <hi>London,</hi> you must allow him <hi>Trett.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trett</hi> is a thing I never heard of yet, pray Sir let me know what it means?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trett</hi> is a Gift that is given by the Seller, only to Freemen of <hi>London,</hi> of 4 <abbr>lb</abbr> in every 104 <abbr>lb</abbr>; not 104 <abbr>lb</abbr> for 100 <abbr>lb</abbr>, you may easily mistake so, but 4 <abbr>lb</abbr> for every 104 <abbr>lb</abbr>; and this must be deducted before you cast up your Goods, unless you make your Bargain not to give <hi>Trett.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir let me know how I shall cast
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99634:21"/>
up this <hi>Trett,</hi> for it seems very difficult to me: if it were 4 for 100 it were very easie, but I cannot so well comprehend this; how must I do it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You will find it very easie; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally that which seems to be hardest, is most easie to bring to pass: for if you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider it, you will find it very plain; and to make it appear so unto you, there are but two things to be done.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Set down the Pounds 7160 <abbr>lb</abbr>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Divide them by 26, and what remains is the <hi>Trett,</hi> which you must deduct; and then the Remainder is the clear Weight you must cast up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Example.</hi>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Now seeing you know what the <hi>Trett</hi> is, proceed to take it out as above.
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:99634:21"/>
Thus you see what you must cast up; these are the Pounds, 6884 ½, at 7 <hi>d.</hi> ½.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir how must I cast up this, must I do it by the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> and say, if 1 <abbr>lb</abbr> cost 7 <hi>d</hi> ½, what shall 6884 ½ cost?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No, you shall not need to do that, for that way is exceeding tedious, only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these Rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Set down your Pounds of Tobacco.</item>
                     <item>2. Set down your price of 7 <hi>d</hi> ½.</item>
                     <item>3. Set down a Line under it.</item>
                     <item>4. Multiply the Pounds by the Pence.</item>
                     <item>5. See what part of a Penny ½ <hi>d</hi> is.</item>
                     <item>6. Take that part out of the Pounds of Tobacco.</item>
                     <item>7. See what odd weight there is, take it out of 7 ½.</item>
                     <item>8. Add up all together.</item>
                     <item>9. Divide by 12.</item>
                     <item>10. Cut off your last Right-hand figure, and halve the rest, which is dividing by 20, but shorter.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99634:22"/>
Thus you see it is presently done, and is not the tenth part so long and difficult, as if it were done by the <hi>Rule of Three.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Now having done this, and made the Bill of Parcels, What must next be done?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must, if the Goods be heavy, send them home by a Porter, Carman, or Waterman; and having booked this Bill of Parcels, letter for letter as you made it, you must send it with the Goods; and you must, to that Wast-Book where you put the Bill of Parcels, set your Name, or the Mens Names that delivered them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Why must any Names be put to the Wast-Book?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Because if the Party that bought the Goods (as too often it falls out) doth deny the Goods, or any part of them, then you can upon Oath testifie the delivery of them, and the Contents of the Bill of Parcels.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But now the Bill of Parcels is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly finished, Pray Sir let me see how it will look, that I may observe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>For your satisfaction I will set it down exactly; and when you come to make any Bill of Parcels, then you may observe the Places and Method how every thing should stand.</p>

               <p>Well Sir, this I am fully satisfied in, and shall endeavour to be compleat in it: What is the next thing that may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of me in my beginning to serve my Master?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The next thing required of you may be, To ship off Goods, or to unlade Goods, if you are with a Merchant; and herein your Work may change and vary much, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Trade your Master may be of, and according as the Customs and Usages may change from time to time at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-House; but for your Instruction, I shall observe some general Rules you cannot well be without.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I shall be very glad to hear of them, for I have been already sent to the Custom-house, and I find much difficulty in it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the shipping off of Goods, therefore I desire you to let me know how I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my self in that respect, and with whom I am likely to have to do, for to morrow I shall have ten Bayls of Cloth to ship off for <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Your Cloth being ready packt, you are to go to the Custom-house and carry the true Contents of the Goods, and there you are to enter them according to the usual manner, for many times their Methods change; but going thither by 9 a Clock, and carrying the true Contents of your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99634:23"/>
Goods, and giving in the same to the Clerks appointed; there is such care taken of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that from Man to Man the Clerks dispatch you; and having found out the first, he directs you to the second, and then he to the third, and so forward until you have the Commissioners (or Farmers) Hands, and the Office Seal; and this with such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is not imaginable for any Man, for any reason what-ever, to be put besides his Turn, but every Man served in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as his Business comes to hand. And no Clerk will demand more than his just Dues; if he doth, there is good Justice against him immediately, by complaining to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners (or Farmers) for the time being.</p>
               <p>Having thus gotten a <hi>Cocket</hi> (which is a small piece of Parchment testifying the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Customs and all Duties for such and such Goods) you fetch your Goods from the Packers, and having put on your Mark and Numbers, then you set the same Mark and Numbers on the back of your <hi>Cocket,</hi> mentioning the true Contents of each Bayl; this you must give to the Searcher, with his Fee, what he demands; and pay the Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fage and Portrage of your Goods, and so ship them in Boat, Lighter, or Ship, as you are directed; and order him that carries them, to bring you (before you pay him) a Receipt from the Master, his Mate, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99634:24"/>
Purser, of the receiving the said Goods; in words to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Received the 10th of</hi> Deceb. 1678, <hi>on board the Good Ship</hi> William <hi>and</hi> John, 10 <hi>Bayles, marked and numbred as underneath.</hi>

               <p>When I have this Note, or Receipt, from on board the Ship, what must I do with it? This I suppose is only to justifie the Watermans delivering the Goods, What must I have to shew for my Goods beyond the Seas, in case the Master denies them?</p>

               <p>You must, as near you can, by your Letters and Factories, guess at what quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Goods you have, and then go down to the Custom-house and carry Mony; and when you have found out the first Clerk, he will, as before, send you from Man to Man until your Business be compleated; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paid your Mony in the Morning, if you go to the Ship in the Afternoon, you will find there a Warrant for the delivering your Goods unto you.</p>

               <p>Certain it is, That there is much dammage to be gotten by going to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-house, and many a Man is ruined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and there are several ways to ruin a Man, if he hath not an especial eye over his Actions there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Example.</hi>

judg of the Servants time here so well as at another place, for sometimes his Business may be dispatcht in half an hour, that at another time cannot be dispatcht in two hours; and here the Servant, although he tarries two or three hours cannot be blamed. But then the misery is, there is a parcel of poor Fellows that hang about the Custom-house, that for 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 1 <hi>s.</hi> will take your Note and Mony; and whilst the Servant sits in an Alehouse, will do his Work herein. Although the Master is not dammaged, (his Work being done) yet the Servant gets idle Haunts, and comes acquainted with idle Company, and is many times (by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance) drawn into such Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that is not to be imagined. Another Injury he is liable unto, is, That many times by such Fellows means Business is not quite gone through with, or they meet many times with disappointments, and then both Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Master too are injured. Again, the Servant having command of Monies, is tempted to be spending that which is not his own; and if so, then he is forc'd to make it up again by many unlawful ways; as entring Goods short, or entring one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity for another, and many little pilfering things that are not minded by them, because they pass many times undiscovered; and sometimes again are found out, and then it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99634:26"/>
is too late, or else they to patch up that (as the Tinker) make another Hole far greater, which is not yet perceivable, but in short time after makes the Remedy then used worse than the Disease. It hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for many years, that Merchants Men have gained the most of their Ill-habits, by the loss of their time in such kind of Company. Besides, there are several things in which they are much outwitted by reason of their ignorance, by Land-Waiters, Tydes-Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore you are to have an especial care of being tempted to enter Goods too short, or of landing Goods before the Customs be duly paid; for there are many crafty Blades will endeavour to perswade you, there is no danger in it; and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young will think so, until you are caught; which thing brings many a sober Lad into much trouble, and his Master to great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But now, Sir, having been in this manner taught what I am to do at the Water-side, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in shipping or unlading Goods, I desire you to return again to the <hi>Compting-house,</hi> and shew me what I shall be imployed in next.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The next thing your Master may find you fit for, may be for copying of Accompts, or Factories, into his Books, before the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals go away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Before I go any further, I desire you, Sir, to let me know what is requisite to the making up a Compleat <hi>Compting-house;</hi> for by that means I shall be the better able to remember my Work when I know what Tools I shall work withal. And therefore I desire to know the Nature, and all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, as well Books as Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a <hi>Compting-house.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>As to a <hi>Compting-house,</hi> almost so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Merchants, so many Minds, or Fashions: but although they differ in trivial Things, yet in the substantial Things they do not disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree much. In a well-govern'd <hi>Compting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi> there must be these following Things, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A good handsome large Room, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and pleasant, about ten or twelve foot square: there being nothing more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a Merchant that minds his business than room; for there's no pleasure in being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99634:27"/>
squeezed up to a narrow place where much business is to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There must be two convenient Tables, one for the Master, another for the Man, or Servant, either made shelving as Desks, or else flat, which you are best used to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There must be convenient places for your Letters you receive, and herein Men differ much: some are for folding up their Letters, and endorsing on the back-sides from whence they come, when received, and when answered, and then putting them up in square Boxes for that purpose, like Pigeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, before them: And others are for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so many Files, as they have Places they receive Letters from, and file them up as soon as they are answered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Which way will you advise me then to take of the two?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Truly of the two I think filing them up is the best; for there you turn to the Letter in a minute, and find out the Passage, without having the trouble of folding or unfolding Letters to look for what you have occasion, but have recourse to them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and so hang them up again: but whether they are folded or filed, they must be both ways taken down at the Years end, and put up in a large Box for that purpose; and then you may have recourse unto them when you please, to view any thing as you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99634:27"/>
have occasion; with the Date of the Year upon the Box.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The like may be done by your Bills of Exchange, or Recepts for Money; or any other odd Papers, too tedious here to set down.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How often must I file up or fold up these Letters?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>As often as your Time will permit you; At the going away of each Post is the best time, for then all your Letters are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and you have nothing else to do with them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next thing you are to have, is to be provided with useful Books for your <hi>Compting-house,</hi> such as are necessary for you, and they are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Copy-Book of Letters, to copy out all the Letters that are sent out, word for word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Book wherein you copy out each Factory, or Accompt, that comes to your hands from beyond the Seas, of Goods sent your Master.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Book to copy out all the Factories your Master sends out of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A Bill-Book, to see what Bills you have to pay, and what to receive; this is called a <hi>Month-Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A small Book wherein you note all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99634:28"/>
the Orders that are given you for the buying or selling of Goods.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Book wherein (if you have much Commission-Business) you put all the Goods you are to receive on board any Ships that comes for <hi>England,</hi> or any other place where you live, that you need not run to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Cash-Book.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A Book of petty Expences.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A Receipt-Book.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A Waste-Book.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A Journal.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A Ledger.</p>
               <p n="13">13. A Street-Book.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Me-thinks, Sir, here are many Books; and I have often heard say, The fewer Books the better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The fewer Books the better indeed: but one that will be a true and exact Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, must not have any of these abated to his <hi>Compting-house.</hi> 'Tis true, some Men are great Traders, and keep all their Business in 1 Book; and it is as true, that many an Oyster-Woman drives a continual Trade, and keeps no Books at all. If you will be a Merchant, you must act as a Merchant; and really I cannot see how any of them can well be abated.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What else must I have to make my <hi>Counting-house</hi> compleat, for I would fain be exact in that Matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must have Ruler, Pens, Ink, Paper, Seal, Penknife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and such odd Trifles not worth the naming.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Then Sir, if you please, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly proceed, and desire you to tell me what use I must make of these Books, how they are to be ruled, and to explain it so to me, as that I may not be to seek in any thing; or if my Master should not put things in a right Method, that I may be able to do it as it should be: for my Master hath much business, and not at leisure to do things with that exactness they repuire. Therefore I desire you, Sir, to let me know what use every Book is put unto, and to begin with the first, the Copy-Book.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>To begin with the <hi>Copy-Book.</hi> You are to have a large Book in <hi>Folio</hi> unruled, and herein you are to copy every word <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I told you <hi>page</hi> 9. that your Master writes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose, Sir, my Master never saw the exact way of a Merchant's wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Letters, must I follow his Rule? Pray, let me know how I may discern between Good and Bad, and whether my Master is in the right or wrong way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>To distinguish betwixt Good and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99634:29"/>
Bad; you must know that there are several things to be observed in writing a Letter, and in placing every thing in its proper place, and like a Merchant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You must mention his Name you write unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You must mention the place you write from.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You must mention the Date you write.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You must mention the Title you put on him you write unto.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You must mention when you writ last to him, or when you received the last Letter from him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You must answer every thing that your Friend desires to know; or you must give him a punctual account of every thing you desire to have of him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then must you conclude with your own Name.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And at the bottom his Title again.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The price of the Exchange.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>This, Sir, I do pretty well compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; but yet I should understand it far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if you would let me see an Example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, of a Letter written upon any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding account, wherein there is mention made of somewhat received, and somewhat sent forth, by which I may better judg then now in this description you have made me, and I will gladly follow it.</p>

But your own Reason must be the best guide you can have, for none can so well judg as your self. You must answer always fully, and yet as pithy and concise as may be; and be sure omit nothing material.

               <p>You must, 1. Take out your sum of Mony that the Goods amount unto, thus.

               <p>Yes; having made this true Factory, or <hi>Invoice,</hi> then to set it in the Factory-Book

word for word, except the Name at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, <hi>J. Johnson,</hi> that you need not put, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Book it self implies that.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Proceed and make the next Factory you have upon it; for here is not any account of Debtor and Creditor: This <hi>Factory-Book</hi> is paged, and not folio'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I know not what you mean by Pages and Folio's; pray explain that unto me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By <hi>Page,</hi> is the putting a set Number from one side to the other on every side, as Number 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to Folio a Book, is to put the Folio, Number 1, upon the left side, and the like upon the right side; so that a Book of 50 Leaves reaches but to Number 50: but when a Book of 50 Leaves is paged, it goes to Number 100.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>What must I understand by the next Book, that you call a Book wherein you put the Copies of all Goods that come to you, to sell for other Mens Accompts as well as for your own Accompt; and how must I use it?</p>

               <p>This Book may be made equal to the bigness of the <hi>Factory-Book,</hi> and it may be ruled in the same manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:99634:33"/>
But instead of being paged, it must be folio'd from Folio 1 to the end.</p>

               <p>You must open it, and on the left-hand side, you must begin and observe these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To set down the Place the Factory is from that you are going to Book.</p>

               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By bringing it into <hi>English</hi> Money, I mean, the working of it from the Coins of any place where the Factory comes from, into that of <hi>England</hi> where you live; but that I shall shew you when I come further to the teaching you how to Calculate Exchanges.</p>

               <p>Thus you see the Examples of two Accompts in this Book; the one is where Goods are for your Accompt, and the other is for your Friends Accompt: and here you may observe much variety and pleasure, for you can immediately see by this Book what is wanting in any Parcel of Goods that is to be sold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir explain to me a little more at large the meaning of these two Accompts; I do understand some things of them, and something I do not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>What is it you do understand of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I understand most of the left side, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Title.</p>

               <p n="5">5. The Charges upon them, and then the Additions of each side, and the Provision at 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more or less that is to be taken. The things I do not understand, are the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures before each Contents of Yards and Ells what they mean; and then the (—) Strokes against those Figures, and the thing you call Brokerage, with the Explication of all the right-hand side, for I know it not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>For the first thing which you say you do not understand, which are the Figures, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 124, just before 24 Ells ¼, that N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 124,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99634:37"/>
and the Figures following in the same place are the Numbers of each Piece.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>What do you mean by Numbers, and of what use are they, and what is their Intent?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Every Man that makes Goods hath his Number to begin: As suppose a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briquer of Silks, Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do begin to make Silks or Stuffs, he doth put upon the first Piece N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1. and the length; the next Piece N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2. and the length; and so to the last Piece that he makes of any Goods. I have known some Fabriquants at <hi>Lions</hi> make Goods until they come to the Number of 35000 and odd. The use of the said Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are, When any Man hath occasion to find out any defect in the making any Piece, or any manner of want in any Piece of the true Measure; then you have reference to the Number, and that gives you light into it; or it shews you the Weaver that made it, or the Man that Callendred it: Or if a Piece be lost, or stolen, it tells you which it is; and many other things very necessary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What did you mean then by that which you call'd Marks and Numbers in the Margent?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The Marks and Numbers in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent are only in reference to the particular Pack or Barrel, and not to the several Pieces, or smaller Boxes or Parcels that are contain'd in it.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Well; What mean you by the (—) Stroke that is before each Piece, or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This: it is a sign to me, when I open my Books, that there are some of my Goods sold, and some are unsold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be the Number 124: 24: ¼, and it be unsold, it remains as it is; but if it be sold, then is the Number 124: 24: ¼, thus set down, — 124: 24: ¼. Some do thus 124: 24: ¼—which way of these you please; but they that are so marked, are those that are sold, and the other not sold; so that you satisfie your curiosity in a moment, and see what is, and what is not sold.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Brokerage,</hi> I shall explain it unto you in its due and proper place. But for the Right side of either of these Accompts, there you set down the Month you sold the Goods, the Day you sold them, the Man you sold them to, and the Time that you sold them for, as you see in the first of the Accompts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 2. Sold to <hi>George Crab</hi> at 1/M.</p>
               <p>Then do you set down the Numbers and length of each Piece, with the Price you sold them for; and at the end of each Price, cast up the Sum of Money it comes unto, and put it in the Margent, as the Piece in the

second Accompt, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 130: 22: ½ at 9 <hi>s.—l.</hi> 10: 2: 6: And having so put down all the Right side, see what it comes unto, and take your Provision out at 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and add that as in the second Accompt to the Left side, and add up both sides, and add up the same sides; and what is wanting on either side, is Profit or Loss.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But how shall I know which is Profit, and which is Loss?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>When the Right-hand side, where the Sale of the Goods are, amounts to more than the Left-hand side; by so much as it is more, so much the Profit is, as in the first Account; the Profit is <hi>l.</hi> 30: 8: 10 <hi>d.</hi> but where the Left-hand side is more than the Right-hand side, there it is so much Loss. This is when it is for your own Accompt.</p>

               <p>But what must I do when the Goods are for another Mans Accompt? As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; The second Accompt, How must I do that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>In the second Accompt you see that the Right-hand side comes unto <hi>l.</hi> 76: 10: <hi>9d.</hi> so much the Goods were sold for; and the Left-hand side was but <hi>l.</hi> 12: 16: 10 <hi>d.</hi> So the Ballance is <hi>l.</hi> 63: 13: 11. which must be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Credit of your Friend, Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Pelelyer</hi> that sent you the Goods; and if there had proved loss, as that the Goods should not have yeelded their Charges, (as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99634:39"/>
sometimes it doth happen) then you must carry the Ballance to his Debit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you by that word <hi>Ballance,</hi> I do not understand it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By the word <hi>Ballance</hi> I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, That if the Credit side be <hi>l.</hi> 76: 10: <hi>9d,</hi> and the Debit side <hi>l.</hi> 12: 16: <hi>10d,</hi> then the Ballance is just so much Money as will make this <hi>l.</hi> 12: 16: <hi>10d. l.</hi> 76: 10: <hi>9d.</hi> because then both sides (like a just Ballance) are even <hi>l.</hi> 79: 10: <hi>9d.</hi> and this is the meaning of the word <hi>Ballance.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Now, Sir, pray let me know what you mean by those words <hi>(Errors and bad Debts excepted)</hi> that are thus in a Parenthesis?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>These words are always expressed when Goods are sold for another Mans Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, as this second Accompt is, where there is <hi>l.</hi> 63: 13: 11 <hi>d.</hi> carried to his Credit. But now if any Error should be made, and it appear afterwards that there is but <hi>l.</hi> 53: 13: 11 <hi>d.</hi> or any manner of mistake, it must be allowed on the one side or the other: Or suppose that this <hi>James Web</hi> Break, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is lost by him, must be carried to the Debit. of Mr. <hi>Pelelyer,</hi> for whose Accompt the Goods were sold; or what-ever loss happens of those Goods to any other Person unto whom you sell them; and this is the meaning of that expression, <hi>Errors, and bad Debts excepted.</hi> If any mistake in Accompt,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99634:39"/>
or any bad Debts, the Party must be made Debtor for it. And thus I have shewed you the use of the third Book, called a <hi>Copy-Book</hi> of Accompts of Goods you sell for any Man. Now some, according to their quantity of Business and Trade, will put both these Books into one; and that may be done with ease; the difficulty is only in the <hi>Paging</hi> some Leaves, and <hi>Folioing</hi> of others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir proceed to the next, which you call a <hi>Bill-Book,</hi> and tell me what that is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This Book is very useful for those that Trade much in Exchange: because here they can immediately go and cast an Eye upon it, and see what Bills they have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and what to pay each day of the Month, and never have the trouble of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Bills themselves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I desire you would please to give me an Instance of this, by shewing me the use of the said Book, as you have done of the former three Books.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>For the use of it, Provide your self a Book of midling Paper, ruled, <hi>Pounds, Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> and <hi>Pence.</hi>

The Explication or meaning of this Book is this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Book is ruled with a usual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and with <hi>Pounds, Shillings,</hi> and <hi>Pence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Your Book is <hi>Folio'd</hi> and not <hi>Paged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Your 12 <hi>Folio's</hi> are for the 12 Months of the Year, beginning the first <hi>Folio, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> to Receive, <hi>January</hi> to Pay; and so forward to <hi>December.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. You put down the Date that your Bill of Exchange falls due the last day of the Bill.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You put down as much of the Body of the Bill as you can in one Line; that is to say, from whence it was drawn, and who sent it you, and in the Margent the Sum of Money it comes unto.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For Goods (if you have sold any that you are to receive your Money for) set it down here, and by that means you will know all you are to receive each Month, and the like you are to pay each Month; and this will be a very great ease to you in your Business; because here, if you intend to be a Man of Reputation, you will see when you are to receive any Money particularly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Now, Sir, what is the next Book you treat of, which you call a Book to note all the Orders of Buying and Selling?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This Book is not now in use by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Merchants: but if you will weigh your
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99634:41"/>
own Reason, you will find it to be a Book exceeding useful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose you receive 4 or 5 Letters in a Post, (some Men receive 20, 30, or 40) and those Letters brings every one of them an Order for Goods, some more, some less, to be bought for them; Would you run to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of these Letters to see what it orders? No; have your Order all writ out as soon as your Letters are read; and when you have effected them, then draw a Line cross each Order, or mark what is effected, and what not, and so you will never burthen your Memory.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What kind of Book must this be, and how must it be ruled?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This Book must be according to the quantity of Business you are like to have, some more, and some less; and if any thing considerable, then a good midling sort of Paper in <hi>Quarto,</hi> or else a good large <hi>Octavo,</hi> but it must not be ruled.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, let me see one Example of it. Suppose this Day my Master's Letters are come to hand, and there is an Order for buying some Goods for a Man at <hi>Paris,</hi> How must I set it down here?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:99634:42"/>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>To make a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> set it thus.</p>
               <p>Paris <hi>24th</hi> April, 1677.</p>
               <p>Out of Anthony Peloone's <hi>Letters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AN Order for</hi> 124 <hi>dozen of Calve-Skins, from</hi> 40 <hi>to</hi> 48 <abbr>lb</abbr> per <hi>dozen; to be packt in</hi> 10 <hi>Packs, and shipt for</hi> Roan, <hi>consigned to</hi> T. L. G. <hi>marked with his Mark; not to exceed</hi> 14 <hi>d.</hi> per <abbr>lb</abbr>.</p>
               <p>200 <hi>pair of Hose, at</hi> 3 s. 2 d. per <hi>Pair, of</hi> Browns <hi>making of</hi> Wells.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:99634:42"/>
This is the nature of putting what you find ordered you in each Letter: and when it is done, Examine it against the Letter to see if it be right, and it will prove of much ease to your Mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you by the sixth Book, for setting down Goods you expect from Friends?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This Book is much of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the other; and for the right use of it, you are to examine your Letters as soon as they come in, and see what Goods are consign'd your Master, and take out the Sum of the Letter into the <hi>Memorandum Book,</hi> either from the Letter, or from the <hi>Bills of Lading,</hi> one of the two: But it is very ill trusting to a <hi>Bill of Lading,</hi> for Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do daily happen, and I have known much dammage by trusting to a <hi>Bill of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> Therefore as soon as your Masters Letters come in, you may take the Book and enter them in this following manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:99634:43"/>

Thus you see this Book is just in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the former; and if your Trade be not too big, you may make the one end to put orders for buying Goods in at, and the other end for the expectation of having Goods from beyond the Seas at: but it is not so like a Merchant as to have two Books.</p>

               <p>By a <hi>Cash-Book</hi> I mean a small Book that is ruled, <hi>Pounds, Shillings,</hi> and <hi>Pence,</hi> and is <hi>Folio'd,</hi> not <hi>Paged,</hi> because there is a Debtor and a Creditor both appear before you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>He that keeps the Money is Master of the <hi>Cash-Book,</hi> and he is to write all himself in the <hi>Cash-Book,</hi> on the one side, and on the other side; what is paid out, to be put on the right side; and what is received, put on the left.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>I have known this Case examined, and found the Master cast: Which may serve as a Rule for all Masters not to meddle with their Mens <hi>Cash-Books;</hi> that when a Master hath written as well as the Man, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath been acquitted, and the Cash could not be called his, because his Master had put down what he pleased; although in truth the Master had done nothing but set down two or three Sums which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and given the Man at his coming in. Therefore this may serve for caution unto Masters.</p>

Having thus put these several Sums of Money received and paid, it is much after the Nature of a <hi>Cash-Book;</hi> and you may, if you please, have such a Book, or not. Great Traders (as I said before) will not have their <hi>Cash-Book</hi> cluttered with so many small and frivolous Articles; and indeed it is not fit for a Cash-keeper, or a Man of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Business in the House, to have to do with such small, and such inconsiderable Trifles as these are.</p>

               <p>That may be as my Master pleaseth, I see it is in the same nature as a <hi>Cash-Book,</hi> and I shall observe your Rule. But what is your next Book, that you call a <hi>Receipt-Book?</hi>

               <p>This Book is of no trouble at all, but is exceeding useful, and much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is carelesly lost for want of it: For if you take Receipts for Money upon Papers, and then scatter them carelesly, you are subject to lose them; or when you want them, cannot find them without much trouble; therefore a <hi>Receipt-Book</hi> is convenient, and here an ordinary midling Book will serve a Man 20 years time.</p>

Method of it, and how it ought to be kept.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This Book ought to be bound long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways instead of broad-ways, as other Books are: for generally Receipts are short, and little Paper serves, and therefore it would be but waste to Rule it and Bind it broad-ways; but let it be long-ways, and ruled with a Margent, and <hi>Pounds, Shillings,</hi> and <hi>Pence;</hi> and instead of being <hi>Folio'd,</hi> let it be <hi>Paged;</hi> and so if you have occasion, you can note in which Page your Receipt stands, and find it out immediately.</p>

               <p>I like your Proposition: I would not have you take any thing up for Truth, until you have found it so by Experience, and say <hi>Blew is Blew,</hi> because your Teacher tells you it is <hi>Blew,</hi> but I would have you able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betwixt a <hi>Blew</hi> and a <hi>Green</hi> by your own Knowledg: and therefore I shall be very willing to tell you what any thing means that you desire.</p>

               <p>The things I desire to know are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it's possible that I cannot now remember them all, but I shall as far as my memory doth reach: And they be such as these.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Fraight:</hi> I have observed you have spoken several times of <hi>Fraight,</hi> and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Copy of the Bill of Lading, in <hi>Folio</hi> 31. pray let me know what it mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fraight</hi> is a certain sum of Mony that a Master of a Ship is to have for carrying of Goods from one place to another: it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99634:50"/>
agreed upon by the Merchant that ships the Goods, and the Master of the Ship; and in most Countries it is paid when the Goods are landed: but here in <hi>England</hi> (for all our Forreign Plantations) it is paid in <hi>London</hi> before the Goods go away, because there is no species of Monies in the said Plantations.</p>

               <p>What is that then that is called <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> in the Bill of Lading? Must he be paid two sums of Mony for each parcel of Goods he carries?</p>

               <p>No: <hi>Avarage</hi> is a Duty which Masters have allowed them upon special Occasions; as when a Master of a Ship is obliged to throw over-Board any Goods for the safety of the rest of the Ships Loading: or when, to save a Ship, a Master in exceeding bad Weather is forced to cut an Anchor or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or when there is extraordinary Charges of Pilotry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in going up a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

               <p>How much <hi>Avarage</hi> is due to a Master in such cases?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The general <hi>Avarage</hi> that a Master hath, is, 1 <hi>d,</hi> cr 2 <hi>d,</hi> in every shilling Fraight; but if any very great Dammage, or some extraordinary Storm happen, then he is to have proportionable to that Sum he hath suffered, equally divided upon all his Fraight; and this is called <hi>Avarage.</hi>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you when you speak of paying <hi>Custom</hi> for the Goods you send out, or bring in?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Custom</hi> is a Duty that is paid to the Prince or States under whose Government you live, and is paid unto them towards the great Charges they are at in the defence of their Kingdoms or Dominions, against their Enemies, and for protection of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Trade, and the maintenance of Ships, Garrisons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But how shall I know what I must pay for these Customs and Duties you speak of, is there any certain Rule to go by?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; Each Nation hath a Book of the Rates and Prices set down, that all Commodities shall pay out or in, into their several Kingdoms and Dominions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Is it easie to be found out by these Books of <hi>Rates?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, very easie; Suppose you have 50 Hogsheads of Capers, &amp; you would know what you must pay Custom Inwards for them: look in the Book of Rates under the Letter C, and you will find Capers; and there you will find what the Capers are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at; and for every pound of English Money that they are valued at, you must pay so many shillings, and so of any other Goods whatsoever. But though in other Countries the Books of Rates should differ,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99634:51"/>
yet this is the nature and true meaning of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Having seen what Custom is, Pray Sir let me now know what Men mean when they talk of Bartering of Goods.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bartering of Goods,</hi> is the selling of Goods; and instead of Mony at the time of payment, they take Goods at a certain price, and so Goods pay for Goods. Formerly, before the use of Monies was known, Goods were always given for Goods; as Corn for Cloth, Sugar for Linen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is called <hi>Barter:</hi> And although Mony is the thing that answers all our Occasions here in <hi>England, Holland, France,</hi> &amp;c. yet most of other Places, as the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> one Commodity is given for another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and they know not what Mony means.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Now, Sir, that we are about this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Monies, and bartering Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, pray let me know what that is which they call <hi>Exchange,</hi> and how it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, because I have heard much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of it, and that for a Bill of Exchange I can have any Commodity sent me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exchange</hi> indeed is an excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, and is very commodious for all sorts of Traders, and hinders much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Danger, Charge, and perplexity of Mind. But before I tell you what it is, I will tell
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99634:51"/>
you what that Rare Merchant, the Author of <hi>Lex Mercatoria</hi> says of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Exchange for Monies is of great antiquity; for since the first Silver Monies coined by the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>is almost</hi> 1900 <hi>years. And even as Monie was invented to be made of the best Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, to avoid the troublesome carriage of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities up and down, and from one Country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another; so (upon the like Considerations) when other Nations, imitating the</hi> Romans, <hi>did coin Monies, Exchange by Bills for Monies was devised, to avoid both the danger and the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Monies, and the troublesome carriage thereof. This Mony now being made by divers Nations of several Standards, and divers Stamps and Inscriptions, (as a Mark of Soveraignty) caused them to appoint a certain Exchange for the permutation of the several sorts of Coins in divers Countries, with ut any Transportation of the Coin, but giving</hi> Par Pro Pari, <hi>or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for Value, with a certain Allowance to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Merchant.</hi> This he certifies to be the cause of Exchange.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray Sir, let me know what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is, and how it is managed betwixt Man and Man, by some one Example.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>That you shall; Propound unto me your Question, and I will answer it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>My Question then is this: Sir, My Master hath bought some Goods for a Man formerly named, that is, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> P. of <hi>Roan,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:99634:52"/>
as by the <hi>Invoice</hi> sent him <hi>16th May</hi> appeared, and he ordered my Master to draw the same Mony upon him at double Usance in a Bill of Exchange: How must this be done, and what shall I know my Master is to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Man in French Mony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This is answered in this manner: You must go unto the Exchange, and there you must by a Broker enquire what Person hath occasion to have Mony paid at the same Place of <hi>Roan.</hi> Your Broker will bring you several Men: then your Work is to demand a price for your Bill, (and that price is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways set with a Consideration of the Specie or Coin the other Nation Exchanges in; Now <hi>France</hi> exchanges with <hi>England,</hi> and all other Nations in the World, with Crowns): Suppose you demand 56 <hi>d. per</hi> Crown for your Sum you are to draw: the Broker he offers you 55 <hi>d.</hi> ½; your work is to maintain your Reputation by endeavouring to get as high a price as may be for your Bill, (or else your Reputation lies much at the Stake); at last you are agreed, and then you desire to know who he will have the said Mony pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto; he tells you, to <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> or his Order, for the Value received of him. Then home you go, and to making this Bill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But how shall I make this Bill, Sir, and in what form?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:99634:52"/>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Before you make the Bill, you must see what quantity of French Crowns he must have, at 55 <hi>d.</hi> ¾ in <hi>France,</hi> for this <hi>l.</hi> 99: 4: <hi>6d.</hi> which he gives you here in Mony for your Bill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>This I doubt will be hard for me, for I do not yet conceive the manner of it, and therefore I am fearful I shall not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The thing is very easie, and soon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, if you do but observe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Merchants usually give two Bills of Exchange, and they are both of one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, except these words <hi>(my first not being paid)</hi> when you make the second Bill: Or these words, <hi>(my first and second not being paid)</hi> when you make your third Bill: But a Merchant is obliged in honour to give two, three, four, or more Bills of Exchange, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Mony be paid: and this is in case any of these Bills of Exchange be lost, that the Party that gave the Mony be possessed of a Bill of Exchange until he hath received his Monies again in Forreign Parts. And this is the cause why more Bills of Exchange than one are given.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How many Bills are usually given at the first making of them, and what is the usual way of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The usual method is this: When you draw your Bill of Exchange, if you do not know the Man well that takes it, you send him the first and second Bill together, and receive your Mony; but if you are satisfied in the Man, you send him only the first Bill, and the next day you send him the second Bill by a Servant, and receive the Mony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>When I carry this Bill the next day, may I part with it before I have my Mony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99634:55"/>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>That is according as you know the Man; and if he be a Man of any esteem, you may deliver your Bill before you have the Mony; for that would be very abusive, to keep your Bill of Exchange until you have the Mony; and if your Master have given him credit with the first Bill, you may well trust him with the second Bill until the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be paid you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But now, Sir, suppose my Master hath a Bill of Exchange sent him from beyond Sea upon any one in <hi>London,</hi> what must I do in that case?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The first thing you have to do, is, to get the said Bill accepted by him upon whom it is drawn; and bring it your Master a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose that the Man will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the said Bill of Exchange, what must I do then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then you must carry it unto a <hi>Publick Notary,</hi> and give it him to protest it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I know not what you mean by a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Notary</hi> and <hi>Protesting</hi> it; pray Sir let me know what the meaning of it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Publick Notary,</hi> is a Man appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King's Majesty, or the States of any Common-Wealth, to be Witness to any Act that is done and transacted betwixt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and Merchant, or Man and Man, in any matter of Trade: And these Men are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99634:56"/>
esteemed by others beyond the Seas more than ordinary Men, because they are set in places of Authority; and what they Act is esteemed Just and True, because they are put in places of Trust; though what another particular Man said is not much regarded, nay not at all in any manner of difference at Law; whereas the affirmation of the other is as good as any Witness whatever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir let me know what these Men are used generally for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>That I shall in this Example follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: You have received a Bill of <hi>l.</hi> 100 from a Friend in <hi>Holland,</hi> upon Mr. <hi>A B.</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and you are sent with this Bill of Exchange to Mr. <hi>A. B.</hi> to have him accept it; and he tells you that he will not accept it: you are to bring back this Bill to your Master, and he sends it back to <hi>Holland,</hi> and writes word that he had sent it to be accepted, and Mr. <hi>A. B.</hi> would not accept it, but said, He could not do it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Man that drew the Bill at <hi>Holland,</hi> tells you it is false, and he is sure Mr. <hi>A. B.</hi> will accept it, and that he never gave any such answer. This now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a quarrel betwixt you, and you cannot be reconciled. But when the said Bill is carried to a <hi>Notary,</hi> and that <hi>Notary</hi> doth signifie by Protest that that Bill was presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Mr. <hi>A. B.</hi> said he would not accept it: This Protest of the <hi>Notary,</hi> where there
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99634:56"/>
is nothing but his bare word, is believed as much as if 500 Men were there to swear it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>And are these Men used in nothing but for Bills of Exchange?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; Suppose your Master have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Commission from <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. for the selling of 20 pieces of Linens, and those Linens hold short, or are dammaged, or are not merchantable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate before a <hi>Notary,</hi> made by the Buyers of the Goods, or by Persons that are knowing in the said Commodities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Man that sent them unto your Master must rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Or, if he have bought them for your Masters Accompt, he may force, by virtue of that Certificate, satisfaction from them that sold them unto him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>In what other Cases are these Men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in Trade?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>In the making of Protests against Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Ships for demurrage, in the deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Fraight for Goods, in the making Charter-parties, in any thing wherein a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Witness is necessary; This Man supplies the place, and answers any dispute that is made. Or, if you have any Paper or Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is useful, and the loss of it would be prejudicial unto you, you may have a true Copy of it drawn by a <hi>Notary;</hi> and he assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99634:57"/>
the same, you may make the same use of it as of the Original it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Now you have opened unto me the mystery of a <hi>Notary,</hi> pray Sir let me know what I have next to do, in case this Bill be not accepted, or that it be accepted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>If the Bill be not accepted, you must send the same Bill with the Protest back unto the Man which sent it, and desire him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you other Monies, or to have a care of himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you shall judg best to write.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But still, Sir, you do not tell me what kind of thing this <hi>Protest</hi> is that you are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this while; I desire you to let me see the Copy of one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Well, that you shall: And suppose the Bill of Exchange were from <hi>Paris</hi> the 24 <hi>April,</hi> for 600 Crowns, at 54 <hi>d.</hi> upon <hi>J. M.</hi> drawn by <hi>J. Johnson,</hi> at double usance, and you have been to have it accepted, then thus doth the Protest run, if it be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?

               <p>Then look back to <hi>Folio</hi> 91, there you will see the Copy of a Bill of Exchange for 427 Cr. 9: 5. where you may observe,</p>

               <p>Now the <hi>Endorser</hi> is he unto whom <hi>J. W.</hi> doth make it payable unto afterward: for we will suppose <hi>J. W.</hi> is a Man in <hi>London</hi> that hath occasion to use this Mony to buy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99634:58"/>
Goods in <hi>France,</hi> and he knows not which of his Factors he shall make use of as yet, but keeps the Bill by him 12 or 15 days; at last he takes the Bill of Exchange, and writes upon the back of it;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For me, Pay the Contents of this Bill unto Mr.</hi> S. M. <hi>or order, Value received of my self</hi> (or in any other case naming him of whom the Value was received) <hi>in</hi> London, <hi>the</hi> 16 July, 1677. J. W.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. M.</hi> hath occasion to pay Mony to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he Endorses it to <hi>G. S.</hi> and so he to another, and sometimes to seven or eight, until at last the Bill is paid; and this is the meaning of an <hi>Endorsement.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>That is a set time that is limited to have the Mony paid at from the Date of the Bill; and that is according to the Custom of the Countries where the Bills are made, and in which they are payable.</p>

               <p>Pray Sir let me know how I may be sure to know when a Bill of Exchange is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99634:60"/>
due, that I may not run my self into this Labyrinth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You having understood what <hi>Usance</hi> is, as I have before told you, you must next to that take care of the Date the Bill is drawn at.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray let me see, by some Example, how I shall know when a Bill of Exchange is due: As suppose I have a Bill of 500 Crowns from <hi>Paris,</hi> due in <hi>London,</hi> drawn the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> New Stile.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must understand what <hi>Usance</hi> is: When I say <hi>Usance</hi> is 1 month, it is not to be understood that it is a month of 28 days, as many Persons do reckon, nor is it 31 days, but <hi>Usance</hi> is compleatly from such a day of <hi>May</hi> to the same day of <hi>June,</hi> or from such a day <hi>May</hi> to such a day of <hi>July</hi> is <hi>double Usance;</hi> so that you must mind the Date of your Bill, that the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> will be the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> in <hi>London:</hi> then go back 10 days, because it is New Stile, and you will find it is the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> unto which add the three days, according to the custom of the Place you live in, and you will find it is the <hi>13th</hi> day of <hi>July</hi> your Bill is due. But for this, and many more Rarities and Nicities, and good Observations upon Bills of Exchange, I refer you to a little Book, and some Tables of Mr. <hi>Jo. Marius,</hi> printed in <hi>London</hi> 1674, who treats fully of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99634:60"/>
this matter of <hi>Exchanges,</hi> and the nature of <hi>Bills;</hi> and this shall suffice for me to tell you at present.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But before you break off, pray tell me what I must do in case a Man do not pay the Bill at the day it is due, must I send back the Bill presently?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No, that would be too much rigour, and too much hard usage: you may with safety, when you have done your diligence by Protesting it in time, keep the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change one Post or two by you, but send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Protest; for it is possible, and it so falls out many times, that many a good substantial Merchant may be put to such a pinch, that he may not have Mony by him that Night his Bill is due, but the next Day he may have Mony enough; for this would be a means to ruin a Man's Reputation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What must I do next, if the Bill rest unpaid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must see if any Merchant will pay it for the honour of the Drawer, or of any of the Endorsers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What then is meant by seeing if any other Man will pay it for the honour of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> or any of the <hi>Endorsers?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning of it is this; That though the Person the Bill is drawn upon will not pay it; yet peradventure some others may, for the honour of the Drawer:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99634:61"/>
And to endeavour that, you must go to the Exchange, when you see the Man will not pay it that it is Drawn upon, and there you may enquire if any Person will pay such a Bill for the honour of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> or of any of the <hi>Endorsers:</hi> and there you will find some body undoubtedly that will, and he must pay you the Principal and the Charges of the Protest, and Interest, if any due, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But what must I do if I will pay it my self for the honour of any of the <hi>Endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi> or the <hi>Drawer?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>In case you will do so, you must go to a <hi>Publick Notary,</hi> and intimate your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of paying this Bill in that nature; and then he will make a Protest, and declare pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly that such a day such a Man paid the said Bill for the honour of <hi>A. B. Drawer,</hi> or <hi>P. C. Endorser.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>And when I have so done, what must I do with the Bill and the Protest?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must draw out a small Accompt to send your Friend, in which you must put, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>This Accompt being drawn out so, you must in the next place draw it upon the Man for whose Accompt you paid it, and he is bound by the Laws of Merchants to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Bill, and pay it, and give you thanks for stepping in, and so upholding his Credit: for it is a great discredit unto the Drawer, or any of the Endorsers, when a Bill of Exchange comes back and is not paid for his honour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you when you speak of a Letter of Credit for so much Mony? Is not that the same thing as a Bill of Exchange, being they both bring Mony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No: there is a great deal of difference betwixt a Bill of Exchange, and a Letter of Credit: the one mentions a certain sum of Mony at a certain Price and Time; and the other is an Order, if <hi>J. T.</hi> want any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, from such a Sum to such a Sum, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with it, and to take his Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or Bills, on him that doth give the Letter of Credit.</p>
               <p>This Letter of Credit is not to be Sealed, but is to be carried open by him who is the Bearer; and it is convenient it be written in words at length the whole body of it,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99634:62"/>
because it is less subject to be counterfeited by any body.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By <hi>Brokerage,</hi> I mean not that which is called with us a <hi>Pawn-Broker,</hi> (many of which are very great Extortioners, or a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sort of People, not fit to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, or have any dealing with Merchants); but <hi>Brokers</hi> are Persons generally that have had misfortunes in the World, and have been bred Merchants, (or else they are not capacitated to be <hi>Brokers)</hi> for they must be Men that have experience in Goods, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, in Scasons for buying and selling: They must be Men faithful, and of Repute, for the things they are entrusted with are of great consequence; and these Men are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed betwixt Merchant and Tradesmen; and their Employment is, to find the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant a Shopkeeper, or other Chapman for his Goods.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir make it a little plainer to me, for I cannot imagin wherein these Men are so necessary, and why they must be such skilful faithful Men, and Men of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>That I shall; and the better to do it, we will suppose your Master hath a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that is come home from beyond the Seas, and he is to sell it; He speaks to a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99634:63"/>
                  <hi>Broker</hi> upon the Exchange, and tells him, I have such a Commodity. The <hi>Broker's</hi> work is then to find out a Man fit to buy it; the Merchant and the Buyer meet together; the Merchant he demands 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Buyer he bids 4 <hi>s.</hi> they part, and cannot agree. The <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s work is to endeavour to bring them to an Agreement, the one to raise of his Offer, the other to abate of his Demands. When he hath so done, he is to note it in a Book for that purpose, where he sets the Day of the Month, and the Bargain at large, who Sells, and who Buys; at what Price, and at what Time: and for his pains he hath for every hundred pounds worth of Goods, ten shillings for himself. If the Bargain comes to nothing, (although he have been four or five days upon it) he can demand nothing for his pains, unless the Merchant will be so civil as to consider him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, wherein lies so much Skill, and Parts, and Faithfulness, as you express is required in these Men?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>In many particulars he must have skill in the Commodity he buys and sells, or else he will take a Pig for a Dog, and call one thing another; and indeed herein the Ignorance of many is seen, for they have not discretion to hold their tongues, but will be talking of what they do not understand; He must have Parts and Reason, or else
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99634:64"/>
he cannot have fit Arguments to use, either to perswade Men to fall of their Demands, or to rise higher; for it's many times seen that a Bargain is lost for want of a good Tongue to express the things that must be expressed to carry on the Bargain; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times a fit word put in, as it should, causes the Bargain to go on. He must be very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or else the Man that sells, and he that buys too, may be much dammaged; for as the Merchant doth repose Trust and Credit in the <hi>Broker,</hi> so ought the <hi>Broker</hi> to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Merchant, and not perswade him for the lucre of his Brokerage, to sell his Goods to a Man he knows any thing amiss of. And on the other hand, many of them are such Rascals, that if they have not their desires, cause far more mischief than the Merchant ever intended; and many times will not speak any thing to the disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Man, (because they lie open to the Law for so doing) but they will give a nod with their Heads, that shall do his Work as much as 1000 words, especially them that are concerned in the Trade of Exchange: And therefore this City hath a commendable Custom, that they will have Security for all that are <hi>Brokers;</hi> yet of late years many <hi>Jews,</hi> and other rascally Fellows, that know little or nothing of Merchants Affairs, adventure to meddle with Brokerage, and betray many
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99634:64"/>
Men, either through Ignorance or Knavery. It is not to be denied but if our Merchants did keep up that esteem of <hi>Brokers</hi> that other Nations have of them, it would be far better for them, and they would not meet with so many Inconveniencies as they do: For if the price of Brokerage was supported and kept up, it would be a great encouragement for them to enquire well after Men; but now the smallness of their pay is not much better than Porters Wages; and the <hi>Jews,</hi> and other pitiful low-spirited. Fellows, will do their Work at a far lower rate than the Merchants used to give, and remit it of one side, so they may have it of the other. In former days the <hi>Brokers</hi> generally made in <hi>England</hi> 1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> but in Forreign Parts 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and better; and it's well if they get ⅛ <hi>per Cent.</hi> clear now.</p>
               <p>Thus much for <hi>Brokerage;</hi> which requires far more than I can say, and therefore I shall leave it, it being now grown common for Men to use them for their own ends; and when once they have sold but one Case of Goods by a <hi>Broker</hi>'s means, and know the Customers themselves, to turn <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Brokers</hi> too, and never mind the <hi>Broker</hi> more.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray now let me know what you mean when you speak of a <hi>Factor?</hi> Is not a <hi>Factor</hi> and a <hi>Merchant</hi> all one?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:99634:65"/>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a <hi>Merchant</hi> and a <hi>Factor.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every <hi>Factor</hi> is properly a <hi>Merchant,</hi> yet every <hi>Merchant</hi> is not a <hi>Factor.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir let me know what a <hi>Factor</hi> is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Factor</hi> is one that buys or sells Goods for another Man's Accompt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a certain Sallery for his pains, but is not to run any manner of Risque, or Hazard; if the Goods be lost, or burnt, or any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happen, he is not to bear it: And for the bad Debts (if there happen any) the <hi>Factor</hi> is not to bear it, unless he goes contrary to his Order that doth employ him, then in such cases the <hi>Factor</hi> is to bear the loss, and not the Proprietor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir let me know an Instance, or an Example of what you say.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose you have a parcel of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's for the Accompt of a Merchant at <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and the Goods are not come to your hands, but perish at Sea, that is nothing to you: but if they come to your hands, and you have a true Order from him for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the same, and paying the Custom, should of your own head, or by any accident or mistake, enter the Goods false, and the same should be seized, the loss would lie at your door: or if he orders you to sell these Goods for ready Mony, and you sell them for one
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99634:65"/>
Month, or for any Time, and the Debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bad, it will lie at your door. And so in the buying any manner of Goods, if the Goods be not according to Order, the Man may refuse them when he hath received them, and the dammage shall fall upon you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, what satisfaction then hath a Man for all these hazards he runs as a <hi>Factor.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Factorage is done at several Prices, in several Places, according to the Custom of the Country; in some Countries they take 8 and 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> as at <hi>Barbadoes, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, Virginia,</hi> and most of those Western Parts: In others 2 ½ &amp; 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> as generally throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> as in <hi>France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. 1 ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> as in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other Places: but the generality only take throughout <hi>Europe</hi> 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What then am I to observe to be a very exact <hi>Factor?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Your chief Work is to observe your Orders with all manner of watchfulness, and abide by them, unless you have a general Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>(Ordre Libre)</hi> that every thing is left to your own liberty, then may you act as for your self, and nothing can ever be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What is the General Order you speak of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>It is this: If a Man do order you to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99634:66"/>
buy Goods, or sell Goods, and doth limit you to nothing; but for Price, Time, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Quantity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaves it to your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; then are you free: but if you are tied up in the least manner, you cannot call it an <hi>Ordre Libre,</hi> or General Order.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Is there then no difference betwixt a <hi>Merchant</hi> and a <hi>Factor</hi> but this, That what a <hi>Merchant</hi> Buys, or Sells, or Orders, he doth for his own Accompt; but when he doth it by another Mans Order, and receives a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for his Pains, it is by Factorage?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>None at all but this, setting this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, they are all one, a <hi>Merchant</hi> and a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi> And it is as great an honour to be a <hi>Factor</hi> as a <hi>Merchant;</hi> and generally, at the long-run, most Mony is gotten by them that are careful and vigilant <hi>Factors.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But what will make me a careful and vigilant <hi>Factor?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The due observing to answer all Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written to you; to answer the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of each Letter, as well as the Letter in general; to refer nothing until to morrow that can be done to day, but answer as soon as may be: To be always advising the true rising and falling of Commodities; The best Seasons to buy or sell in, which is a continual begetting of Business, and makes your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers think of that Business which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would not dream of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:99634:66"/>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But is it manners for me that am a Factor, to write to a Man when I have no Letter of his to Answer, nor any manner of Business to do, will not he think it very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Provided your Discourse be rational; as the price of Goods, the coming in or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of any Ship; the sudden rise of any Commodity, or the probability of profit in any respect whatsoever, either in buying or selling any Commodity, then is your Letter as welcome to any Man of Reason and Parts, as if it were written purposely by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and is of great concernment so to do, for it is a continual keeping a Trade on foot. And Letters thus written are just like Seed that is sown in the Ground, it will come up one time or other, fear it not. And if the first Letters do not answer Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be not weary of continuing, for it will gain you, not only the Profit you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but the character of an ingenious care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful industrious young Man; and although that Man hath not occasion to make use of you at present, he may be sending you other Men, as occasion offers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>These things I see, and shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to follow: But what times are there that a Man must of absolute necessity write?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>When-ever you have bought or sold Goods, or shipt or unladen Goods: for if
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99634:67"/>
you have bought Goods, and do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently give advice of their being bought, your Order may be contradicted, and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel may arise, and he may pretend that the Goods could not be bought then, because he had no advice; at the best it will look with an evil Aspect, and you will go nigh to be by your Arbitrators condemned, to be sure you will be very much blamed for your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. The like for Goods sold, if any accident happen; No, saith the Proprietor, that cannot be, for I had not so much as news of my Goods being sold at such a time. When you have shipt Goods, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the very first Post fail not (and if possibly send the Bill of Lading) to give advice of it to him for whose Accompt it is shipt, and for receiving Goods the like; for many hundreds of Accidents may happen (as I said before) that you will be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for. And this is in part your duty you are to do as a Factor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose a Man break, to whom I have sold Goods for the Accompt of any of my Employers, can I make Composition with the said broken Man my self, without first writing to my Imployer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>If you have (as I mentioned before) an <hi>Ordre Libre,</hi> you may, or else that you know your Friend very well, or that it is a thing of absolute necessity; otherwise your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployer
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99634:67"/>
will recover the full of you: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good in all such cases to write the full, and have positive order what to do in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard much discourse of <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> pray Sir let me understand somewhat of it, what it is, and how I must govern my self in the calculating it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Interest</hi> is a strange thing, and cannot be imagined but by the Effects it works: It is an insensible Canker at the best, and at the most reasonable Rates; but at its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended cruelty, the Users of it cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compared to any thing than those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they call <hi>Cannibals,</hi> or Man-eaters, that are in some parts of <hi>America,</hi> who devour People alive: And may I advise you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shift you make, and what-ever pinching you go through, be sure to avoid <hi>Interest,</hi> although in its best dress, for at the best it feeds on you, and sucks out all your moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and generally ends in your total ruin; for it is scarcely imaginable what the Use of <hi>l.</hi> 100 will amount unto at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in a short time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But I have understood that in all deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, a Man must more or less have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to do with <hi>Interest,</hi> either in receiving it from others, or in paying it unto others, although not for his own Account; and therefore I would willingly know how to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99634:68"/>
work it exactly, that I might be ready to give any Accompt at any time to them that shall demand it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This indeed is very fitting, and of absolute necessity to know, for you will be laught at if you cannot answer such Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore I shall endeavour to shew you as short a way as may be, that you may not be behind-hand with any in the true Calculation of any Sum; and to make you comprehend it with the less trouble, you may consider there are three several ways for the Calculation of Interest, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The first is, when it is an even Sum for an even time.</item>
                     <item>2. Is, when it is an odd Sum for an even Time.</item>
                     <item>3. Is, when it is an odd Sum for an odd Time.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the first of these: Suppose you lend an even Sum for an even Time; this is done generally by the Head, without the trouble of taking a Pen into your hand; as if you were to allow Interest for <hi>l.</hi> 100 for 1 Year, that is <hi>l.</hi> 6; or for 2 Years, that is <hi>l.</hi> 12; or for ½ a Year, that is <hi>l.</hi> 3; and so for any Sum more or less. And this, although it be the hardest question that can be put, is scarce worth the putting Pen to Paper for it; for if it were never so big, the mind may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:99634:68"/>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>This I am sensible of; but this is of little use to Merchants. How must I do the second, that is, broken Mony at even Time? And suppose my Master order me to pay a Bond of <hi>l.</hi> 174: 6: 7 <hi>d.</hi> for a Year, with the Interest; what doth the Interest come unto at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>To do this, remember your Rule I shewed you in <hi>Folio</hi> 46. at 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to do Provision by at 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for it is all one at <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>The Interest comes unto <hi>l.</hi> 10: 9: 2 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:99634:69"/>
And if it be for any Sum, or a whole Year, this will answer it at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for 1 year: and if it be for ½ a Year, you must take half the Mony: if ¼, a quarter of it. And thus any uneven sum of Mony may have the just Interest found out, but then it must be for an even Time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But it is the last that I chiefly do aim at, To know what any broken Sum for a broken Time comes unto; for I have never seen any easie way for that, and I find it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, therefore pray let me know how to work this Question. Suppose a Bond is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me to cast up the Interest of <hi>l.</hi> 174: 6: <hi>7d.</hi> for 5 months 19 days, at 6 <hi>per Cent. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>This indeed is very necessary to know, and if a Man doth not know it, and appear to be exact in such things, he is liable to be run down in other things that he doth pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly understand very well. To do this in the exactest way, observe,</p>

                     <item>1. To bring your Sum into Pence.</item>

               <p>What-ever it is at, more or less, do it the same way, by adding to it, or substracting from it: As suppose this, <hi>l.</hi> 174: 6: 7 <hi>d.</hi> at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is <hi>l.</hi> 4: 18: 0 ¼ <hi>d.</hi> then at 9 <hi>per Cent.</hi> it is thus.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By several ways: For if you take <hi>l.</hi> 100, and put it out to Interest for 21 years; that <hi>l.</hi> 100 will swell unto <hi>l.</hi> 339: 18: 9: at the Rate the Law allows, <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How do you make that out? for I would gladly see it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Take your <hi>l.</hi> 100, and put it out;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99634:70"/>
the first year you receive <hi>l.</hi> 106: receive the <hi>l.</hi> 6, put it out to another, and at the Years end you have that <hi>l.</hi> 6, and 7 <hi>s.</hi> 2: ¼. the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of it, and the other <hi>l.</hi> 6, of the <hi>l.</hi> 100: put that out, and at the end of 21 Years you will have <hi>l.</hi> 339: 18: 9 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose that I put my hundred pounds out, and that I do receive the Interest each Quarter, that is <hi>l.</hi> 1: 10: 0: <hi>d.</hi> what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will that make?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then your <hi>l.</hi> 100 will be far more at the end of 21 Years. And if you should keep it at Interest the Age of a Man, 70 Years at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to receive yearly, then will you find a strange alteration; The same <hi>l.</hi> 100 will swell to 5900 odd pounds; and yet this is but a moderate Rate of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> what must those poor Creatures do that give 20, 30, 40, nay 50 and 60 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for the use of Mony, and yet Trade and Live?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>These People are generally divided into three several sorts, and they shelter
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99634:71"/>
themselves under the names of very good People that uphold the Poor, and without them they say it were impossible the Poor should live.</p>
               <p>The first of these, and the most reasonable is, them that lend out <hi>l.</hi> 5, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Security at all; and for this five pound they only take a Bond or Note of the Borrower's hand, if they can write; if not, a Tally: and when they pay the Borrower the Mony, they take out 10 <hi>s.</hi> of the Mony, so they lend but <hi>l.</hi> 4: 10: <hi>s.</hi> this they take for the Interest; and then every <hi>Munday</hi> five shillings must be brought them, until that the whole sum of five pounds be paid, that is, in twenty weeks. Now supposing the Persons so civil that they never Arrest, or in the least manner trouble the Borrowers, if he miss now and then a week, this is after the Rate of <hi>l.</hi> 50. <hi>per Cent. per Annum.</hi> And yet here is something to be pleaded for this: for it may be all the Friends the Borrower ever had in the World, are not able, or willing, to lend him <hi>l.</hi> 5, or <hi>l.</hi> 10. And so in many little pedling Trades, a poor Man that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious cannot (if he be never so ingenious) ever come to be a Man for himself; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he have this, he can set up, and pay 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Week with no great trouble; and here there is no Body Bound for the Man.</p>
               <p>A second sort is them they call <hi>Tally-men;</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:99634:71"/>
and these are much like the former, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the former you have Mony, and can go and lay it out again; and by your care in laying it out, save a good part of the Extortion you pay by buying with ready Mony: but here, instead of Mony you have Goods, and the <hi>Tally-man</hi> makes you pay according to your judgment in them, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your necessity for them: and here you may have any manner of Goods fitting for Man's use in a House, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>Or any manner of Houshold-Goods what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: And if he lets the Buyer have <hi>l.</hi> 10 in Goods, he generally gets 3 or 4 <hi>l.</hi> and here you must pay him back 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Week, or 8, or 9, or what you can agree upon: And if you miss, you had as good be buried alive almost, you are presently hunted from Pillar to Post, and you are at last caught, the Reckoning inflamed, and you flung into Goal.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99634:72"/>
So that generally, if 20 Men be in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalseys,</hi> the <hi>major</hi> part of them are at the Suit of some <hi>Tally-man.</hi> And this Man makes, if he is paid, at least 60 <hi>per Cent.</hi> nay it's possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble 70 or 80 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> as he buys his Goods.</p>
               <p>But the third, and last sort, is the cruel and merciless <hi>Pawn-Broker,</hi> that however the Borrower be Poor, appears to him as good a Man as can be; for he doth not demand any Credit from him, he brings him a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Pledg of Gold, Silver, Stuff, Silk, Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Mony he borrows, and receives no credit at all from the Broker; and yet see how this poor Creature is devoured. It may be a poor Man lies sick, and hath a Wise and four or five small Children; he wants Bread and Necessaries; away goes Plate, Rings, Cloaths, or what can make to sustain him in this dismal case, to the <hi>Pawn-Broker.</hi> Bring him five pounds worth, he will not lend above three pounds on it, unless it be Plate; for this <hi>l.</hi> 3 you shall pay according to the Conscience of the Lender, sometimes 40, 50, 60 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for for bearance and Bill-mony, or entring of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and well if ever you have your Goods again: for to be sure if you tarry above 1 year, you come too late, the Goods are sold, and all is gone. I my self had occasion to Pawn, in necessity, <hi>l.</hi> 440 of fresh Silks at the price they cost, and to borrow but <hi>l.</hi> 240 upon them; and having been by necessity forced to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99634:72"/>
outstay the Time; instead of having the over-plus of my Goods returned, (they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been by the Lender disposed of, as he pretended) was sued for want of Mony to satisfie the Principal and Interest, untill the Law took place; and then my <hi>Cannibal</hi> could return above <hi>l.</hi> 230 in the same Goods unsold, and take 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for his Mony.</p>
               <p>This is not all; for they are the wicked harbourers of Rogues and Thieves, who have no sooner stollen a thing, but away it's gone to the <hi>Pawn-Broker,</hi> he will lend Mony upon it, and the Borrower never fetches it out again. Whereas these People shun all open Markets, or Places, that People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly buy and sell in, for fear of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Justice, and receiving their Reward from the Magistrate: but here they are hugg'd, and are furnished with Mony; and this enriches the said <hi>Pawn-Brokers,</hi> which is so much the worser to the poor needy Person, because these Rogues give so much, the Broker will abate nothing to the poor needy Creature.</p>
               <p>And thus have I shewed you the misery of him that is constrained to take up Mony at Interest, let him go the best way he can; if it be but at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> it will eat (as you see) strangely.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, Sir, what is that that is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99634:73"/>
called <hi>Procuration</hi> and <hi>Continuation?</hi> I have heard that goes along with <hi>Interest,</hi> what may the meaning of that be?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning of <hi>Procuration</hi> is this; Suppose a Man want <hi>l.</hi> 100; he goes to a Scrivener and tells him his wants; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener tells him, he hath a Friend hath <hi>l.</hi> 100 lies by him, and if he will give him any thing for his pains and trouble, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to possess his Friend so much of the goodness of the Man, that he will procure the said <hi>l.</hi> 100 to be lent him for six Months, or twelve Months, or as they do agree: this is called <hi>Procuration,</hi> and many times 40 <hi>s.</hi> 50 <hi>s. l.</hi> 5, is given to a Procurer to obtain the lending <hi>l.</hi> 100 for twelve Months.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you then by the other that is called <hi>Continuation?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By that I mean this: That when the Borrower hath had his <hi>l.</hi> 100 twelve Months, it is called in, and must be paid, and the Lender is in extream want of his Mony, he hath a Child to Marry by such a Day, or he hath a Purchase, and the Mony is to be paid by such a Day, and he cannot tarry: The Borrower he is at a stand, and knows not how to pay; away runs he to the Procurer, tells him of the Letter he hath received, but knows not in the least manner how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Contents of it. The Procurer makes a hard matter of it: but however,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99634:73"/>
provided he may have a small Spill for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it may be 40 <hi>s.</hi> 50 <hi>s.</hi> nay <hi>l.</hi> 5. as he can weather the Point, he will see to get his Friend supplied another way, or he will get him to tarry; and this that is given in this manner is called <hi>Continuation-Mony;</hi> and it is given upon the condition to continue the Mony 6 Months, or 12 Months longer, as occasion shall present it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you Sir, I am now well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied as to this: But what is that Interest I hear them talk of that they call <hi>Discompt,</hi> or <hi>Discompting</hi> a Sum of Mony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This is when a Shopkeeper, or any other ows you a Sum of Mony, and this Mony is to be paid at 12 Months, and you are willing to allow him the Discompt, if instead of paying you at 12 Months, he will pay you presently.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What do you mean when you say <hi>Discompt?</hi> is not that Interest?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; that is Interest, at 6, 8, or 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> as you shall agree.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Oh then I am well, I must abate him the Interest of his Mony for 12 Months; and to do that, I must cast it up as you have already shewed me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; although <hi>Discompt</hi> be properly Interest, you must not cast it up the same way, but another way.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot comprehend that: for if I am to receive <hi>l.</hi> 100 of a Man 12 Months hence, and I receive it now, and allow him the Interest at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> then am I to receive <hi>l.</hi> 94, there is nothing clearer than that.</p>

The reason of it is this; That if you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Sum of <hi>l. 6,</hi> then you allow the full interest of <hi>l.</hi> 100: but you do not receive the Sum of <hi>l.</hi> 100; and wherefore should you allow the Interest for <hi>l.</hi> 100? you must only allow the Interest of what you do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and the Sum you are to receive you cannot guess at.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir, I think I can guess at it: for if the Debt be <hi>l.</hi> 100 for one Year, then I am to take <hi>l. 6</hi> out, and so I receive but <hi>l. 94;</hi> and therefore must allow the Interest of <hi>l. 94:</hi> and thus I can see what Sum I am to receive and take it off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This is true, for a single even Sum of <hi>l.</hi> 100, or <hi>l.</hi> 200: but then suppose you have an odd broken Sum, as <hi>l.</hi> 122: <hi>11:</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> for 3 Months, how will you know exactly what you must receive? I know no manner of way but one that is true, and exact, and that is by this Rule, as I have already shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:99634:75"/>

                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>So that for the <hi>Discompt</hi> you must allow out of the <hi>l.</hi> 122: 11: 4 <hi>d.</hi> you were to receive, the Sum of <hi>l.</hi> 1: 16: 2: ¾ <hi>d.</hi> Thus,

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:99634:76"/>
And thus have I shewed you this Rule: for many Men, though they have lived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, and received many thousands of pounds, know not this distinction, and so may lose very much in the Year.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>This is very true: but yet me-thinks the difference cannot be much; I should think it scarce worth the while for us to mind such Trifles, and Men will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves with it if it be but a Trifle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>But when you pass for a Merchant, I assure you you will find it a difficult matter so to do; for they that see your Bills of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and find that they are not cast up so, will take you to be very weak in your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and very lavish in your Purse, and will all say, you were never bred a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; and because I would have you know the Difference, I am willing to demonstrate it yet more plain to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir let me see a demonstration of it by two different Bills of Parcels, one the common way, and the other this way you are now endeavouring to teach me.</p>

               <p>That I will do, and am the more willing to dwell the longer upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, because I daily meet with them that have been old Traders, and experienced Men, and yet are ignorant of it; and I hate to think a Man should pretend to pass for a Merchant, and yet the Shop-keeper stand and laugh in his Sleeve to see his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and folly; and not only cheat him of his Mony, but jeer him when he is gone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I shall observe what you say, and do it.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bottomree</hi> is indeed a very strange thing, for it eats out sleeping and waking; and as Men do now subtilly use it, it is one of the greatest Advantages that can be made of Mony, and with little or no hazard, which makes the Profit the larger; and this is very much used at this time we live in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir what is the nature of it, and from whence takes it this name?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>It hath its Name derived from the Bottom of the Ship, or Keel, and is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in this manner: A Master of a Ship is going for <hi>India,</hi> the <hi>Straits, Turkie,</hi> &amp;c. and he wants <hi>l.</hi> 100 to carry out in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities he thinks he can make a profit by; you lend him <hi>l.</hi> 100, and agree with him to have for this <hi>l.</hi> 100, <hi>l.</hi> 130, or <hi>l.</hi> 140, or <hi>l.</hi> 150, (or what you can agree for) at the Ships return: But if the Ship do happen
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99634:78"/>
to be Sunk, Burnt, Taken, or any manner of dammage happen that the Ship comes not home, then you cannot recover one peny of the Mony that you lent, of the Man that borrowed it, nor arrest his Body: for he is to pay you at the return of the Ship, and not at the return of his Person.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How then can this be so profitable as you do make it to be? He may be lost at Sea.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The general way now is, to lend a Man <hi>l.</hi> 100 at 30 or 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and then find out one that will assure the Ship Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Inwards for a small matter, it may be 4, 5, 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> the longest Voyage: and if the Ship be lost, he recovers his Mony of the Insurer: and thus he is upon certain grounds; for he that lends his Mony at <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomree,</hi> and Insures it, generally (if the Ship come home safe, or is lost at Sea) gains at least 22 or 23 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> And Men now-adays are so cunning, that they will not only have part of the Ship mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto them, but will have some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, or sufficient Man or other, that shall be engaged for it, and so have the Borrower's Bond as well as the Ship, and his Body bound as well as the Voyage. And this many that are necessitous, rather than leave the Mony, will run into; but they seldom run out of it again, and do spoil the true
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99634:79"/>
intent of lending Mony at <hi>Bottomree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This way of taking up of Mony, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise much used amongst Masters of Ships that by any bad Weather, or other strait or immergency whatsoever, do put into any Port in any Kingdom, and there they repair their Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and buy what is necessary for them; and wanting Mony to do the same with, they repair to some Merchant; and he having the Ships Name and the Master's, and of what Place she is, and her Owners Names, will advance this Mony at <hi>Bottomree;</hi> and if the Ship comes safe to her intended Port, the said Merchant hath his Mony; if not, and the Ship be lost, he hath nothing; nor can he recover any thing against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or Owners, but only against the Ship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But doth not this cause many Cheats, and many Men to lose their Ship on purpose, that they may not pay the Mony which they took up at <hi>Bottomree?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; and several Men have brought their Ships safe to the Rivers Mouth, and there they have sunk them, on purpose to avoid the paiment of the Monies they owed at <hi>Bottomree,</hi> and have been detected and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for it as it hath deserved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Is there any thing else that I can learn, that may be beneficial unto me belonging to this <hi>Bottomree?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing as I know: but if you have
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99634:79"/>
occasion ever to take up Mony at <hi>Bottomree</hi> your self, do it at as cheap a Rate as you can; and if you lend out Mony, be sure to have to do, as near as you can, with honest Men: for many times there is a great cheat under it, as to the Voyages themselves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, how can that be? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any manner imagin that to be so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose you lend <hi>l.</hi> 100 unto <hi>A. B.</hi> the Master of a Ship, and he lives at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and goes from <hi>Bristol</hi> to <hi>Cadiz;</hi> you that lend the Mony live at <hi>London;</hi> the Master goes from <hi>Bristol,</hi> and instead of 1 Voyage, makes 2 or 3 Voyages: It doth very often happen so, if you have not Friends in the same Town that give you notice of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. And thus you run two or three Risques for one, and sometimes come to make a real loss, when as in truth your Risque was run a great while before. But herein you are in the fault as much as the Master that cheats you, for you are to look out and enquire, and not to tarry for his sending you word: which is just as if you should wait until your Debtor sends you word your Bond is due.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Having now spoken in this Matter of letting out Mony at <hi>Bottomree,</hi> I pray Sir let me know what the meaning of <hi>Assurance</hi> is, for your tell me I may Ensure for 4, 5, or 6, <hi>per Cent.</hi> Outwards and Inwards.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Assurance</hi> is, when a Man is in any manner of fear of the Ship his Goods are in, or the danger of the Voyage, or of Pirats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He then is willing to give another Man a certain sum of Mony to put himself in your place; and if any danger arises, to pay you for the same Goods the value that you have Assured. It is a thing hath been long in custom and use amongst Traders, and was established by a Law under <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> before the birth of our Saviour <hi>Christ;</hi> it hath been much practised in all Trading Nations, and is a cause of great increase of Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that hazard is born by four or five with mutual consent, which otherwise must fall upon one Person.</p>

               <p>And is this what is required to secure a Man, and all that is necessary to be known as to Insurance? are there not more sorts of Insurances?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; there are several sorts of Insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: as for Example; These are for Goods that you ship out of <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Cadiz,</hi> &amp;c. but you may have occasion likewise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Goods from <hi>Cadiz</hi> to <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>What must I do then? Supposing this last Post I had advice that there was 10 Tuns of Oil shipped for my Master's Accompt on board the <hi>Swallow,</hi> Captain <hi>George Grantham</hi> Commander, from <hi>Leghorn.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must immediately go to the Office, and agree with the Insurers what you shall give them for Insurance, and then get your <hi>Policy</hi> made, and signed by them, and pay them the <hi>Primo,</hi> and cause your <hi>Policy</hi> to be entred, and the Work is the self-same as the Goods you sent outwards, except that Passage that is changed, <hi>[these are on board of a Ship coming home]</hi> and you alter the Ships Name, and Masters Name, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it <hi>comes home,</hi> instead of <hi>going out.</hi> And here it is to be noted, that if a Master of a Ship takes in your Goods, and cannot come up with his Ship to the Wharf or Key to unload, and an Accident, as Wet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> happen to your Goods, the Assurers are to make good the same until the Goods be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99634:83"/>
landed. And all Assurances are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenour of the <hi>Policy,</hi> some for Goods that go out, and come home; some for Goods that go out, and are sold, and the Provision, or the Nete procede comes home. Other Assurances are made upon the Ship it self, with its Tackle and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto it; and the Assurers are bound to make good all that is worn or torn for a Voyage at a price that is agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Other Assurances are made upon Goods that are sent by Wagon, or Cart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Land, from all Robbers, or Thieves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other Assurances are made upon the Lives of Men and Women, at a Rate that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. For by this means if you buy any Place or Office that is worth <hi>l.</hi> 4000, or <hi>l.</hi> 5000, more or less, and you have not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enough to purchase it, you borrow 2 or 3000 <hi>l.</hi> Now if you die, and are not in a condition to pay this Mony, it is lost: But if you ensure your Life, then your Friends that you did borrow it of, will have their Mony honestly paid them. And herein is a great conveniency to all Parties that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and it is of a general use to all sorts of Persons.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But are there not many Frauds and Cheats in all these Assurances?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, there are many Cheats; but in that, as in all other matters, you must be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99634:84"/>
very careful that you are not drawn in; for there are scarce any Mysteries in the World where there are not some Cheats.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray let me know wherein in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability I may be deceived.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>If you should insure another Man; it may be he knows of the loss of Ship or Goods before he comes to cause it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, and in this case it is a Cheat, which hath many times so happened.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>What Remedy have I against him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You need not pay him the Mony; for the Law will rather punish him, than give it unto him. Another common Cheat there is for Fraighting of a Ship, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a pretended Voyage, and ensure much upon her, and then order her to sink or founder down right in fair Weather at Sea, where the Men may save their lives in the Long-boat. Others will venture to pay a small Assurance for several times upon Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels in Winter time, upon hopes they will be cast away. And many things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which the only means you have for your safety is, To have to do with Persons that have a clear and good Reputation, and are honest Men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I understand well what <hi>Insurance</hi> is: but pray, Sir, now let me have two or three words of Explication upon the <hi>Policy of Assurance,</hi> of what is meant by <hi>Danger of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99634:84"/>
Seas, Men of War, Fire, Enemies, Pirats, Rovers, Thieves, Jettezones, Letters of Mart, Barratry of the Master,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>These need no great Explication, the words do carry it in themselves for the most part; but however I will satisfie you as far as I can. The losses at Sea are, when by any Accident what-ever the Ship is cast away, or foundred at Sea; or when Thieves or Pirats, or Men of War, in any manner do take and carry away the said Ships of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or the Goods, (here you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one thing, That if any Thieves are on Ship-board, the Master must pay for that, and not the Assurers) then the Assurers are lyable unto it. <hi>Letters of Mart</hi> are given out by one Prince, against the Subjects of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince, when they cannot by their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions have justice done them: and then those that have these <hi>Letters of Mart,</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful to get all they can from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are against. And there are dangers again, for Arrests of Kings and Princes, that are called an <hi>Embargo,</hi> and are upon immergent Occasions practised here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in other Parts; and this <hi>Embargo</hi> signifies, that when any State Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, the Ships are stopped throughout the Kingdom; and being all stopped, there may be much dammage to some of them that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99634:85"/>
are laden with Corn, Fruit, Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is to be born by the Assurers.</p>
               <p>Also against <hi>Barratry of the Master,</hi> if he sell or imbezel any of the Goods, and doth turn them to his own use, or runs away with the Ship, the Assurers must make it good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Party that hath caused himself to be assured. And thus much may suffice for <hi>Assurance.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How shall I work this by Arithmetick: If a Master of a Ship hath brought in for Dammage 3 or 4, more or less <hi>per Cent.</hi> for Dammage that the Assurer must allow; how shall I know what each Ensurer must allow when they have ensured unequal Sums?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Very easily; Let me know what your Sums are, and I will presently shew you what you do desire to know.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>The Dammage is 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> And,</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>So soon as you hear of a certain that a loss is happened, you must enquire at the Office for the Assurers, (if you know them not) and acquaint them of the Loss, and how you come to know it, and desire them to inform themselves of the truth of it, if they please.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Well; suppose they are satisfied with my report, will they pay me my Mony down?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; there is generally an abatement of 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for prompt payment; but if they be punctual Men that value their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, they will presently pay it.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What if they are not punctual Men?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then they will shuffle and put you off much, and will endeavour to find out flaws, and raise scruples for a larger abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than ordinary; and sometimes will keep you a year or two out of your Mony, and many times never pay; but generally get in case of loss 15 or 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> abated, I have known 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> abated, upon very small pretentions; which makes a common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb about such Ensurers, <hi>What is it worth to ensure the Assurers?</hi>

                  <hi>Contribution</hi> is understood many ways;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99634:87"/>
as when a Man breaks, and his Creditors (or some of them) meet together, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute each Man to give somewhat in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick way, to endeavour to get him, or to secure part of his Estate. It is also meant, when any sum of Mony is given to a Pirat to release a Ship and Goods, which is for the good and benefit of the whole, and therefore the whole do joyn each with the other to raise the Mony that was given. In short, it is meant by any Act where two or three, or ten or twelve, more or less meet, and join each Man proportionably his Mony towards the carrying on any design.</p>

               <p>You have now explained this unto me, and in doing of it, you have gone into another thing which I desire to be informed of, what is meant by it, and that is, when you say they contribute together when a Man Breaks; pray let me know what is meant by that word <hi>Breaking.</hi>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99634:87"/>
sometimes demand only time for the paiment of the whole Debt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giving Security to pay it at a certain time, or upon his own Security to pay it, without the getting any other Person to be bound for him.</p>

Now the thing I desire to know is, what Proposals there are generally made to Men in such cases: and if it should happen to fall out to my lot to be summoned in so, I may know what to say, and how to act in it; and if I take any of the Proposals, what I must do.</p>

               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>From 5 <hi>s.</hi> to 15 <hi>s.</hi> is lookt upon to be a good Composition; and in giving for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>s, &amp;c. per l.</hi> the Man is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and hath a Release in full; and is in Law as well discharged, as if he paid the entire Debt of <hi>l.</hi> 100.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; in such cases General Releases are given on both sides; because all matters are then ended betwixt Man and Man.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>It is done in this manner; The Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor absents, and offers to give you 10 <hi>s.</hi> in the pound in Mony, and 10 <hi>s.</hi> upon Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Security is to be understood two ways, either Personal, or Real: if Personal, then another Man is bound with the Party that is the Debtor, to pay the Mony at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, if the Debtor do not. If it be Real,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99634:90"/>
then it is the making over some Land, Lease, House, or Goods, by a Deed for that purpose.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Well; Suppose this Man for this <hi>l.</hi> 100 give me 10 <hi>s. per</hi> pound in ready Mony, and 5 <hi>s.</hi> upon Personal Security; Mr. <hi>J.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The Man owes <hi>l.</hi> 100. For the Mony you receive 10 <hi>s.</hi> in the pound, is <hi>l.</hi> 50. For the Bond you make it thus.</p>

               <p>Here you must likewise have the help and assistance of a Scrivener: for Merchants do not understand these Conveyances as they are to be made according to Law, and so it is convenient to have good advice in this matter. But if it be but a small Debt, and your Debtor give you a Note for the same, and you go and get promise of the paiment of that Note to you before Witness, it is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99634:92"/>
good; and nothing else can secure you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Man be not a Bankrupt at the time of making this Promise; for then it is void, or any Act he doth.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By that is meant, that if Mr. <hi>J. J.</hi> your Debtor cannot pay you in Mony, nor Security, or you do not take his own Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but he promises to give you your Debt out in Goods, as Mr. <hi>T. B.</hi> and <hi>W.

               <p>Yes; as you are concerned with any private Bargain you make with him, or any for him: but if you do prosecute him by Law, then the case is altered, and you must advise with your Lawyer, for I cannot tell you what to do in that Matter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No, I have no skill in them in the least, nor do they belong to a Merchant as a Merchant to know, being rather the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Soliciter; a Merchant ought not to be in Law upon any account if he can avoid it.</p>

               <p>As much as you can, avoid going to Law, rather refer it to knowing Merchants, who can best decide it. Your Lawyers will magnifie the goodness of your Cause, whilst they can find Mony coming; but when they find the Client is poor, <hi>Truly</hi> (say they) <hi>I think you had e'ne best refer it to some indifferent Persons.</hi> Most judicious Merchants do as much as they can to avoid Law-Suits, for it doth not agree with their Business in the least.</p>

               <p>If I might advise you, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider well of what I were going about, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Man were worth my charge and pains before I began with him; for if he be poor, then you make him poorer, and that's not the way to pay your Debt: If he be Knavish, a Prison will encrease that: If he is Rich, and goes to Prison, he pays nothing, but spends your Estate in a Prison, and laughs at you. The prudence of our Fore-fathers was, what-ever they did, to keep the Body out of a Prison; and our Nation has always been very tender of the Liberty of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that until the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third there was no Law in force for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of the Body of any Man for Debt. It is terrible to consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands of poor Families sink under the burden, become a charge to the Nation, and are forced to be idle Droans; which if they were at liberty, might not only provide for themselves and Families, but set many thousands at work, who are now altogether useless.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What must I then do with any that owe me Mony, and will not pay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This is a very difficult matter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; any Remedy is better than a Prison: And this we see in our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:99634:99"/>
who cast none into Prison; and if the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor will have his Debtor there, he must be at the charge to keep him; which makes very few Prisoners. But our cunning monied Men in <hi>England</hi> that are politick, use another way; and that is, Suppose the Debtor owes them <hi>l.</hi> 100; they will lend him 30 or 40 <hi>l.</hi> more unto it; and endeavour to hedg it in, by getting it some way or other made sure to them, as by taking a Mortgage, or get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Judgment, or by small paiments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of these things your own Experience must be the best Judg; for nothing else can do it so well as your own Judgment: Still having regard to these old and good Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, That <hi>a Prison pays no Debts.</hi> That <hi>the first Offer is generally the best:</hi> That <hi>when the first is refused, it seldom rises higher.</hi> Besides, <hi>of ten Men that are put into Prison, nine of them either die there, or besot themselves so much, that when they come out, they are fit for nothing but Gaming or Drinking.</hi> And if this be the way to pay Debts, let any reasonable Man judg; whereas if they were out, and had a little respit, they might be able to pay every Man in some time. And as a clear demonstration of this, you see those Men that run quite away, and get into other Countries, do live and get Estates. Now what is the reason of this? Not that they are more ingenious there than they would be here; or that they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99634:99"/>
can attain to know more there, it cannot be: For what Man can know more in a strange Nation, than in a Nation where he hath always been bred, and hath gain'd and paid for Experience? It is not that, but this; If a poor Man is in Debt, every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy worries him from one place to another; some Arrest him, others frighten him, others revile him; and in short, so soon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to get any thing about him, some Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors are so hasty with him, that they will not give him time to get himself in a way to satisfie his whole Credit, nay not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the necessities of his Family: And this is the reason many Debts prove bad, which would otherwise be good; and therefore I think it would be the best course to give poor Men some respeit, and time to brath: and it were rather policy to help them, than pull them down. See for your clearer light and direction in this, what the Law of God saith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 1, 2. <hi>At the end of every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years thou shalt make a Release. And this is the manner of the Release; Every Creditor that lendeth ought unto his Neighbour, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease it; he shall not exact it of his Neighbour, or Brother, because it is called the Lord's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease.</hi> But poor Men now-adays come far short of this, for their chiefest desires are but to have some short time of respeit to pay what they owe; and yet some Creditors are
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99634:100"/>
so unreasonable, that if they should ask this, it would be thought ridiculous. They ask but a reasonable breathing-while, and in other Cases it is granted. Many things may be fit Emblems to shew us the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Tarrying. <hi>The Bow bent, shoots far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest when its let loose. The Mastiff is most furious when he is drawn off his Prey, and kept some time at rest.</hi> Many other Instances might be given, too long here to be inserted. But the chiefest inducement to believe it is this; We have seen by daily experience, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poor Men by having Mercy shewed them and Patience, have come to pay every Man his due: But where can you find any Man known to lie in Prison until his Debts were paid?</p>
               <p>But this is a digression from the Subject I should treat on, only it will lie in your way one time or other have to do with Men that are low, and then you may call to mind what I have said, and comparing them to the condition you shall then happen to be in, you will find, by your own Reason and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which is the best way. I must confess, for Villains and Men that make no reckoning or esteem of themselves, or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their ways, a Prison is the fittest place; and such a punishment is too little for them, they deserve a greater. But we will leave off this Discourse, and proceed to somewhat else.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>This I am as yet ignorant of, and know not how things may change before I come into the World; but as for the several ways of getting in Debts, pray let me know what they are, that I may know how to act in some measure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This is the work of a Lawyer, and I am not capable of giving directions fully therein; but what I know I will acquaint you withal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>That will do well, Sir, and I shall hereafter, as I have occasion, enquire into the Particulars of them that are versed in the Law for the Nicities.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose that a Man owe you Mony, and you follow him, and he puts you off; these are usually the ways to sue him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the <hi>Court of Conscience,</hi> and this is only for Debts that are under forty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and takes cognizance only of such as are owing by Freemen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting within the said City, or the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof: Here you cause the Debtor to be warned in, and must refer the Matter to Commissioners appointed by the Lord Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you must abide by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the said Commissioners. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Poverty is pleaded, and the Debtor
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99634:101"/>
is ordered to pay so much <hi>per</hi> Week, 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 12 <hi>d.</hi> or what the Court thinks fit; or else Execution is taken out against him: You are believed for what you demand upon your Oath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second way of proceeding that is civil, is to make an <hi>Atachment</hi> of your Debtor's Estate, Monies, or Goods, that you understand is due to him from <hi>A. B. J. C, &amp;c.</hi> in the Mayor's, or either of the Sheriffs Courts; and this doth not hurt the Person of him that owes the Mony, but only secures the Debt, and is no very great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the Debtor, nor any great Charge, and is done with much privacy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third way is, If you have any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with a Man, and have a mind not openly to disparage him, you acquaint him you intend to enter an Action against him in such a <hi>Counter,</hi> and he will do well to put in Bail by such a day; this is a great piece of civility, if you must go to Law, and saves Mony on both sides that is given to Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth way is, when you fear your Man indeed, and do really think to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him, then you give order to an Officer to take him into custody; you first enter your Action at one of the <hi>Counters,</hi> and pay your <hi>Sergeant;</hi> and when the <hi>Sergeant</hi> hath him, you have the <hi>Sheriff</hi> for your Security,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99634:101"/>
if the Party makes any escape, or the Bail be not good.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth is, by way of a <hi>Writ</hi> from the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> or the <hi>Common-Pleas;</hi> and here the Party is held to special Bail before a Judg, and must give in Bail here below, and above too; and this is troublesom for the Debtor, and also chargeable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A sixth way is, by <hi>Outlawry;</hi> and this is very rigorous, and a Man now-adays by the baseness of an Attorney, is sued to an <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry,</hi> and knows nothing of it, but is quiet, and means no body harm; and here he is ruined, and run up to much charge before he knows wherefore he is troubled.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Is a Commission of <hi>Bankrupt;</hi> and this is many ways convenient, but exceeding chargeable. The meaning of it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> directed to such and such Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, naming five or more, directing them to enquire into all the particulars of the Man's condition that is failed. They have power to administer an Oath, to send to Prison, to release out of Prison; they can break open Houses, seize Goods, sell them, extend Lands, and in short, do any thing for the advantage of the Creditors; and at last make a Treasurer, and cause a Divident to be made to the Creditors. But a Statute cannot be taken out against a Man, unless one
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99634:102"/>
or more Creditors join together, or the Sums amount to more than <hi>l.</hi> 100; and they must give security to prove the Man a Bankrupt. This is a very rigorous manner of Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and generally leaves the Estate far worse than they found it, for it is very chargeable and tedious. These be the several ways that are used to get Mony in, and to Prosecute Men; what more there are I know not, you must inquire into it of them that are learned in the Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But how if I am imployed by another to prosecute any Man here, how must I act it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>In the same nature as is before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but you must have power from the Man that employs you.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; that is not sufficient, you must have a <hi>Procuration,</hi> so called in all Forreign Parts, and by us in <hi>England</hi> a <hi>Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> that impowers you to sue his Debtor, cast him in Prison, and release him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Pray let me see what one of these <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Attorney</hi> is, and how you do make them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Letter of Attorney</hi> is made several ways: Sometimes to sue one single Man, and sometimes to sue many; or to receive Mony of some; freight Ships, make Contracts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:99634:102"/>
But usually it is made general, and then thus.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>It is, to give the same Power to a Man in <hi>London,</hi> to act and do, as if the Man at <hi>Bristol</hi> came up himself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I am very well satisfied with what you are pleased to say, and I think I understand the meaning of it at present: Pray let me know now what is meant by that Expression which I have often heard used, and that is <hi>Manufacture.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manufacture</hi> is, when a Man inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the making a Commodity that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made or used before in the place where he lives, and when no body maketh it but himself, it is called his <hi>Manufacture:</hi> as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you would make <hi>Buckrams,</hi> a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that was never made in <hi>England</hi> before, and that none is made but by you, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led your <hi>Manufacture,</hi> or the <hi>Manufacture</hi> of <hi>Buckrams.</hi> And so of any other, each Nation having its peculiar sorts of Goods, which it doth make, as <hi>England</hi> for the <hi>Manufacture</hi> of Cloth, Serges, Bays, Stuffs, Says, <hi>&amp;c. Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for Linen Cloth. <hi>France</hi> for Lockrams, Dowlas, Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What then is that they call <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>That is, when a number of Men, or one Man, endeavours to get all that is to be gotten of one Commodity into his own
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99634:104"/>
hands; and when he hath it, to raise it to what price he pleaseth: or when several Men will join to buy and sell at what price they please; and so by this means the Trade they drive; is brought to nothing for others: For they grind the Poor on both sides; they give what they please for a Commodity, and because none can buy it but them, they will give you less, or else keep your Commodity to spoil: And when the Poor come to buy, they must give what they please, or they shall have none. And this having been found in thousands of Instances destructive to some Nations, hath been by many wise and prudent Laws forbidden in ours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What is meant by <hi>Allotting of Goods?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>This is a thing very necessary to be understood; and the meaning of it is this: Five or six Men buy a whole Ships loading of Raisins of the Sun of a Merchant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one Man is not capable of buying so great a quantity: and when they have bought them, they divide the thousand Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels; suppose into six Lots, or Parts, and make so many Mens Names on six pieces of Paper, and the first Comer-by puts the Note of each Man's Name upon each Lot or Division; and by this means the Goods are equally divided without partiality, one Man hath not a better Lot than another, and there is no cause of discontent, but all are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well satisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:99634:104"/>
Others, instead of putting pieces of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on each Lot, cannot write or read, and one gives his Knife, another his Tobacco-Box, another a Shilling, another any thing he knows again; and this is put upon the top of each Lot, and by this the Lot is known. But this latter is for a lower sort of Mechanicks, Merchants do not use it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What is meant then, Sir, by another thing I have heard them call <hi>Lots,</hi> and that is, such as are sold by the <hi>East-India Company;</hi> I have heard them say, they would go buy a Lot of Goods.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Here by a Lot of Goods is meant ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: for so many Goods are divided into so many Parts, or Lots, and notice is given of what is in each Lot, and when the price is set, there is an advance put upon it: Suppose one Lot is 50 Bags of Pepper, and they are put at 10 <hi>d. per</hi> 
                  <abbr>lb</abbr>. to advance ⅛ <hi>d. per</hi> 
                  <abbr>lb</abbr>. each bidding. One Man he bids 10 <hi>d.</hi> ¼, another 10 <hi>d.</hi> ½, another 11 <hi>d.</hi> more or less; during which time of bidding, a small piece of Wax Candle is burning, and he that bids most when the Candle goes out, he is to have the Pepper; and this is called selling Goods by the Candle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>As soon as they have bought Goods so, do they come and take them away?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; as soon as they have bought them, then they do seal and deliver a Bond
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99634:105"/>
for them, before the next Lot of Goods hath a Candle put up.</p>
            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Price-Current,</hi> is a small piece of Paper that is printed in most Places where a Trade is used, that specifies what all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Goods are worth; and that is so printed once every week, and sent by one Merchant to another; and this is called a <hi>Price-Current.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What use may a Merchant make of these <hi>Price-Currents?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>If the <hi>Price-Current</hi> be exact, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant may reap much advantage by it; for he may look into it for any Commodity he hath a mind to bring from beyond the Seas, and see what it is worth there the first peny; then see what the Charges out of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are; and then he may see what the Fraight, Custom, and other Charges are here, by a Book of Rates; and if there is Mony to be gotten by it, he may begin; but if not, he may let it alone; and so he is at a certainty for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray let me know what you mean by that you call a <hi>Book of Rates.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Book of Rates,</hi> is a little Book
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99634:107"/>
which each Kingdom hath, wherein is set down the Price that every Commodity shall pay at its Exportation, or at its Importation. And this is of great case and benefit to the Merchant; for by this the Merchant examines if his Servants or Factors do cast up their Goods aright that they pay Custom for; or (as I said before) they may see what any parcel of Goods comes unto for Custom in any Country before they send them away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you by the words <hi>Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>Importation?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning of these words are, That the Goods which are said to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,</hi> are Goods sent out from Home; and the Goods <hi>Imported,</hi> are those which are brought in and unloaded from any part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas.</p>

               <p>What is meant by those Bills I have heard much discourse of, that are called the <hi>Custom-house Bills?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>By a <hi>Custom-house Bill</hi> is meant a sheet of Paper that comes out every day, (except Holy days); in which Paper there is set down all the Goods by themselves that are Imported; and all them that are Exported by themselves: and there is put the Place they are Imported from, the Merchant's Name that Imports them, and the quantity of Goods; and so for the Exportation of Goods. A thing exceeding prejudicial to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99634:108"/>
Merchants, and which makes the Trade and Mystery of a Merchant, as free and open to a Cobler, as to a Merchant that hath been bred forty years to the Trade: for if I am a Merchant, and have been at great charge and expence to find out a fitting Place for a Commodity to be sold at, I must enter my Goods, and the Place they are bound unto, and then every Man knows what Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are fit for such and such Places: by which means if any thing is to be gotten, he that never knew any thing of Trade gets as good a price, and as much for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, as he that doth well understand it, and hath spent many hundreds of pounds to find it out.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, shew me by some Instance how this can be, for I do not very well as yet understand what you mean.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The thing I mean is this: Mr. <hi>W. S.</hi> is a Merchant, and he Ships off it may be 1000 pieces of Serges for <hi>Spain,</hi> and this stands in the <hi>Custom-house Bills</hi> thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Cadiz,</hi> W. S. 1000 Serges.</item>
                     <item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>My Cobler he comes to read this, and there he finds <hi>W. S.</hi> sends Serges for <hi>Spain,</hi> and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders such a Man is a good Man, and a wise
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99634:108"/>
standing Man, and he would not send Goods if he did not get by them, undoubtedly he gets well by them: Well, I will venture, and send some too, and so sends away a parcel likewise. And so he that found the place out, hath no more right to it than the meerest stranger. But which is worse than this, is by Traders knowing what comes into the Nation, the Merchant lies open to the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper that can tell what the Nation can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and what it needs; and if 100 Chests of <hi>China</hi> Oranges will serve the present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity for three or four days, the Shopkeeper knowing the Merchants have 4000 Chests, shall buy no more than from Hand to Mouth, and let the rest perish, unless they can have them at their price. So that (submitting nevertheless to better judgments) I think it were far better for Merchants the said Bills were not printed; I am very confident they would have more incouragement to go on chearfully in Exporting and Importing most sorts of Commodities.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard much discourse about prohibited Goods and Seizures: are not all Goods lawful to be dealt in, provided I pay for them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; there are many Goods, although you buy them, and pay for them, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry them out of the Nation, or bring them into the Nation, because they are by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99634:109"/>
Act of Parliament expresly forbidden, with Penalties upon any that shall presume to do it: And a Merchant ought to be very well advised in what he deals, for by ignorance herein many a Man hath had great losses by Seizures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir let me know what Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities they are that are generally Forbidden or Prohibited to be brought into the Nation, or go out, and what you mean by Seizures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The Commodities forbidden to be Imported, are generally such as do hinder our own Natives from Work, and there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, I shall name but few; as Ribonds of Silk, Laces white and black of Silk, Thred, or Silver; Hats, Gloves, Clothes, Stuffs, Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Ware, Bacon, Toys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by a late Act, all Goods and Commodities of the Growth &amp; Manufactory of <hi>France,</hi> as Wines, Silks, Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for them that go out, Mony either in Coin or Bullion, of Gold or Silver, Corn, and any Provisions, (unless under such a rate) Wooll, and several other things, that are too tedious to mention in this place, but may be more largely seen in the Examining those Acts of Parliament, and Statutes in force for that purpose.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Seizures:</hi> By that word is meant, the Man or Men that do find out and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver such Goods, and take the same away, and secure them as the Law doth direct;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99634:109"/>
either by carrying them to his Majesties Ware-house, or else to the next Justice of the Peace, or to the Constable's House; this is called <hi>Seizing the Goods.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>When this Officer hath thus seized them, what doth he then do with them, keep them for his own use?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>No; he hath no power over them, but must in such a certain time enter them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majesties Court of Exchequer at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> by way of Information, and then come to Trial, and so the Law passes upon them; either they are guilty, or not guilty: and if they are found guilty, each Party hath his share, as the Act of Parliament in that case doth direct: as in some Goods his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath half, and the Informer half; in others the Poor of the Parish where they are seized have half, and the Informer half; and several other ways, as the several Acts do recite.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What do they do with the Men that they take these Goods from, are they to have no punishment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, in some cases it is Felony, in others Imprisonment, in others Fines, in others treble the value of the Goods seized; and all these different, according to the Crime they are found guilty of.</p>

               <p>What mean you by that they call <hi>Smug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>Smuglers?</hi> I have heard it often tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of at the Water-side.</p>

               <p>By <hi>Smuglers</hi> is meant, the Men or Women that do convey these prohibited Goods from place to place; and by <hi>Smugling,</hi> is carrying them from place to place private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For Example: If <hi>J. D.</hi> do live at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and takes up Goods privately against Law, he is the <hi>Smugler:</hi> And if <hi>J. P.</hi> bring them in the Night to <hi>Colchester,</hi> and there <hi>D. B.</hi> and he contrives to send them to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> they are <hi>(J. P.</hi> and <hi>D. B.)</hi> both <hi>Smug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> being ordering and sending forward their Goods for that purpose.</p>

               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Waste-Book</hi> must be made of a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99634:110"/>
good midling Paper, not very fine, nor very course; and it must be ruled with a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and with <hi>Pounds, Shillings,</hi> and <hi>Pence;</hi> and herein you must put every thing that you transact, because from hence it is to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Fair Journal</hi> word for word, and this Book is only kept to book things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, because they may not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and because there may be amendments before they do come to be fairly posted into the <hi>Fair Journal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The manner of Ruling this</hi> Wast-Book <hi>is thus.</hi>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, being provided of such a Book, what is the first work that is to be done by me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The first work is to make your <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you by an <hi>Inventory?</hi> I do not understand what it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>An <hi>Inventory</hi> is properly an Accompt of all the Monies and Debts owing to you, and all the Goods, Ships, Houses, Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at that time you have by you; as likewise all the Monies you owe to any Persons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>And how must I make this <hi>Inventory?</hi> Supposing I have <hi>l.</hi> 40: 6: 8 <hi>d.</hi> in Money: <hi>l.</hi> 110: 6: 4 <hi>d.</hi> in Tobacco: <hi>l.</hi> 119: 6: 3 <hi>d.</hi> in Sugar: <hi>l.</hi> 16: 10: 4 <hi>d.</hi> due by a Man at <hi>Bristol: l.</hi> 119: 2: 11 <hi>d.</hi> by one at <hi>Exon: l.</hi> 100: 0: 0, by one at <hi>York:</hi> a quarter of a Ship, <hi>l.</hi> 250: a House <hi>l.</hi> 300: and <hi>l.</hi> 39: 4: 6 <hi>d.</hi> in Jewels and Plate; how must these be booked in my <hi>Waste-Book?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>To answer your Question, how you shall enter this first parcel of an <hi>Inventory;</hi> look but back to your own Reason, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine which must be the Debtor, and which must be the Creditor. Sundry Accompts must be Debtor, and Stock must be Creditor. And that because here you are possessed of several Goods, by making sundry Accompts Debtor, you will beget (as you will see af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards an accompt for each sort of Goods)
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99634:111"/>
Stock must be Creditor, because it is posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of such and such Goods, and then name the sum of Mony for them, and the reason of the Parcel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, proceed to the second, what must I do when I owe several Men Mony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must then make Stock Debtor, and the several Men Creditors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How must I do if I receive Mony of <hi>John Bell</hi> upon Bond, Bill, or Book?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must make Cash Debtor, and the Party of whom you receive it Creditor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How must I do when I pay any Man Mony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must make the Man Debtor, and Cash Creditor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose I take up Mony at Interest for any certain time, more or less, how must I book it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must make Cash Debtor for the Principal Mony; Profit and Loss Debtor for the Sum of Interest; and make the Man that lends it Creditor for the whole, both Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and Interest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose I lend Mony my self out at Interest, how must I book that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must Debtor the Borrower for the whole sum of Principal and Interest <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you must credit Cash for the Principal Mony that went out there; and you must credit Profit and Loss for the Interest Mony that is mentioned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:99634:112"/>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But if I receive Mony for Insurance, how must I book that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must debit Cash, because that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Mony; and you must credit Profit and Loss, because it is so much Mony gotten clear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What if I pay Mony for Insurance, what must I then do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then must you credit Cash, because the Mony goes out of it; and debit Profit and Loss, because it is so much that is as good as lost.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But supposing that my Ensurance be for another Man's Accompt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then debit him for the whole, and credit Cash for the Mony that was paid out to the Insurer, and credit Profit and loss for your Provision of the said Insurance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose I pay Mony upon Goods that go out of the Nation for Charges, as Custom and Packing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for my own Accompt, what must I do then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then you must make the Voyage to that place Debtor, in the hands of such a Man your Factor Debtor for the whole, and credit the Man that trusted you with the Goods, if you bought them at Time, (or Cash, if bought the Goods at ready Mony) and credit Cash for the Mony that goes out for Charges, and Profit and Loss for your Commission of the said Goods.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:99634:112"/>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose I lay out Mony for Charges upon Goods that come in from Sea.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Debtor the said Goods, whether for another Man's Accompt, or your own, and credit Cash for the Mony paid out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But if I lay out a sum of Mony for another Man's Accompt for Goods I ship for him, what must I do in that case?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must not make the Goods Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but the Man for whose Accompt the Goods were, must be made Debtor for the whole Sum, and Cash must be made Credit for the Mony that goes out in Charges.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>If I receive Mony for any Legacy that is left me, how must I book that same?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must debtor Cash, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Mony, and credit Profit and Loss, because it is so much profit to you; or you may credit Stock for the Mony, it comes all to one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose I have a Bill of Exchange that is remitted me at any time at double U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, or Usance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how must I book it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must debit Bills of Exchange remitted, (there being an Accompt so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) and credit the Man for the Mony he did remit: And the Reason is, The Remittor must be made Creditor: and it is a very great error in them that will say, the Remitter is not to be credited until the Mony is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for the Remitter must have credit as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99634:113"/>
soon as the Bill is accepted; but Cash cannot be made Debit, because it doth not receive any Mony into it until two months after: So that this Accompt is set up, and here is upon this a true sight of all the Bills you have standing out at any time, without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Bill-Book.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But what must I do then when that Bill is received in Mony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then must you Debit Cash, and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the Accompt before mentioned of Bills of Exchange remitted, because Cash hath the Mony, and this Accompt of Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change hath discharged its Trust.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose I have a Bill of Exchange that is remitted me at sight, and I receive Mony for it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then debit Cash, and credit the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What if a Man draw a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change upon me at time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then debit the Man, and credit the Accompt of Bills drawn, as you did an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of Bills remitted, because you must debit the Man, and you cannot credit Cash, because you do not pay it, but you may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Bills drawn; and when that Bill comes due, debit Bills drawn, and credit Cash for the Mony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>

               <p>Suppose I have sold Goods to a Man that is a Shopkeeper, and he comes for dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to have an abatement; how must I enter this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>There are several ways to enter this as it shall fall out; for the Goods may be of several sorts, some for your own Accompt, and some for other Mens Accompts; and sometimes the Accompts are shut up before, and sometimes an Accompt is sent to the Man the Goods belong'd unto.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>How must I do when I make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for dammage of the Goods that are for my own Accompt?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then Debit the Accompt of those Goods, and Credit the Man the Goods were sold unto.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But if the Goods were all sold, and I had put that Accompt on the Books, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Profit or Loss to its proper place, how is it then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then must you make Profit and Loss Debit, and Credit the Man that is to have the allowance made him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose it were for the Accompt of another Man, and he had had that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt sent him before.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then you must make that Man's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count current Debtor, &amp; Credit the Accompt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99634:114"/>
of the Man that is to have the allowance made him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But if I should have an allowance of any Man that had sold me Goods, how should I book that?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must make that Man Debtor, and the Accompt of Goods bought Credtor: or, if they are another Man's Accompt, then must you make that Man's Accompt Credit, by the former Man that did make the allowance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>If I buy Goods for my own Accompt of any Man, as Cloth, Lead, Stuffs, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how must I book that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must frame an Accompt for those Goods, Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and make them Debitor, and the Man you bought them of Creditor, specifying the Numbers, Length, Price, and what they come unto, with the Time they were bought for.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must then make the Goods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor to sundry Accompts, and those sundry Accompts must be the Men you bought them of, and this avoids making of several parcels in the Journal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But what if I buy any Goods for ready Mony, and that of one Man, or of more?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then Debit the Goods, and Credit Cash, because the Goods are in your pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,

               <p>But what if I should buy Goods for part Mony, and part Time?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then must you Debit those Goods that are bought, and Credit Cash for the Mony that went out, and credit the Man that did give you credit for the remainder.</p>

               <p>Suppose I sell a parcel of Feathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Time, to any Man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then Debit the Man that bought them, and Credit the Goods; because that Man that did buy them hath not yet paid for them, and the Goods they pass from you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But if I sell a parcel of Cheese for part Mony, and part Time, what must I do then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Debit the Man that bought them for so much as the Goods at Time comes unto, and Debit Cash for so much Mony as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and then Credit the Accompt of those Goods sold for the whole sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99634:115"/>
Another way is used by some Men, but nothing so well for the Buyer; and that is, To Debit the Buyer for the whole Sum the Goods come unto. And in another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, Debit Cash, and Credit the Buyer for the ready Mony. But this comes not nigh unto the other for dispatch and neatness, but is round the Bush, if the Mony be paid the same day.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But it may so fall out, that I may sell a parcel of Canvas for part Mony, part Time, and part Hollands, then what is to be done by me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Debit Cash for the Mony it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives into it; Debit the Buyer for what he doth buy at Time; and debtor Hollands for what they amount unto; and credit the Canvas for the whole sum of Monies.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But yet further, Sir, Suppose I sell a parcel of Wines, for part Mony, part a Bill, part in Logwood, and part at Time, what must I do then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then must you debit Cash for the Mony it receives; debit the Man the Bill or Bond is made by for the same, (reciting the Contents of it, and the Endorsers if any); debit Logwood for what that comes unto; and then debit the Buyer for what he buys, still saying, sundry Accompts are Debit; and credit your Accompt of Wines for the whole Sum that all these come unto.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But what if I send a parcel of Goods out for my own Accompt to any Factor at <hi>Hamborough, Cadiz,</hi> &amp;c. what must I do then?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then must you make Voyage to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> &amp;c. in the hands of such a Man my Factor, Debtor; and then make the Man, or Men that sell the Goods to you at Time, credit; and then make the Cash credit for any ready Mony that is laid out for Packing, Custom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>And when the Factor sells the Goods, what am I to do when he hath sent me an Account of the sales of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must debit the Factor my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, and credit that Voyage to <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and that you must do in a double Margent of two Species, one of the Coin of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> &amp;c. and the other of the place you live in: the inner Column must be the Column for the Outlandish Mony, that which is next your left hand in writing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must then make those Goods that come debit, and credit the Factor your Accompt, with a double Margent, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said of both Species.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>And what if that Factor should send me a parcel of Linnens for his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,

how must I Book that?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must make those Goods Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and specifie for whose Accompt they be, and credit Cash for the Monies laid out for the Charges upon them paid by you at their landing.</p>

               <p>The selling of Goods for your own Accompt, or that of any Friend of yours, is all one; the Buyer must be made Debtor, and the Goods always (naming for whose Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt they are) are to be made credit but in this present case.</p>

               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; there are several Niceties and Rarities in Book-keeping, but to tell you of them, would be but to burden your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the practical and sensitive part is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired before you can be perfectly able to do a thing as it should: But here is a general
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99634:117"/>
Rule to be observed by you in entring every Parcel; and if you do mind it, you can never be out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, let me know what that is, and I will endeavour to remember it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Every Parcel consists, and is made up of four several things, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray explain this unto me by some Example that I may know it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>That I shall by this Example: You have paid <hi>l.</hi> 100: 0: 0 <hi>d.</hi> for the Accompt of <hi>James Webster</hi> of <hi>Darby,</hi> and in your Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it is written thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>London,</hi> 25 <hi>May,</hi> 1677.</p>
               <p>— <hi>James Webster</hi> of <hi>Darby,</hi> Debtor to Cash <hi>l.</hi> 100, for so much paid for him to <hi>Tho. W.</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as by his Order, the <hi>24th</hi> Instant, is<hi>—l.</hi> 100: 0: 0</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:99634:117"/>
Here you may observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>J. W.</hi> is the Debtor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Cash is the Creditor.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>l.</hi> 100: 0: 0 <hi>d.</hi> is the Sum.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Reason of the Parcel; it was for Mony paid to <hi>T. W.</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> by his Order, of the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1677.</p>
               <p>And carrying this in your mind, you will find an admirable advantage; for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are entring a Parcel, and cannot remember it, this will bring each part to your perfect memory, because it is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-wall upon which all is built of each Parcel.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I begin with the first Column, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1. That is for the Month; therein you only set the name of the Month.</p>
               <p>In the Column, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2. you only put the Day of the Month in figures always.</p>
               <p>In the third Colum, you put the Matter of the Parcel, be it of the Debit side, or of the Credit side of each Parcel, as you see in this last Parcel of <hi>James Webster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth Column, you see the figure of the Accompt you post unto; and if you turn to that figure, you will find out where that Accompt stands, and the particulars.</p>

               <p>In posting this, observe these following Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seek at the beginning of your <hi>Ledger</hi> for your Alphabet, what Folio the said <hi>James Websters</hi> Accompt standeth in: Suppose it stands in Folio 17; turn to that Folio, and there proceed thus; in the first Column put down <hi>May,</hi> in the second Column put down the 26: in the third Column put down the Party to whom he is Debit to Cash, with as much as you can of the Reason of the Parcel in one Line; but be sure never make two Lines in the posting of any parcel in the <hi>Ledger</hi> upon any Accompt whatsoever: and in the fourth Column put the Folio where Cash stands, and that is Folio 19; and then set the Sum of Mony <hi>l.</hi> 100: 0: 0: and so the Parcel is posted: And when you have posted it in this manner, then return to your <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:99634:120"/>
and there you will find such a small stroke at the beginning of it as this is—; there you must put this mark of the Folio where <hi>James Webster</hi>'s Accompt stands, which is Folio 17, and then that stroke will stand thus 17; then have you done that part which is the Debit part of your Parcel, and that is just the one half. Then must you go unto the Credit of the Parcel, thus: You may turn to Folio 19, that is Cash; and there you must name in the first Column <hi>May;</hi> in the second, 26; in the third, by <hi>James Webster;</hi> in the fourth, the Folio <hi>James Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>'s Accompt doth stand in; and then the Sum of Mony, which is <hi>l.</hi> 100: 0: 0 <hi>d.</hi> and so you return to the <hi>Journal,</hi> and there you find the posting Line to stand thus 17; and now under this you must put this Folio of Cash, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 19, and then it will shew thus 17/19, and so your Parcel is quite done both for Debtor and Creditor; and where-ever you meet with a Parcel that hath but one side of this Posting-line supplied with Figures, then there is one side unposted.</p>

               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I do not well understand what it is to look into this Alphabet; pray tell me what an Alphabet means.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>An Alphabet is a Book of 24 Leaves; sometimes 12 leaves, or 24, left at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Ledger,</hi> and therein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99634:120"/>
the 24 Letters of your Alphabet, from whence it derives its name; if 24 leaves, there's 1 Letter for each Leaf; but if but 12 Leaves, then is there 2 Letters for each Leaf.</p>

               <p>When the form is thus made, who must set his hand to it, the Merchant or the Master of a Ship? and where must it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>As I said before, it is in the same nature as the Lease of a House, and each Party hath one, it being an Indenture, the Merchant signs one to the Master, and the Master one to the Merchant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you by an <hi>Indenture?</hi> I know what that means that is often na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med betwixt Masters and Servants, but I know not how you can bring it in here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning of an <hi>Indenture</hi> is; When two Writings are drawn upon any Accompt whatsoever, word for word alike, and that one Man Signs, Seals, and Delivers one, and another Man Signs the other; and the reason they are called <hi>Indentures</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Skin of Parchment, or a sheet of Paper is taken and cut through the middle in this manner;</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>So that after they are cut, if you come to join them together again, you will presently see if they do agree or no; for if one of them be counterseited, they will not exactly join together again; and this is the meaning of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99634:127"/>
an <hi>Indenture;</hi> and each Person keeps one of them by him, that so at any time he may have recourse unto it, and see the Covenants he is to perform, or what is by others to be performed to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Having thus far satisfied me, pray let me next know what is meant by a thing I have often heard spoke of, and that is <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,</hi> and making of an <hi>Award.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arbitration</hi> is a thing much used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Merchants and Traders of all sorts, and is used when there is any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Man and Man, rather than to suffer the Parties to go to Law, and there to spend their Mony, and Time, (which things are both equal to a Trader): for a Trader's Thoughts ought to be possessed of the best Seasons for buying Goods, the Nature and Qualities of the Goods he buys, the Times and Places that are best for selling his Goods, the Usages and Customs, with the Monies and Exchanges of the Nations he trades unto, and not to spend his time in frivolous Disputes and Quarrels; if he doth, he may be more fitly called a Sollicitor than a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant: And therefore Men of repute, and them that are good Husbands of their Time and Mony, will be willing to refer any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that shall happen unto them, unto Merchants or Tradesmen that understand their Disputes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:99634:127"/>
And therefore to make you the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what Arbitration is, let me know from you what difference you would be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied about.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>The other day, Sir, my Master sold 40 Butts of Currants to four Grocers in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and I weighed them, and delivered them, and agreed in the Number of Draughts, as you formerly did direct me in <hi>Page</hi> 16, and then made a Bill of Parcels, as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in <hi>Page</hi> 19, and had them all sent in; and now I go for the Mony, they will not pay; they say they must have considerable allowance for Dammage that they find in the said Goods, and for false Tares; and my Master may take his course at Law for his Mony if he will, for they will not pay the Mony: My Master, he says, he doth not care for going to Law, he had rather put it to <hi>Arbitration.</hi> Now here I am at a loss, Sir, I know not what this <hi>Arbitration</hi> is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>If he doth go to <hi>Arbitration,</hi> then doth he chuse one Arbitrator, and the Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers chuse another; and these Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are to reconcile all manner of difference betwixt your Master and them by such a day: If these two Arbitrators cannot do it, then they are to chuse an Umpire that shall do it in so many days after the time that was before limited.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The first thing that is done, is a Bond, known by the Name of an <hi>Arbitration Bond,</hi> which is Signed, Sealed, and Delivered, by each Person in difference, whereby they do in such a certain Sum of Mony, oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to rest by, stand to, and perform all that shall be ordered by <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>D. C.</hi> the Arbitrators.</p>

               <p>Before you proceed any further, pray Sir let me see what one of these Arbitration Bonds is, and how it is made, and then I shall the better be able to understand what I desire from you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The first thing they do, is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Matter by Writtings, Letters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be Matter of Accompts; if it be any other Quarrels or Differences, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the several Witnesses; and in Matter of Goods, then to examine the Goods (if they are in being) and so cause either the Complainant to abate of his Demands, or the other to allow: In short, to fix a certain Sum for one or the other to pay; or in some cases to sign General Releases each to the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But what if these two Men cannot agree, what must then be done in such a case?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must then have a third Person chosen, which Person is called an <hi>Umpire,</hi> and he is to examine what the other two Persons have done, and then the whole Matter is left in his Breast, and he is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the difference that yet remains; and his single determination being given in, under Hand and Seal by such a day, (provided the Arbitration Bonds do specifie that there shall be an Umpire, for in many cases it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon) does the work alone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, let me know what kind of thing that <hi>Award</hi> is which you spake of.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:99634:130"/>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Award</hi> is a certain Writing that is signed by the Arbitrators, wherein is recited the Bond the two Parties at difference en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into; and then it doth recite how they have called all Persons before them; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a due consideration of all Matters, such and such things are ordered by them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>And must the Persons in difference fulfil what these Men order and decree them to do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; or else he that stands out, doth forfeit the Bond he did enter into.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But if I am at any difference with a Man for a thing that is but small, what is it I must then do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Then you have nothing else to do, but to refer it before Witness, or change a piece of Mony, (as some do); but that Sentence, or Award, must be past presently, or in two or three days, else it will be void in Law.</p>

               <p>You having instructed me in these things, which I find much benefit by, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to explain a little fuller to me the Mystery of reducing the Monies of one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into that of another, in which thing I am as yet ignorant, you having shewed me but one Instance, and that is of our <hi>English</hi> Mony into <hi>French,</hi> in <hi>Page</hi> 89; I would fain request you to give me some further light into the said Mystery of Calculating Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes.</p>

               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:99634:130"/>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>Propound then your Question, and I will answer it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>I have a Bill of 423 Crowns of <hi>French</hi> Mony given me to reduce into <hi>English</hi> Mony, at 55 <hi>d.</hi> ⅜ <hi>per</hi> Crown; but I know not how to reduce it, having never seen it done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The manner of doing it is thus:</p>
            </sp>
            <p n="1">1. Set down the number of Crowns 423.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Set down under them the price, that is 55 <hi>d.</hi> ⅜.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Multiply the Crowns by the Pence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider what part of a Peny your ⅜ is <hi>viz.</hi> a Farthing is ¼, ⅛ is half the Farthing.</p>
            <p>Take these out of the Crowns; and then when you have done so, add up all together, and you shall find so many Pence; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by 12, and by 20, and your Sum the 423 Crowns amounts unto is <hi>l. 97:</hi> 11: 11½.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example.</hi> 
               <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap> And thus you see what it comes unto.</p>
            <sp>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:99634:131"/>
               <speaker>Yo.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, suppose I have a parcel of Dollars out of the Low Countries, or pieces of Eight out of <hi>Spain,</hi> or Duckets in <hi>Italy,</hi> or Mill-Rays in <hi>Portugal,</hi> Flemish Pounds in <hi>Holland,</hi> Guilders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all these are different things, and you give me no light to this; how shall I know the way to cast up any of these Coins so different?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>The chief thing you are to enquire into in order unto this, is to understand what Species the two places do exchange in: As for Example; <hi>France</hi> keeps Accompts in Livers, Solz, and Deniers, but yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes with all Nations in Crowns. <hi>Holland</hi> keeps Accompts in Guilders, Stivers, and Penninges, and yet exchanges with <hi>England</hi> in pounds <hi>Flemish;</hi> and so of other Nations before named. Now your great work is, to be exact in bringing the Coin the Nation trades in, into the Coin it exchanges in; for when the other is brought into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing Coin, it is no more than to cast up any ordinary Commodity: for although it makes a great noise of 1000 Duca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons, at <hi>65d.</hi> ⅜: 1470 Crowns, at <hi>54d.</hi> ½: <hi>l.</hi> 237: 10: 0 <hi>Flemish,</hi> at 34 <hi>s. 9 d. &amp;c.</hi> it is no more than if a Man should say, 1000 Ells of Silk, at 5 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> ⅜ <hi>per</hi> Ell. 1470 Ells of Cloth, at 4 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> ½ <hi>per</hi> Ell. 237 <abbr>lb</abbr> ½ of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, at 34 <hi>s. 9 d. per</hi> 
                  <abbr>lb</abbr>. This every School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy can do: But the chief matter is this,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99634:131"/>
whereof I will now shew you an Example or two, and all the rest are the same, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man lives at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and writes me word he hath sold some Goods for me; the Nete proceed of which is <hi>l.</hi> 4276: 17: <hi>6 d. French-</hi>Mony, and he will remit me the same Mony at 54 <hi>d.</hi> ½ <hi>per</hi> Crown; how shall I know whether I am cheated or no? I know how to cast it up very well if it be so many Crowns at 54 <hi>d.</hi> ½, but I know not how to bring these <hi>l.</hi> 4276: 17: <hi>6 d.</hi> into Crowns.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr.</speaker>
               <p>You must enquire how many <hi>French</hi> Pounds make a Crown, and you will find three: Divide the 4276: 17: <hi>6 d.</hi> by three, thus;
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>And there remains one pound in the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that is, 20 Solz; and the 17 Solz <hi>6</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers being added, makes 37 Solz <hi>6</hi> Deniers: So that the answer you will have, is, you will find just 1425 Crowns 37 <hi>s. 6</hi> Deniers. Now if you cannot tell how many Livers, Solz, and Deniers makes the Coin you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in, how can you tell what it is that you are to have in Crowns? for he may as well make you good but 1214 Crowns, as your due 1425, and you never the wiser.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:99634:132"/>
The same may be done also for <hi>Spanish-</hi>Mony; your Factor at <hi>Cadiz</hi> writes you word, he hath sold as many Goods for you as come to 8756 Ryals Plate. Now you accompt in Ryals Plate, but you exchange in Pieces of Eight; and it behoves you to know how many Ryals Plate makes a Piece of Eight; there is 8; divide 8756 by 8, and it is,
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Now these 1094 pieces of Eight ½, at 47 <hi>d.</hi> ¾, is no other than 1094 ½ Ells of <hi>Holland,</hi> at 3 <hi>s.</hi> 11 <hi>d.</hi> ¾ <hi>per</hi> Ell: And this may serve you as a general Rule for all Exchanges; and the daily practice you will meet with, will give you better satisfaction than any thing else can do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:99634:132"/>
                  <hi>Certain Directions how to examine your Books, if they do not ballance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Examine your <hi>Journal</hi> against your <hi>Waste-Book,</hi> to see if that agrees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Examine the <hi>Journal,</hi> and see if the additions of the inside Column be right, and that they amount to the Sum in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prick over your <hi>Ledger</hi> against your <hi>Journal,</hi> to see if each Parcel be truly posted into the said <hi>Ledger</hi> out of the <hi>Journal.</hi> Put at the end of each Line in the <hi>Ledger,</hi> this mark. or — which you like best, with a Red-lead or Black-lead Pencil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Examine your Ballance-sheet, if the Credit be not put for the Debit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Re-examine each Folio in the <hi>Ledger,</hi> to see if there be no Errors in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ballances, and in those <hi>Additions</hi> and <hi>Substractions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Re-examine each Accompt, although it stands ballanced on the <hi>Ledger,</hi> to see if it be true, for many times a fault escapes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Examine the examining-marks in the <hi>Ledger</hi> before mentioned, to see if there be not some Parcel wants a mark, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it.</p>
               <p>And I will confidently affirm to any Man,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99634:133"/>
that when you have with diligence sought these several ways, you will find it out: for if 2 times 3 be 6, or 6 times 3 be 18; so true is it your Books will come out even in the Ballance-Sheet; for all that is in Books, is but dividing an entire Sum into many parts, which must all come to the same end at last.</p>
