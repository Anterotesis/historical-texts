         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Which be vnlyke things? ſuch as be indued with diuers qualities, as a man, and a Lion, a Lion &amp; an Egle, an Egle and a Babian: theſe be one vnlyke to another.</p>

Let him conſyder, what it is to meaſure the hugenes of the mountaynes, the courſes of the waters, the ſpaces of the feyldes, the heyght of heauen, the depth of the ſea.

But thou ſhalte doe better to eſpye that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is miniſtred vnto thée, to prayſe GOD in that thou canſt not do it. To thoſe that conſyder of the number of the creatures, we haue giuen a kind of taſt. Nowe will we go about to ſet forth the beautie of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Although the beautie of the creatures reſteth in many and diuers pointes, yet there be ſome chiefely, in the which all the beautie of the ſame doeth ſtande. Sight, mouing, ſhape, and quality. The which if a man were able fully to ſearch out, he ſhould fynde with all them, the meruaylous light of God his wiſdome. And woulde God, I coulde as plainely ſpie them, and as fully ſet them downe, as I doe earneſtlie loue them, for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
<pb facs="tcp:14611:12"/>
me greatly, bicauſe it is excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſweete and pleaſant, often to deale about thoſe things: for both the ſence is taught by reaſon, and the minde deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſwéetenes, and the affection ſtirred vp with further deſire, inſomuch that amazed and meruayling, we crye oute with good King Dauid: How mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous are thy workes, O Lorde, in thy wiſdome haſt thou made all things, thou haſt delyghted me with thy handye workes of thy hands, and in the works of thy handes wyll I reioyce. An vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe man doth not knowe this, and a foole doth not conſider of it.</p>
               <p>For the whole world which is knowne by ſence, is as it were a booke written with the fynger of God: That is to ſay, made by the power of God: And euery y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> creatures be, as it were certaine letters founde out not by the ſkill of man, but ordeyned by the iudgement of God, to make knowne, and as it were after a certaine maner to ſignify the inuyſible wiſdome of God. And as an vnlearned man ſée a booke open, he looketh vpon the letters, but knoweth not what they
<pb facs="tcp:14611:13"/>
meane: So a fooliſhe man and carnall, doth not vnderſtande the things that be of God, but in theſe ſéene creatures, he beholdeth the outwarde ſhape, but doth not perceyue the wiſedome of God in them. But he that is of the ſpirite, and can giue true iudgement of all things, in that, that is outward doth beholde the beautie of the worke, and inwardlye ſpyeth how marueylouſly the wiſedome of the maker is. And therefore there is none but he meruayleth at GOD hys works. For the fooliſh and vnwiſe man doth wonder at only the outward ſhape: but the wiſe man by that which he ſéeth outwardlye, doeth picke out the déepe knowledge of God his wiſedome, as if in one and the ſelfe ſame wryting, one man praiſe the colour and proportion of the letters, and an other the ſence and meaning.</p>
               <p>Therfore it is very good continually, to beholde and looke vppon the workes of God, but ſo him which cannot tourne the beautie of bodily thinges to an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye vſe, for therefore the worde of God doth ſo often moue vs to think vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:14611:13"/>
the wonderfull workes of God, that by the outward things which we ſée, we may come to the knowledge of inward truth. Wherevpon King Dauid doeth tell it often, as a great matter, that he hath ſo done, and promyſeth ſtyll ſo to doe, ſaying: I haue remembered thy dayes of olde, and haue muſed vpon the workes of thy handes, and will be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in thy wiſedomes. Herevpon alſo the Prophete Eſay doth ſay to certayne, which not knowing their Creator, doe giue vnto the creatures the honor due to God. Who hath meaſured the waters in his fyſt, and compaſſed the Heauens with his ſpanne? and comprehended the duſt of the earth with his fyngers? or hath weyghed the Mountaynes in hys ſkayles, and the hilles in ballances? He that ſitteth vpon the circle of the earth, and before whom the inhabitants ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be as Graſhoppers, he that ſtretcheth out the heauens as a Curtaine, &amp; ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out as a Tent to dwell in. And agayne, King Dauid ſayeth in another place, reproouing the worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages: All the Gods of the gentyls be
<pb facs="tcp:14611:14"/>
Deuils, but the Lorde hath made the heauens.</p>
               <p>Why then doe you thinke, that the workes of God be ſo plainly aduouched to maintaine the true goohead, and that it is ſaide, the Lorde made the heauens: but bicauſe the creature well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, doth teach a man to know his Creator.</p>
               <p>Let vs alſo therfore note the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes of God, &amp; by the bewtyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the things made, let vs ſeeke out that bewtiful, moſt bewtiful of al bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull things, which is ſo merueylous, &amp; vnſpeakable, that al bewty in reſpect of it is nothing.

               <p>Truely, as man doth deſyre to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, ſo he cannot do great things, for ſo much the leſſe he doth preuayle or proſper in euery one, as the thinges be more in number, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which he doth imploy the force of his indeuour.</p>
               <p>Agayne when he coueteth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he is hindered by the number, for he is not able to beſtow ſtrength vppon many, which he hath ſpente vpon one.

We fynd by common experyence, that the Scriuener doth more readily write little letters, and is more payned with the greater, and the faſter the Pen run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the worſe the letters be, that be written.</p>
               <p>Alſo in making of Garmentes, ſuch as ſéeke to haue them to fine, often looſe the profyte, and they that ſéeke profite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> often want hanſomneſſe.</p>

               <p>THE graces in God not ſéene, I ſayd were Power, Wyſdome, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

And the ſéene things be called the Images of the not ſéene, as the number of creatures, is the Image of the not ſéene power: The bewty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures is the Image of the not ſeene Wiſdom: The profytableneſſe of the creatures is the Image of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not ſéene mercy. And euery creature y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nearer it commeth to the likenes of the creator, ſo much more
<pb facs="tcp:14611:28"/>
plainly doth it reſemble and expreſſe the creator.</p>
               <p>So that, the ſéene Image ought fyrſt to ſhew the not ſeene patterne, which holdeth in himſelfe, the Image of the Godhead more liuely ſet out.</p>
               <p>The number of the creatures doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſe the ſubſtaunce or matter. The bewty of the creatures doth rather expreſſe the fourme and the ſubſtaunce, or matter immagined without form, is formeles. And that that is formleſſe in reſpect of the ſubſtaunce, is like vnto God. But that, that hath forme is more like vnto God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth forme.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon it is playne, that the bewty of creatures, which reſembleth fourme is a more euidente Image, then theſe the number of creatures, which reſembleth ſubſtaunce.</p>
               <p>Alſo the bewty of creatures, through the naturall forme, belongeth to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, the profitableneſſe to the action, for in that his creatures be profytable, that they be lyable to the vſe and commodity of man.</p>
               <p>But that, that belongeth to the habite
<pb facs="tcp:14611:29"/>
is more proper, that is more certayne, then that that belongeth to the action. Becauſe nature hath ingraffed the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, but excercyſe hath bred the action. Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Image of bewty doth excell in knowledge both the number, and the profytablenes. And therfore as fyrſt in knowledge, becauſe it is more euydent in repreſentation, or reſemblaunce.</p>
               <p>Fyrſt therfore in this Image, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of contemplation is to be layd, that when we haue layd the foundation of ſearching thorow the direction ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we may more ſtrongly, and readily buyld the reſt of the worke.</p>
               <p>And now in ſearching out wiſedome, the beginning of the ſearching is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well taken from the very Image of wiſedome, becauſe the father is made manifeſt thorow his wiſedome, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he ſent his wiſedome to take fleſh vpon him, but then alſo, when by his wiſedome he made the world.</p>
               <p>The bewty of creatures, which we haue eftſoones ſayd to be the Image of God, his wiſdome, doth conſiſt in foure thinges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14611:29"/>Sight, Moouing, Shape, and Quality. But in theſe foure thinges, it is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Moouing hath the prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for that, things that can mooue, are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto life, then thinges that cannot mooue.</p>
               <p>Moouing is of foure ſorts, Place, Life, Nature, and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But moouing of Nature, is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moouing of place, becauſe that in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of nature, not only y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Image of life is expreſſed, but lyfe it ſelfe after a ſorte is begone.</p>
               <p>Agayne mouing of lyfs, doth ſo farre out goe mouing of nature, as that, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foele, doth paſſe that that cannot féele.</p>
               <p>Laſt of al, mouing of reaſon doth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all, becauſe in that, not only the ſences be moued to quicken, and geue life, but alſo reaſon to vnderſtand. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all creatures, there is no Image more euident then this, becauſe that, which ſauoureth of wiſdome, doth moſt playnly ſhewe the not ſéene wiſedome. Therefore the fyrſt &amp; principall Image of wiſdome unmade, is wiſedom made, that is the creature indewed with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:14611:30"/>
which becauſe it is in ſome reſpecte ſéene, and in ſome reſpect not ſéene, it is both the gate of contemplation, and the way.</p>
               <p>The gate in that, that it is ſeeue, the way in that, that it is not ſéene.</p>
               <p>The Gate becauſe it doth ſhewe the entry to the mind, that entreth into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
               <p>The waye, becauſe it bringeth tho minde running in contemplation to the ende.</p>
               <p>The Gate, becauſe after a ſorte, it doth ſhew thinges inuiſible; viſibly.</p>
               <p>The way, becauſe it doth bring man going by the viſible to the inuiſible, to ſee the maker of both viſible; a inuiſible.</p>
               <p>This man may ſée in himſelfe. For fyrſt none can be reckned to haue any witte, that doth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſée that he is, and yet if a man will wrigh with himſelfe, that that he is, he ſhal fynd that he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the thinges, which eyther bée ſéene, or can be ſéene in hym. For that which in vs is partaker of reaſon, and as I might ſay poured into vs and mixed with the fleſh, doth yet of it ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer
<pb facs="tcp:14611:30"/>
the ſelfe from the ſubſtance of the fleſh, &amp; iudge the ſelfe to be diuers from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore a Gate of contemplation is opened to man, when he beginneth to enter to know himſelfe by direction of his own reaſon. And when he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the way, to run to the end, doeth remayne that euery one may come by the knowledge of his maker.</p>
               <p>For that in vs, which hath not the ſubſtaunce of fleſh, hath no matter from the fleſh, but as it is parted from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fleſh. And yet it doeth moſt certeinly knowe, that it hath a beginning in that that it doth know that it is, and doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it hath bene euer, where as the knowing vnderſtanding cannot be certayne.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the vnderſtanding can not be, except it doth vnderſtand, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that thoſe thinges, which we knowe, haue not euer vnderſtoode, we ſhould belee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> haue not euer bene, that
<pb facs="tcp:14611:31"/>
is to ſay, at ſometimes haue had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>But eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I ſayd before, that which hath a ſpirituall ſubſtance, cannot haue a bodily beginning. For whatſoeuer is brought from the former matter, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued to be bodily. Therefore if that which is not ſéene in vs haue a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it muſt néedes fal out, that it was not made of a former matter, but of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>And that which is nothing, cannot geue ſubſtaunce to the ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whatſoeuer hath had a beginning, certaynly hath receiued ſubſtance from another. And that which is not of it ſelf, cannot geue being to an other: And therefore whoſoeuer he is, that hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen being to other thinges, hath not receiued his being of an other thing. Which may be euidently proued thus, if that we beléeue that euery thing that is, is a creature, there will neuer be end founde.</p>
               <p>Therefore our nature doth teach vs, that our Maker is euerlaſting, which hath hys owne and proper: that is to
<pb facs="tcp:14611:31"/>
ſay, he is of himſelf. For if he had taken his being from an other thing, he coulde not be called truely the firſt originall of things: For if at any time he were not, he had not beginning of himſelfe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be called firſt, if he toke his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an other. Therefore if he be the fyrſt maker, he was euer.</p>
               <p>Alſo that, which is of the leſſe, muſte néeds be. For whoſoeuer is of the ſelfe, to that it is one thing to be, &amp; that that it is. This is playne, bycauſe nothing can be parted or ſeuered from the ſelfe: That therefore, to the which it is the ſame, the being, and that that it is, muſt néedes be euer, becauſe nothing can be ſeuered from the ſelfe. If therfore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer be of the ſelfe, to the ſame the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that that it is be all one, he that hath not receaued his being from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt conſequently of neceſſitie be euer. Neither can be taken away from another, that was not giuen of another.</p>
               <p>So that it muſt néeds follow, that the thinges, which we beleue the maker to be, that we confeſſe the ſame, can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue beginning or ending: for that
<pb facs="tcp:14611:32"/>
hath no beginning which was euer, and that hath no ending, which endeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Then neyther is there eternall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the maker, neyther can the maker be but eternall.</p>
               <p>This knowledge haue we founde in the mouing of reaſon, which we haue according to the eternall maker, which lacketh beginning, becauſe it was euer. The other mouings doe confyrme this knowledge, I mean the mouing of life, nature, and place. For in the mouing of lyfe, be féeling and deſyre, and eche na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall deſyre may be ſatiſfyed, neyther is there any ordinary deſyre, but it may compaſſe the deſyre. For example ſake: Lyuing thinges hunger, and they finde thinges which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lake their hunger, they thirſt, and finde things which quenche their thirſte, they be colde, and fynde things to warme them. Therefore thys is plaine, that the prouidence of God is gon before, by whoſe aduiſe this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créede, that no neceſſary reliefe ſhoulde be wanting.</p>
               <p>For he that made the deſyre, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared nouriſhment for the deſyres, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:14611:32"/>
coulde it in any wiſe be, if thinges went by chaunce, that the coutentations ſhould ſo iuſtly &amp; fully ſatiſfy the deſires</p>
               <p>The mouing of nature proueth the ſame, for as it is vnpoſſible, that anye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing by the ſelfe ſhould be made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo is it altogether vnpoſſible, that any thing ſhould take increaſe of the ſelfe, I meane y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, that, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not giue it ſelf beginning, cannot giue it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, for whatſoeuer doth increaſe a thing growing, muſt néedes be an other from that, which by it ſelfe before onely was without increaſe. Then if nothing can grow, except there be put to it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which it had not before, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that nothing growing taketh increaſe of it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therfore he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth increaſe of thinges growing, gaue the increaſe of things being.</p>
               <p>The mouing of place doth proue thys alſo, for we ſée, that certaine creatures moue continually, and ſome by tymes, &amp; ſome after one ſort, &amp; ſome after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And although thinges moue in ſo dyuers maners, yet the order of thinge is neuer broken. Wherevpon it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb facs="tcp:14611:33"/>
that there is inwardly ſome direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gouernour, which doth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate all the things by a certaine law.</p>
               <p>Howe then can we denye the prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? if that euerie natural deſyre find foode prepared for it naturally. Neither falleth it out, at any time, that nature deſireth that in one thing, but it maye haue it in an other.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe ſythe that mouing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, grow outwardly by ſundry and diuers wayes, doe neuer yet breake the generall order, howe can we denie that there is in them ſome direction: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be doubted, but the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Gouernor doth rule within, which both by his prouidence doeth foreſee the ſequels of all thinges, and by his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth order the ſame.</p>

               <p>But bicauſe one is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers waies, it is to be declared, how the maker of all things is one.</p>
               <p>There is one by gathering together, and one by compounding, and one by likeneſſe, and one by ſubſtance, and one by identitie or ſameneſſe.</p>

               <p>It is not tollerable, that we ſhoulde thinke the maker of thinges to be one, eyther by gathering together of diuers, or compounding of partes, or likeneſſe

               <p>Ech thing is chaunged in Place, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place to another, that is to ſay, when it leaueth to be in the place, in the which it was, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be in the place, in the which it was not. And this chaunging is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and doth not alter any whit of the
<pb facs="tcp:14611:35"/>
ſubſtaunce, or being of the thing. For although it leaue to be where it was, it leaueth not to be that which it was. And although it beginne to be where it was not, yet it doeth not begin to be that which it was not.</p>
               <p>In forme ech thing is chaunged, when as a thing continueth in the ſame place according to the ſubſtaunce, and yet ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the increaſe getteth ſome thing, which it had not before, or to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decreaſe looſeth ſomething, which it had before, or elſe according to the altering begynneth to haue ſomething, that it had before, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then it had it before.</p>
               <p>I wyll not ſpeake of chaunging in tyme, becauſe that is bredde of the two firſt. For nothing can be chaunged in tyme, but it muſt be chaunged eyther in forme or place. If therefore it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that God can be changed neither in forme nor place. Then it wil be moſt certaine, that GOD is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable.</p>
               <p>We ſhal eaſily proue, that God is not chaunged, according to the chaunging of place, if we proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is euery where.
<pb facs="tcp:14611:35"/>
For that which is euery where, is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place. And that which is in euerye place, cannot go from place to place. There be many profes that God is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where: And fyrſt our owne ſoule, the which both reaſon doth playnely fynde, that it is a ſymple ſubſtaunce, and ſence doth proue, that it is diſpearſed through all that which doeth quicken the bodye. For whatſoeuer parte of the quick body is hurte, it is one ſpirite, to the which feeling of ech payne is caryed, the which coulde not be, if the one and the ſame ſpirite where not diſpearſed thorow the whole.</p>
               <p>If therefore the reaſonable ſpirite of man being ſymple, is diſpearſed thorow the whole bodye which it guydeth, it is not conuenient, that that creating ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which guydeth and poſſeſſetth all things, ſhoulde be tyed, and bounde to ſome one place, but rather ſhoulde be thought to fyll all places.</p>
               <p>For the very mouinges of all thinges which doe run euery where, with ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and reaſonable moderation doth ſhew life quick within. Yet may not we
<pb facs="tcp:14611:36"/>
in any caſe beléeue, that as the ſpirite of man is perſonally ioyned to the body, which it quickneth, that ſo ech creating ſpirite to be coupled perſonaly to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this ſenſible world. For God fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the world one way, and the ſoule the body an other.</p>
               <p>The ſoule fylleth the body &amp; is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, bicauſe it maye be compaſſed about.</p>
               <p>God fylleth the world, but is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, becauſe being preſente euerye where, he cannot beholden any where.</p>

               <p>FUrthermore, ſythence we ſée the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of God his power to be wanting no where, why ſhoulde we not thinke, that the ſame power of GOD is in all thinges. And if Gods power be euerye where, and if alſo God his power, and God be all one, it is moſt playne that God is euery where, for God doeth not néede any others ayde to doe any thing, as a manne doeth, for man often tymes doth that by the helpe of another, which he cannot do by his own power. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb facs="tcp:14611:36"/>
after a certaine maner of ſpéeche, man is oftentimes ſaide to doe a thing, in that place, where it is manifeſt, that he is abſent bodily.</p>
               <p>As the king oftentimes making hys aboade in his owne citie is reported, to fyght in another place with his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to ouercome, or be ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: bicauſe the kings ſouldiours vpon his pleaſure or commaundement, doe fight, &amp; do ouercome, or be ouercommed.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, when a man hitteth with his ſtaffe, or with a ſtone, a thing farre from him, the man is ſayd to hit that, which his ſtaffe or ſtone did hit. There be many of this ſorte, but none of theſe be ſpoken properly: becauſe, that which the one doth is aſcribed to the other.</p>
               <p>But God which thorow his own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by his own ſelfe doeth all thinges, whereſoeuer he is preſente in worke, muſt néedes be there alſo preſente in Godhead.</p>
               <p>Now if any man would aſke, howe God being a ſymple ſubſtaunce, can be euery where? He is to vnderſtand that the ſpirite is called ſymple one waye,
<pb facs="tcp:14611:37"/>
and the body ſimple another way.</p>
               <p>For the body is called ſimple for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, but the ſpirite is called ſimple, not for the littleneſſe, but in reſpecte of the vnity or oneneſſe. Therfore the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker both is ſimple becauſe he is one, and euery where, becauſe he is God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in euery place, can be holden of no place, for fylling all thinges, he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me, and is not conteyned. Therefore becauſe he is in euery place, he cannot be moued from place to place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is holden in no place, he is not locall.</p>
               <p>But the chaunging that is according to forme, is eyther mereſed, or decieſed, or altered. But none of theſe canne be found in the nature of God, which the ſeuerall diſcourſe of each will make playne.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer groweth or increaſeth, taketh ſome thing beſides it ſelfe. And whatſoeuer taketh any thing more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is in it ſelfe, muſt néedes take it from another. For nothing can geue to it ſelfe that which it hath not.</p>
               <p>And of whome can the maker of all
<pb facs="tcp:14611:37"/>
thinges take any thing that it hath not, ſeeing that euery thing that is, commeth from him. Then he cannot increaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot take any thing more then himſelfe. Neyther can he decreaſe or be dominiſhed. For whatſoeuer can be made leſſe then it ſelfe, is not truely one. For that which deuideth it ſelfe in ſeuering, was neuer the ſame in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miction.</p>
               <p>Therefore God to whome it is all one to be that which he is, can by no meanes be made leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe. Neyther there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfectneſſe of God can be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor the vnity deminiſhed, nor the immenſity comprehended, nor he, that is preſent in euery place, can be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from place to place.</p>
               <p>Now I am to teach, how God cannot be altered, and becauſe the altering of bodyes is one, &amp; the altering of ſpirites another, and becauſe alſo it is playne by that, which is ſayd before, that God is no body, but a ſpirite, ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> we intreat of God, it is néedeleſſe to ſpeake much of the alteration of bodies, and yet I will much the ſame briefely, becauſe I may
<pb facs="tcp:14611:38"/>
more commodiouſly come to the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirites.</p>
               <p>The alteration of the bodies doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the compounding of the parts, and mutuall chaunge of the qualities. The alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſpirite is by knowledge and affection.</p>
               <p>The ſpirits be chaunged according to affection, in becomming ſomtimes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſometimes ſad, according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to be ſometimes more, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſe wiſe.</p>
               <p>There be two thinges chiefely, which alter the affection of the worker, eyther if he hath done any thing heretofore to be repented of, or doe appoynt to do any thing hereafter out of order. But that God doth nothing to repent of, doth this vnchaungeable courſe of thinges plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue, which do ſo kéepe by a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law, the order of their fyrſt appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that God doth purpoſe or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to doe nothing out of order. Doeth the reaſonable ſequell proue, which in the whole body of nature doeth in no poynt diſagrée vnto it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Therefore God his will is vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb facs="tcp:14611:38"/>
becauſe he doth neuer chaunge ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his councell of that, which is paſt, or his purpoſe of that which is to come &amp; ſo we ought to beleeue that God is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable in knowledge.</p>

once vnder one beame of ſight, I ſay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe it comprehendeth eche ſubſtaunce, ech forme, ech, place, and ech time.

There is nothing new vnto it, there is nothing ſtraunge, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing departeth vnknowne.

               <p>That, that falleth out in tyme was in prouydence, and that that is paſt in tyme remayneth in knowledge.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14611:43"/>
for the profyte, not the profyte for the knowledge. As the knowledge of huſbandry, of weauing, of paynting, &amp;c. where the knowledge is reckued, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnprofytable, except the profyte followeth of it.</p>
               <p>If it were ſo about the wiſedome of God, then ſhould the worke be better, then the workman. Therfore we muſt bold that wiſedome is euer to be loued for the ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now if it ſometimes falleth out that the worke is preferred before wiſdom, it groweth not of the iudgement of the truth, but of the errour of man, for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is lyfe, and the lous of wiſedome is the bleſſedneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when it is ſayde, that the father of wiſedome, delighteth himſelfe in wiſedome, God forbid, that it ſhould be thought that we beléeue, that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his wiſedome for the workes ſake which he made by it: Nay rather he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued none of his workes, but for his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſake. And therfore he ſayd this is my beloued ſonne, in whome I haue ſet my delight, and not in the earth or in the

And to make an ende, whether it be one, and the ſame loue, with the which euerye one loueth himſelfe, and that, with the which euery one loueth another.</p>
               <p>But this will be more eaſie, if we call to rememberaunce the thinges, that be ſpoken of before. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it is proued that GOD is the fyrſt cauſe, and originall of all good things, neyther can there be anye Nobler good, then that, which is the Fountaine and beginning of all. So that it followeth, that God is the chiefe good. Therefore God is bleſſed alone, and properly, and principally. And how can he be bleſſed, which loueth not the ſame, which he is. Whoſoeuer therefore is bleſſed, bothe loueth the ſelfe and the ſubſtaunce. If then the father and the Sonne be one,
<pb facs="tcp:14611:44"/>
and be one God, ſithence, that true bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe is in God alone: It is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> both ech one ſhould loue the ſelfe, and eche one ſhould loue another.</p>
               <p>For it were no true bleſſedneſſe, nay rather it were the chiefe vnhappineſſe, if they ſhould parte themſelues by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie will, and could not be parted one from another for the ſame ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>As therefore the father and the ſonne, and the loue of the father and the ſonne, by nature, and ſubſtance be one: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by will and loue, they muſt néedes be one. Ech one loueth the ſelfe with one loue, bicauſe they be one. Neyther is it any other thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eche one loueth in an other, but that, which eche one loueth in the ſelfe: bicauſe it is no other thing, that eche one is, but the ſame, that the other is.</p>
               <p>That which the Father loueth in the ſonne, the ſame the ſonne loueth in him ſelfe, and that which the loue of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; the ſonne loueth in the ſonne, the verie ſame the ſonne loueth in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Agayne, that which the ſonne loueth in the father, the verie ſame loueth the

               <p>WHen of late I begone to learne thinges not ſeene, by things ſeene, I went from the creature hauing body, to the creature that had no body, I mean the creature pertaker of reaſon. And then from the creature pertaker of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I came to the wiſedome of God. But now going backe agayne, I meane to procéede, fyrſt from the wiſedome of God, to the creature, pertaker of reaſon and next from the creature pertaker of reaſon, to the creature hauing body.</p>
               <p>The one is the order of knowledge, the other of condicion. For the bodilye creature, which is ſéene, is firſt known, then by the bodily creature, we learn to know that without body. Fynally this way of knowledge opened, leadeth vs to the Creator and maker of both.</p>
               <p>But touching condition and ſtate,

for the fyrſt ſteppe. The creature perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made after the Image of God, afterwardes was made the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily creature, that the creature pertaker of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould acknowledge within it, outwardly that, which inwardly it had receaued of the maker.</p>
               <p>In the wiſedome of God is trueth, in the creature pertaker of reaſon, is the Image of truth. In the creature hauing body, is the ſhadow of the Image.</p>
               <p>The creature pertaker of reaſon was made after the wiſedome of God. The creature hauing body was made after the creature pertaker of reaſon. And therefore all mouing and tourning of the bodily creature is after the becke of the reaſonable creature. And euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and tourning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodily creature, ſhould be after the beck of the wiſdome of God. That whilſt ech one doth ſtill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the ſuperioure, they ſhoulde neuer leaue the order of the firſt condition, nor the ſimilitude of the fyrſt example.</p>

               <p>But he that retourneth from the not ſeene, to the ſeene, muſt fyrſt goe downe from the Creator, to the reaſonable cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, next fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reaſonable creature, to the bodily creature.</p>
               <p>The courſe of knowledge in mans mind, doth goe before the order of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For we that are without, cannot retourne from the thinges within, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept fyrſt we Pearce the thinges within with the eye of our mind.</p>
               <p>The order of condition, doth follow the courſe of knowledge, for although mans weakneſſe doth ſomtimes a little enter in, to conſider of inward thinges, yet his infyrmity is ſuch, that he cannot long continue in the ſame.</p>

for Jeſus is expounded Sauyoure. And he is called ſauyoure, becauſe he doeth ſaue men from ſinne and death, to lyfe. For of him ſo ſayeth Saint John, the law was geuen by Moyſes. But mercy and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Paule calleth Chriſt Jeſus the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, and the wiſedome of God.</p>
               <p>If therefore Jeſus Chriſt be the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt, it is euident, that truth came by the wiſedome of God. So truth is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Wiſedome it ſelfe ſpeaketh to the Jewes thus of this day: Your Father Abraham did deſyre to ſée my day, he ſaw it and was glad of it, for the trueth of God is the redemption of mankinde, which he fyrſt promiſed, which ſéeing he afterwardes performed, what did he elſe, but ſhew himſelfe true.</p>
               <p>Then truth was fulfilled by this wiſdome, from the which all truth doth ſpring, neyther was any other ſente to fulfill truth, but he in whom the fulneſſe of al truth was. Therfore did Abraham well reioyce at the day of truth, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:14611:51"/>
he deſyred trueth to be fulfilled, which daye then he ſaw by the holy ghoſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did beleeue that the ſonne of GOD ſhould be incarnate to redeeme man.</p>
               <p>Let it be ſaide: Declare his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from day to day, the ſecond day from the fyrſt daye to the thirde, the daye of truth, from the day of feare, to the days of loue.</p>
               <p>Firſt there was but one day, the day of feare. Then came the ſeconde daye, the daye of truth. It came I ſaye, it dyd not ſuccéede, for the fyrſt did not depart, ſo haue you two dayes. The third ſprang out, the daye of loue. But when that thirde day came, it did not dryue away the two fyrſt. Bleſſed are theſe dayes, in the which men maye growe to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where things to come doe come, and preſent doe not depart, where the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is increaſte, and the brightneſſe multiplyed.</p>
               <p>Firſt men being vnder ſinne, were reproued by the lawe, and beganne to feare GOD as the Judge, becauſe they ſawe their owne guiltineſſe. Then <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now this knowledge was ſome light. Nowe was it daye, but not bright day, for they were yet dimme thorowe the darkeneſſe of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Then came the day of truth, the day of ſaluation, to deſtroy ſinne, to lighten the brightneſſe of the fyrſt daye, and to engender feare, &amp; not to take it away, but to turne it into better.</p>
               <p>Neyther was the brightneſſe yet full, till loue was ioyned to it. For the truth it ſelfe ſayeth. I haue many thinges to ſay vnto you, but you cannot yet beare them, but when that ſpirite of truth ſhal come, he ſhall teach you all truth. So all truth is to this end, to take away the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and to rectify the good.</p>

               <p>The daye of truth doeth make bright the day of feare. The day of loue doeth make bright both the day of feare, and

But you will ſay, you may not leaue to reaſon in matters of religion: Truth it is, if the booke of God teach otherwiſe: But the body of Chriſte hath this peculier and priuate grace, to be in many places at once, not locally: it is as much to ſay, as it hath this peculier grace, to be a body and not bodily: Wherefore I will goe on thus: It can by no meanes be, that a thing made ſhould be euery where, but the body of Chriſt is a thing made, then it can by no meanes be, that the body of Chriſt ſhould be euery where.</p>

fyll all places, it is not a creature, but it is a creature, therefore it doth not fil all places.

But yet the humanitie doth not fyll all places, which the Deity doeth fill.

               <p>Neyther be theſe my deuiſes, but that great Clearke S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh the two natures of Chriſt<note place="margin">Aug. ad Dard.</note> in the ſelfe ſame manner, writing to <hi>Dardanus.</hi> We do not think that it was ſayd according to the humayne nature, which God the word tooke of the Virgin Mary. This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe, for Chriſt as man was not that day in Paradiſe, but in Hell accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſoule, in the graue according to his fleſh. Nowe if by S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Chriſt according to his Godhead were in Paradice or heauen, according to his fleſh in the graue, and yet his Godhead and fleſh not parted, what partition ſhould this bréede of the Godhead and Manhood, to ſay that the naturall body of Chriſt is now only in heauen, and his Godhead both in heauen, and all other places.

<pb facs="tcp:14611:62"/>
that when his naturall body was here vpon earth onely, and not in Heauen: (For according to that Chriſte ſayd, I haue not yet gone vp to your God, and my god, your Father, and my Father.) His Godhead was then both in Earth, and in Heauen. And why doth it not as well ſtand with right fayth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two natures: Now to beleeue that his body is onely in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, according to the ſaying of the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, in the Acts of the Apoſtles: Whom the Heauens muſt holde, &amp;c. and yet his Godhead to be both in Heauen and in Earth, and in euery place.

               <p>All this is ſpoken to ſet down the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers properties of the two natures in Chriſt, his deuine nature and his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature, and to ſhew that a man may well expreſſe the ſeuerall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of eche nature, and yet in no caſe part the one from the other. But I pray you, is there no ſupernaturall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the body of Chriſt, hath it no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues? Did the wonderfull vnion of the moſt holy godhead, poure no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: no force into it? Verie many, but yet not ſuche, as cannot agree with the humaine nature, as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> doth excellently ſay, he gaue to it immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but toke not awaye the nature of it. And againe, we muſte take great héede, that we do not affirme the deitée of the man ſo, that we take awaye the
<pb facs="tcp:14611:65"/>
truth of the body. Therfore the naturall body of Chriſt is made immortall, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryfied, ſanctified, quickned, but it is not made eternall, vnmeaſurable, increat, or infynite, for theſe ouerthrowe the humaine nature.</p>
               <p>And that certaine things be ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the godheade, that at all they doe not agrée to the manhood, but be applyed only in phraſe or ſpeech, and contrary, that certayne thinges be peculiar to the manhood, and doe not at all agree to the godhead, but be applied to it onely by phraſe or ſpeech, is manifeſt: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſte of John. He it is which comming after me, was before me. Neyther to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore John, doeth agrée to the manhood of Chriſt in déede, neither to be after John to the godhead.</p>
               <p>This is alſo manifeſt by theſe ſayings, before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, I am, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater then I, neyther doeth it agrée to the manhood in déede to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Abraham, nor to the godhead to be leſſe then the Father.</p>

Naye, it did take &amp; vnite to the ſelfe the humaine nature. God did purge his church by his bloude. What meaneth this? hath the deuine nature bloud?

               <p>Wherefore thorowe the vnion of the perſon, ſuch things maye be ſpoken in worde, but they cannot agrée in déede. Neyther doth that of ſaint <hi>Baſill</hi> of the birth of Chriſt diſagrée with theſe. How is the godheade in the fleſhe, as the fyre is in the yron, not tranſitiuely, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributiuely. For the fyre doth not runne into the yron, but abyding in the place, doth imparte and beſtowe the peculier facultie vppon it.

<pb facs="tcp:14611:68"/>
body of Chriſte was hungrie, coulde, thirſtie, wearie, and gréeued, and this is<note place="margin">Math 26.</note> true of Chriſt the voyce. My Soule is heauier, euen vnto death. And nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the croſſe he ſayeth: I am dry. He ſuffred truely, he dyed truely, hée was compaſſed about with place truly. I would therefore gladly learne, why the two natures ſhould be ſayd to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, becauſe the ſeuerall proprieties of ech nature be ſet downe after his ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing agayne, rather then they were, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeuerall proprieties of eache nature were ſet downe before his death. For I reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, the body of Chriſt liuing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth was in one certayne and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier place, but the Godhead was in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place. And yet none will ſay that the perſon of Chriſt was then deuided, why then may we not likewiſe ſay, that the body of chriſt being in heauen, is in one certayn and peculier place, and yet not deuide the perſon of Chriſte: For in Chriſtes perſon being vpon earth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte God, and perfect man, were coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together: As S.

               <p>I haue ſet downe the whole words of the holye ghoſt, done out of greeke into Engliſhe, worde by worde: That ſo good a foundation being layde, the reſt that foloweth, myght be the more fyrm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly builded thervpon. Let vs nowe view and waigh all theſe things. Chriſt toke the ſame bread in his hande, which was vpon the table: Chriſt gaue to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the ſame breade, and whiles he was giuing the breade to his diſciples, he ſpeaketh as before: whiles his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples eate this breade, whiles they did brooſe it with their téeth, and ſwallowed it into their ſtomaks, where was chriſt? was be not at the table? did he not ſpeak to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? did he not both eate &amp; drink with them? was he not ſéene, hearde, and
<pb facs="tcp:14611:71"/>
touched. In which place was the bodye of Chriſt: In the mouth and ſtomack of his diſciples, or at the table, where they both ſawe Chriſt, and heard Chriſt? if you ſay in both places: Then this follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth: That eyther Chriſt had two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or elſe that there was two chriſts, both which aunſweres be very vngodly and abſurde.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay the words be plaine, for Chriſt ſaide plainely and diſtinctly. This is my body: This is my bloude. Neyther is it lyke, that Chriſt woulde ſpeake doubtfully, in the laſt talke, that he had with his diſciples. I graunt the words be plaine after the maner of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, in the which things ſubiect to the ſenſe, doe repreſent and ſhewe things, which be taken onely of a godly minde, and by a religious fayth. I graunt that Chriſt gaue his bodye and that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples toke it, and eate it, not after a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and groſſe maner, but after a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, that is he heauenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. What then doe you denie, that the breade is the bodye of Chriſt: That the wine is the bloud of Chriſt? not I true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb facs="tcp:14611:72"/>
But I ſaye, that they be ſo in truth of religion, ſacrament, and miſtery, and not by chaunging of nature, element, or ſubſtaunce. For Chriſt doth call the breade his body, but he doth not ſay that it is chaunged into his bodye.</p>
               <p>Then you call it breade, and the holye writer of this holy Storie doth himſelfe call it breade, the wordes be theſe. He toke breade: he gaue thankes: he brake: he gaue: doth he not meane by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of wordes, to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plaine: I praye you, what toke he? bread. What brake he? the ſame bread. What gaue he the ſame bread? For that that he toke, that he brake: and that that he brake, that he gaue to hys Diſciples: and that that he gaue to his diſciples, that did his diſciples eate. But bicauſe it is a miſtery, which is in hand. Therfore it repreſenteth the great and heauenly things, which the holy words of the high prieſt of our Lorde and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt Jeſus doe declare. This is my body ſayth he: which is broken for you, doe this in rememberance of me. Againe, of the Cup of wine: This Cup
<pb facs="tcp:14611:72"/>
is the newe Teſtament in my bloude, which is ſhedde for you. What meane theſe wordes? what ſence haue they? what ſignifye they? ſome prodigious thing, or newe thing, or light thing, or thing of ſmale value? No. But the moſt certaine teſtifycation and aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; life euerlaſting, which we obtaine by the death of Chriſt, and which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the outwarde elementes of bread and wine, but receiued only by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> inward hand of fayth, and ſéene onely by the inwarde eye of Fayth.</p>
               <p>Chriſt gaue to his diſciples bread and wine, ye, he gaue alſo vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his body and blood, that they by fayth being fed, with this heae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nly bread &amp; this heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinke, might haue life euerlaſting, which to printe more ſurely in their harts, he playnly telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed body y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was to be rent for them, and his precious blood that was to be ſhedde for them, and for many other, that God the Father being pacified with this rich ſacrifice, might forgeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ſinnes. Therfore he called this a new league, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:14611:73"/>
a new teſtament often promiſed by the holy Prophets, which was to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not by the blood of beaſtes, but by the ſheadding of his holy and precious blood: wherefore his will and pleaſure was that this miſtery of ſo great things ſhould be celebrated euer in publique aſſemblies, both that the remembrance of hym might euer be freſhe with hys, and that often thankes might be geuen to God the father, &amp; that his louers and profeſſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But thus much at large, the reſt more briefly, that truth may be ſooner picked out and more plainely appere: For as <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> ſaieth of Philoſophers. So I thinke Deuines bounde to briefe arguments. That which chriſt toke, he brake: that which he brake, he gaue to his Diſciples: that which he gaue to his diſciples, he called his body: Therefore he called breade his bodye. For he toke breade, brake breade, and gaue it to his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>But that which is breade by nature,
<pb facs="tcp:14611:73"/>
is not the ſubſtance of Chriſtes bodye. Except we will prodigiouſly confounde the ſubſtance of things, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente the naturall bodye of Chriſt, is not really, and bodily, in the ſacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt. But here is made a ſtoppe: that Chriſt bleſſed the bread after he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, as S. Mathew and S. Marck ſayeth, by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there followed ſuch a chaunge, that although he tooke bread, yet he neyther brake bread, nor gaue bread: This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtication is called of the Logitians: <hi>Petitio Principij:</hi> For fyrſt S. Marcke doth not ſay, that Chriſt bleſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread but that when he had taken, he bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the gréeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth as well ſygnify to geue thanks, as to bleſſe, and that it ſygnifyeth there to geue thankes, becauſe the holy ghoſt is the beſt expounder of it ſelfe: Both S. Luke &amp; S. Paule, declare, which both for that worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, vſe this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifyeth ſo geue thanks, and not to bleſſe. Thirdly, as it was me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread. So was it
<pb facs="tcp:14611:74"/>
mente touching the Cuppe and Wyne: But both Mathew and Marcke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſpeaking of the Cuppe or wyne, vſe not thys worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but the ſaide worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Therfore it is manifeſt, that both they ment, hée gaue thankes, after that he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bread, and he gaue thanckes after he had taken the Cuppe. Briefely thus: that that is true about the bread, is true alſo about the Cuppe of wyne, but the cuppe or the wyne haue ioyned vnto them, no wordes of conſecration, or tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, or chaunging of one ſubſtaunce into another, as it appereth by S. Luke and S. Paule. Therefore the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is God, that breade was taken, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread was broken, and that bread was geuen to the Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Adde to theſe that S. Paule in the xx. Chapter, and fyrſt Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, aduiſedly &amp; purpoſely ſpeaking of the Lords ſupper, ſayeth, is not the bread which we breake the partaking of body of Chriſt. And Luke in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the Actes. They did continue together
<pb facs="tcp:14611:74"/>
in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, &amp; in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and breaking of bread, &amp; a little after he ſayeth, that the Diſciples came together to breake bread, by the which it is neceſſarily concluded, that the ſame was broken which was taken and that that was broken was geuen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and of that that was geuen did Chriſt ſay this is my body. Therefore chriſt did ſay of bread, this is my body. For as Chriſte ment of the bread, ſo he ment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine, but he ment of wyne to be drawen and drunke, as it appeareth by Marcke and Mathew, where he ſayd, I will drincke no more of the fruite of this wyne, &amp;c. Therefore he ment alſo that bread, that was eaten.</p>
               <p>Agayne if the ſubſtaunce of the bread be chaunged into the ſubſtaunce of the body. Then the ſubſtaunce of the wine ſhould be chaunged to the ſubſtaunce of the blood, but in the ſecond place, not the ſubſtaunce of wyne, but the ſubſtaunce of the cuppe ſhould be chaunged into the new Teſtamente, by the wordes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as their terme is: For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mathew and Marck briefely ſaye:
<pb facs="tcp:14611:75"/>
This is my blood, Luke and Paule doe ſet downe at large, this cuppe is the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my blood. But you will ſay that the cuppe doth ſignify the wine in the cuppe, by a fygure called <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomia:</hi> Then you graunt that the holy Ghoſt doth ſpeake fyguratiuely in the matter of the Sacrament, but let that goe, and let it be, this wyne is the new teſtament in my blood, if the wyne ſhould be chaunged, it muſt be changed into the newe Teſtamente of Chriſtes blood, but that ſpéech ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand, except it be vnderſtood fyguratiuely and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually thus.</p>
               <p>This Wine is a viſible ſigne of mine new inuiſible league, couenaunt, will, grace, and mercy, which ſhall be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſealed with the ſheadding of my blood.</p>
               <p>Then neyther the fyrſte wordes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bread, implye any chaunge of ſubſtaunce, but haue a ſpirituall and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue meaning: For whether you ſay the cuppe or the wyne, the ſpéech muſt needes be fyguratiue. For neither the cuppe or the wyne eyther is or can
<pb facs="tcp:14611:75"/>
be properly called a teſtamente. Nowe if the ſecond ſpéech of the wyne do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply two figures at the leaſte, why ſhould it ſeeme ſo ſtrange to ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the firſt ſpéech of the bread deth alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a figure.</p>
               <p>Doe you then, ſaye you thinke, that Chriſt ſpake doubtfully? and woulde in his laſt departure leaue hys Churche doubtfully? Not I truely. Why then do you talke of figures and troupes? and figuratiue ſpeeches, and ſpirituall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not euerye figuratiue ſpeeche is doubtfull, and it is as great a faulte to refuſe a figure, when the place geueth it, as to force a figure when there is none. And it is moſt manifeſt by Saint Luke and ſaint Paule, that the ſecond ſpeech of the Cup or wine is figuratiue, and hath a ſpirituall ſence. For bothe they expounding the briefe wordes ſet downe by ſaint Mathew, and S. Marke expreſſely ſaye, that Chriſt ſaide, this Cup is the newe Teſtamente in my blood. And what ſence or meaning can theſe wordes haue? but this, that in
<pb facs="tcp:14611:76"/>
this ſacrament there is deliuered vnto Chriſtians a viſible and moſt certayne ſigne or ſeale, of that new inuiſible, truſe, will, grace, and mercie, which God hath made and aſſured hys church of, in theſe more mylde and gracyous dayes, and would ſeale and ratify with the bloude of his ſonne. For the words in S. Luke doe proue this ſence, which he addeth of Chriſt, ſaying: Doe this in rememberance of me, and alſo of ſaint Paule. Ye ſhall thewe the Lordes death vntill he come. Neyther here do I doubt that the true, godly &amp; learned wil thinke that I haue not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuerently of this moſt holye and bleſſed miſterie. For I geue more honor and reuerence to it by a great deale, then any that doth fanſye a groſſe and carnall preſence. But ſome will ſaye that I ouerthrowe all, &amp; bring all to naught, and make the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nothing elſe but a péece of bread, and a little wine: that is a moſt falſe and malicious ſlaunder. For I moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely beléeue it to be one of the moſt precious Jewels that Chriſt left to hys church, and that both the body and blood
<pb facs="tcp:14611:76"/>
of Chriſt is truely and effectually exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the power and grace of God, and truely and effectually receaued by the fayth of the chriſtian receyuer. But ſuch men deale with me, as they &amp; ſuch other deale with good preachers, which to pull downe the pryde of mans harte, telleth him, that he is nothing but duſt, earth, aſhes, and ſmoke and graſſe, and then a worldling wyll ſaye, that, that preacher maketh a man no better then a beaſt. Whereas the preacher mente this onely of the one parte of man, that is, his body, wiſedome, beautie glorye, pompe, and porte, which in déede be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but duſt, and graſſe &amp; ſmoke, that fade and periſhe away, and not of the ſeconde parte of manne, that is hys ſoule, which is immortall and eternall, and certainly as man hath two partes, the firſt the bodys which is viſible &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the ſeconde his ſoule which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible and eternall, euen ſo this holye and bleſſed ſacrament hath two partes.

A Paynter ſayeth he, that is to paynt the ſtory of ſome famous victory doth fyrſt draw the Line amentes of men, Horſe, Citties, and Caſtles in obſeure lines, and then he that would diſcerne them muſt both know them perfectly, and view them earneſtly. Secondly, he addeth to the colloures and due proportion to eache, and then any that knew them, ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cearne them at the fyrſt ſyght. GOD is this Paynter that paynteth the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the famous victorye of his deare ſonne, which he had ouer the Deuill, Death, Hell, and ſinne. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iſraelites be like vnto the fyrſt draught. The Sacramente of the
<pb facs="tcp:14611:80"/>
Chriſtians, be like vnto the ſeconde draught. The ſame Aucthour compareth their ſacraments to the lighte of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and ours to the brightneſſe of the ſunne. Saynt Paule compareth them to a childe, and vs to a ful perfect man. So that Chriſt that is ſeene, or ſignified is al one, the ſéers or the thing ſignifying be diuers. For the Jewes ſawe Chriſt in the law, we in the ghoſpell. The law is a darke ſhadowe: the ghoſpell is a perfect Image. The Jewes ſaw Chriſt in the ſea, in the clowde, in the rocke, in Manna, in the bloude of Eoates and Calfes. We ſée Chriſt in the ſacrament of baptiſme, in the ſacrament of hys bodye and bloud by himſelfe ordayned. The difference is this, they ſawe hym ſomwhat darkly, we ſée him very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They ſaw the ſame light that we do, but not in like quantitie, they ſawe the ſame Image that we doe, but not with lyke colours and furniture. And if he would alſo then inferre, that the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall breade by this reaſon were no better then common breade, I vtterlye deny that too. For they differ as much
<pb facs="tcp:14611:81"/>
as heauen and earth, as the ſpirite and the bodie. For the common breade is earthly foode: the ſacramentall bread heauenly foode: the common breade hath force onely to foode the body: the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall breade hath force to féede bothe bodye and ſoule: and to vnite and make them partes of Chriſtes miſticall body. For by the faithfull recepte of it, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules be made cleane by hys bodye and ſoule, and there to ſpiritually ioyned. But yet euen as old bread when it is ſet vpon the table, is in ſubſtaunce the ſelfe ſame that it was, when it was taken hotte oute of the Ouen, but in qualitie muche differing, as the one time colde, ſtale, and drye, at the other tyme, hotte, newe, and moyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. Euen ſo the ſacramentall breade in ſubſtance is the ſelfe ſame, when it is eaten of the faythfull, that it was when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter tooke it fyrſt into his handes, but yet in qualitie excéeding much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as at the one time earthly, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely, at the other time heauenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>

                  </gap>plaine ſlaunder, that manye doe vrge againſt thoſe, that deny the reall and corporall preſence, &amp; make an heauenlye ſpirituall foode, that they make nothing of this bleſſed ſacrament.

and he did eate the Lorde his bread, but it was not to him ſpirituall, it was not to him the Lorde. Some alſo ſay, we do make nothing of this moſt bleſſed ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let any indifferent perſon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who doeth more. They aſcribe and binde al the graces of the ſacrifice, to the intencion of the ſacrificer. For <hi>Gabriell Biell</hi> doeth ſaye, that it belongeth to the<note place="margin">Iabriel Biel.</note> prieſt to determine and limit the force, vertue and grace of this ſacrifice, that it may be beſtowed vpon ſuch, and ſuche néeding it, as a rewarde to be geuen.

name or ſacrifice vnder heauen, wherby we can be ſaued, but only by the name of Jeſus chriſt. That theſe things ought to make the heart to tremble. For that therin is laid forth the miſtery that was hidde from worlds and generations, the horrour of ſinne, the death of the ſonne of God, that he tooke our heauineſſe, and bare our ſorrowes, and was wounded for our offences, and was rent and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for our wickedneſſe, that he was carryed like an innocente Lambe vnto the flaughter, that he cried vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: O God, my God, why haſte thou for ſaken me? There we call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce the ſhame of the Croſſe, the darckning of the ayre, the ſhaking of the earth, the renting of the vale, the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the rockes, the opening of the graues, how Chriſt came to his paſſion, how he was wounded in the ſyde, howe blood and water iſſued and ſtreamed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wounde. They thinke it ynough to bow the knées of the body, to ſtretche forth the handes of the body, to lifte vp the eyes of the body, and to looke vppon the ſacramentall bread, and the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall

Cuppe, and that they thinke might ſerue once a yeare. We teach quarterly, monthly, weekely, dayly, to bow the knées of the body, and the knées of the ſeule, to ſtretch forth the handes of the body, and the handes of the ſoule, to lift vp the eyes of the body, and the eyes of the ſoule, and by farth the mouth of the ſoule to feede of the bleſſed &amp; glorious body of our Lord &amp; ſauiour chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>They teach that in it, they doe eate the naturall body of Chriſt, and drinke the naturall blood of Chriſte naturally and ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſibly. But by this ſpiritual, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and heauenly receipt of the bleſſed ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we ſay, teach and beleeue, that we receaue though not naturally and corporally, yet ſpiritually, truely and effectually our Lord and ſauyour Chriſt Jeſus the true and naturall ſonne of God, conſubſtantiall and coequall with the Father in all poyntes, and that hée is made vnto vs the fulneſſe of all grace and truth. The Lambe of God that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away our ſinnes, the ladder &amp; gate of heauen, the aduaunced Serpent that healeth our poyſoned ſoules, the ſonne

               <p>They thinke they doe much aduance ſhe omnipotent power of God, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe their faith, for that they teach and beleue that the ſubſtaunce of the breade is changed into the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt, and the ſubſtaunce of wine into the ſubſtance of the bloude of Chriſt naturally, corporally, and really. We knowe that we doe a great deale more aduaunce the omnipotent power of God, and more mightily exerciſe our faith, and further carrie our ſelues from ſence and reaſon in beleeuing the inuiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but moſt marueylous graces &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that God hath graunted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this moſt bleſſed ſacrament: For we beleue, that we ſpiritually, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, truely and effectually eate the fleſhe of Chriſt, and drinke his bloude: Dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in vs, be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with vs,
<pb facs="tcp:14611:87"/>
that our ſinneful bodies be made cleane by his body, and our ſoules waſhed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe his moſt precious bloude, that we be aſſured of the forgiueneſſe of oure ſins, and all other benefits of the death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, that we be filled with heauenly grace, and benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we be aſſured of God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, and goodneſſe towarde vs, that we be liuely members incorporated in the miſticall bodye of Chriſt Jeſus, and be beyres thorowe hope of his euerlaſting kingdome.</p>
