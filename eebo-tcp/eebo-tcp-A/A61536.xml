            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Intention of Writing and
Publishing the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
was to give a stop, if possible,
to a Dangerous and Prevailing Practise;
and so much the more Dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is managed with so much Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
and Persons are often drawn into
it, before they are aware of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of it. They are told, <q>That
there is no Law against it; and
that there are Adjudged Cases and
Precedents in Law for it; and that
there is nothing amiss in the Bond of
Resignation it self: but if there be
any corrupt or evil Practice after it,
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:55952:3"/>
that makes it fit to be condemned in
<hi>Equity,</hi> but not in <hi>Law.</hi>
               </q> But a
general Bond of Resignation of a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
upon Notice, in order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Presentation to that Benefice, hath
such a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Appearance; that
any person who pretends to Conscience
cannot but think it necessary to Examine,
how far such a Practice can be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent,
not only with the Law, but with
the Oath which he is to take against <hi>all
Simoniacal Contracts and Promises,
directly or indirectly</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for or
concerning the procuring or obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Rectory or Vicarage of</hi> &amp;c.
How can any man that enters into these
Bonds, say that he doth it not in order
to the <hi>Obtaining</hi> a Presentation?
And doth not such a Bond amount to a
<hi>Contract?</hi> How then can they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
themselves in taking this Oath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
such a Bond? All they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
is, <hi>that although it be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi>
               <pb n="iij" facs="tcp:55952:3"/>
               <hi>for such an End, yet it is no
Simoniacal Contract.</hi> But which
way are we to be satisfied in point of
Conscience, what is a <hi>Simoniacal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi>
and what not? Is it only from
the Statute 31 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 6. so that what
is there forbidden is <hi>Simoniacal</hi> and
nothing else? But where hath that
Law determin'd what <hi>Simony</hi> is, when
it is never mentioned in it? It severely
prohibits some corrupt Practises as to
Benefices; but it never goes about to
restrain the Notion of <hi>Simony</hi> to
them (as will appear in the following
Discourse) and the <hi>Ecclesiastical
Laws,</hi> as to this matter, are left as
they were before. If therefore there be
such a true Notion of a <hi>Simoniacal
Contract,</hi> as is allowed by our Laws,
which is not confined to that Statute;
then it must follow, that there may be a
<hi>Simoniacal Contract,</hi> which is not
condemned by that Law: and therefore
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:55952:4"/>
all persons who understand the Nature
and Extent of our Laws, will have a
care of Restraining the Nature of a
<hi>Simoniacal Contract</hi> to the Letter
of that Statute.</p>
            <p>It may be said, <q>that a <hi>Simonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Contract</hi> is an ill Name put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we know not what, if we go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Law of the Land: and that
there must be some certain bounds
set to such hard Words; or else the
snare may be greater another way:
and that here is no such thing as
Real <hi>Simony</hi> in the case; but the
Word is applied to some indirect Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
in obtaining Benefices, but what
those are the Law must determine.</q>
To which I answer, that I am very far
from going beyond <hi>the Law of the
Land</hi> for determining this matter. For
I do acknowledge that since the Notion
of <hi>Simony</hi> is extended beyond the first
Occasion of the Name, there must be a
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:55952:4"/>
certain Rule to determin it; and That I
do freely grant is <hi>the Law of the Land.</hi>
But by it, I do not mean a particular
Statute made with respect to some more
notorious Acts, which are punishable in
the Courts of Common Law; but I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by <hi>the Law of England</hi> that
Comprehensive Body of Laws, which
have been here receiv'd, as the Measure
of our Iudgment and Actions in those
things which are to be determin'd by
them.</p>
            <p>If a Question be made whether a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
made at Sea be a good Contract;
it will be no good Answer, to say it must
be a good Contract, because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it contrary to the Rules of the
Common Law. For, if our Common
Law should happen to allow such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
which the Civil Law doth not;
will it be ground enough to Affirm, that
it is a good Contract because our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law doth not condemn it? No
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:55952:5"/>
certainly. But it must be determin'd
by that Law which is proper for it, and
being here receiv'd for such, is in such
Cases the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>So I say here; the Ecclesiastical Law,
so far as it is receiv'd and allow'd by the
Common Law, is the Rule and Measure,
whereby the Nature of <hi>Simony</hi> is to
be determin'd; and that is allow'd by
our most learned and judicious Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of our Common Law, to be of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Cognisance:</hi> only such Acts
as come under Statutes belong to the
Courts of Common Law. And there was
a general Presumption in Law before,
that no Patron was to make any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to himself of a Right of Presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">3. Inst. 156.</note> 
               <hi>That a Guardian in Socage of
a Manor whereunto an Advowson is
appendant shall not present to the
Church, because he can take nothing
for the Presentation for the which he
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:55952:5"/>
may account to the Heir:</hi> from whence
he infers, that <hi>Simony is odious in
the Eye of the Common Law.</hi> And
it is very well if it so continues; which
I can hardly imagine, if these <hi>Bonds
of Resignation</hi> prevail. But if by
the <hi>Ecclesiastical Law,</hi> as received
here, such Bonds are <hi>Simoniacal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Contract in order to the obtaining
a Presentation; then it can give little
satisfaction to any Man's Conscience to
be told, <hi>that they are not against
Law,</hi> i.e. against the <hi>Statute 31 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.
c.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>My business is not here to give a
full Account of the Matters contained in
the following Discourse; but only to
remove some general Prejudices against
the Design of it. Which is truly no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to bring this secret Practice
into open View, and to have it fairly
Examin'd and Discussed. For, while
it is managed in this manner, there is not
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:55952:6"/>
only Mischief done to the Church, but
to the Consciences of Men; who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apt to suspect a Snare in all such
Bonds, and are very uneasie at the
thoughts of them afterwards. If there
be any better Reasons to be given for
them, than I have yet seen; I should be
glad to be convinced of the Lawfulness
of such indirect Practises and Private
Contracts: but at present I think (if
they be not timely prevented) they will
end in unspeakable Mischief to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Clergy,</hi> who are the main Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Body of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and in whose welfare we ought
to be all concerned.</p>
            <p>And truly I cannot but be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in what relates to Their <hi>Rights;</hi> for
their Work and Duty is Great and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious,
if it be performed as it ought to
be; and they ought not to have any new
Burdens imposed upon them, under a
pretence of Law, which neither they nor
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:55952:6"/>
their Successors will be able to bear.</p>
            <p>I am very sensible, how much in this
Age depends upon the Faithfulness and
Diligence and Good Reputation of the
<hi>Parochial Clergy</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For
I am not much afraid of any Designs of
our open Enemies (or which may be
worse, of our pretended Friends) if we
be true to our selves; i. e. if we seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and conscientiously do our Duties
with respect to God, the People, and
our own Souls. If we do not give way
to unreasonable Suspicions and causeless
Iealousies of one another; if we mind
the Interest of Religion more than our
own, and serve God and not our own
Lusts; if we sincerely promote the
best Ends in the World, the saving
Souls and doing good to Mankind; God
will not be wanting to us: but He that
hath saved us from the <hi>Lion and the
Bear,</hi> will likewise save us from the
<hi>Fox and the Viper;</hi> I mean such who
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:55952:7"/>
under fair and plausible pretences eat
through the Bowels of their Mother;
and by secret and indirect Practises go
about to ruine the Church they <hi>profess
themselves</hi> to be of: although <hi>by
their Works they deny it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I had not some more than ordinary
Reason to believe such things to be not
only Practised but Incouraged by such
who pretend, not only to understand our
Law, but to Direct the Nation in it; I
should hardly have undertaken a Task of
this Nature. But having so just an
occasion to search into this Matter, as
well as I could, and finding so much
Cause of Dissatisfaction as to these
Bonds; I thought it my Duty to doe
what lay in me to prevent that Mischief
which is hastning upon our Church by
them. If I am mistaken in any part of
the following Discourse, I shall be glad
to be better informed: and if I am not,
I hope that our Church may receive no
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:55952:7"/>
disadvantage by it. And as I honour
the Profession of the Law, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Worthy Persons, who are and have
been of it: so I cannot but be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to find some Pretenses of Law made
use of to such ill Purposes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
that if the number of Patrons
that are against our Established Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should happen to exceed those that are
for it; by the help of these <hi>Bonds of
Resignation,</hi> the Title to most of our
<hi>Parochial Cures</hi> would in a little time
fall into the hands of <hi>Popish Priests:</hi>
which would much facilitate the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their Religion; when so many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Incumbents</hi> would so easily be
turned out, by no other means, but by
these <hi>Bonds of Resignation.</hi> And
therefore it is not meerly the <hi>Interest</hi> of
our <hi>Parochial Clergy,</hi> but of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
which lies at stake. And this
I suppose will be sufficient to justify this
Undertaking.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
CONCERNING
Bonds of Resignation &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Design of this Discourse,
is to Enquire into a Case,
too commonly Practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, and too little Examin'd;
which is concerning <hi>Bonds of Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
given by Clergymen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
in order to the obtaining a
Presentation to a Benefice with Cure
of Souls. This is a Case which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Conscience:</hi> and
it is not so easy a matter, as some
seem to take it for granted, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55952:9"/>
it as to either of them. For if
such a Practice be within the Reason
and Intention of the Law, which
forbids all <hi>Corrupt Presentations</hi> and
<hi>Resignations, 31 Eliz. c.</hi> 6. then it
cannot be Justified by Law; and if
it be against the Scope and Design
of the Oath against <hi>Simoniacal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,</hi>
then it can much less be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
in point of Conscience. And
whether it be or not, is the Subject
of this present Discourse; which I
am sorry there is so much occasion
for; but since there are too many
that Practise it, and others too ready
to Defend it; and since it is of so
mischievous Consequence to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if
it prevails<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think it highly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to enquire more strictly into this
Matter, than hath been hitherto
done. Which I shall do in such a
manner, as to make it appear that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55952:9"/>
no Considerations whatsoever have
swayed me, but those of <hi>Law</hi> and
<hi>Conscience;</hi> and I hope those who
have been drawn into such Snares
will see cause to Repent, (if they do
it not already) and others take care
how they run themselves into such
Perplexities, which no Precedents
in point of Law, and no Authority
in point of Conscience can give
them Satisfaction in.</p>
            <p>But I intend no Reflections on
particular Persons; and I cannot
believe that any who have imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
weighed these things can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Lawfulness of them so, as
to wish them <hi>generally practised.</hi> For,
however there may be some Cases
wherein such Bonds may be thought
far more Reasonable than in others:
yet it cannot be denied that there
are far more Cases, wherein such a
Practice must be destructive to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55952:10"/>
Legal Rights of the Church. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some Patrons to be Persons of
great Piety and Integrity, who do
require these Bonds only to bind the
Clergy the more strictly to do their
Duty: suppose others have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their own Interest, but only
take care of Minors, bred up with a
prospect of such Benefices which
they are not yet capable of: (which
are the most Reasonable Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
insisted upon in the Adjudged
Cases:) but what are these to the
multitude of most unjust and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Considerations, which may
be made the Conditions of these
Bonds? For the Bonds are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be General; and so the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
left at liberty to impose their
own Conditions. And, are there
no such kind of Patrons among us
who may be too justly suspected to
mind their own Interest above the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55952:10"/>
Churches Good? and therefore will
take all ways to lessen the Profits of
Benefices in their Disposal, as far as
they are told that the Law permits
them? Such I mean, who have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
but what the Law lays upon
them, having no Sense of Honour
or Conscience in these matters. And
if it once pass for an allowed Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
in Law, that <hi>Bonds of Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
are lawfull; what shall stop
such Men from putting very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Conditions upon their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents,
or else they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
call them to an Account for
the Forfeiture of their Bonds? If
then there be no effectual course so
much as offer'd, against very hard
and unreasonable Terms; how can
such Bonds be thought Just and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable?</p>
            <p>It may be said, <hi>That if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
be such as are allowed by Law,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55952:11"/>
then the Bonds are lawfull, otherwise
not.</hi> But this by no means clears the
Difficulty. For the main Question
is, Whether such Bonds be lawfull,
where the Conditions are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
but meer notice of three or
six Months? And these are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Bonds of Resignation: and
such I think I may with Reason af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to be against both Law and
Conscience. But suppose there may
be Conditions of both kinds requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but it is not expressed in the
Bonds what they are: what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Slavery must the Clergy be
under, who give general Bonds, and
know not what Conditions will be
required? And then they must go to
Law, and be at greater Charge and
Trouble than they can well bear, to
know whether the Conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of them be such as the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
or not? So that the general
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55952:11"/>
Allowance of Bonds of Resignation
upon Notice, although the Law be
left to determine the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
is that which we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to look upon as very hard and
unjust, and inconsistent with the
Nature and Design of that Relation
which the Law supposes between
Patrons and Incumbents, as will
appear more afterwards.</p>
            <p>There are two things chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on by those who plead for
these Bonds of Resignation:</p>
            <p>I. That there is no Law against
them;</p>
            <p>II. That there have been Cases
adjudged for them: and both these
I shall carefully examine.</p>
            <p>I. That there is no Law against
them. There are two Laws to be
consider'd in this matter:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55952:12"/>
1. The Law against Simoniacal
Contracts 31 <hi>Eliz;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Law which requires eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Incumbent to take an Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Simony.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As to the Law against Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
Contracts: The Statute is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
against</hi> Presenting to a Benefice
for a Summ of Money, Reward, Gift,
Profit or Benefit, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
or entring into Bond or Covenant
for that purpose; 31 <hi>Eliz. c. 6. n. 5.
Wherein these things are observable:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) That it is not a meer <hi>Summ of
Money</hi> which is here forbidden, <hi>but
any Benefit whatsoever, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) That not meer <hi>doing</hi> the thing,
but <hi>entring into Bond or Covenant to
do it</hi> is within the reach of this Law.</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>That the Penalty is against
such</hi> who do Present for or by Reason
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55952:12"/>
of any Promise or Agreement for any
Benefit whatsoever: or those who do
accept such Presentations on those terms:
i. e. <hi>so as it becomes the Motive of
such Presentation or Acceptance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(4.) <hi>That the same Law declares</hi>
n. 8. <hi>against</hi> corrupt Resigning or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing
the Benefice he enjoys, for any
Summ of Money or Benefit whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>(5.) That the Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
still remain in Force against
these Offences: which supposes that
this Law doth not supersede the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Laws here in being. <hi>n.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>So that here are two material
Questions to be resolved upon this
Statute.</p>
            <p>[1.] Whether since the making
this Statute, there be any Simoniacal
Contract, but what is against the
Purport of it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55952:13"/>
[2.] Whether a Bond of Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon which a Benefice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and accepted, be within the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it?</p>
            <p>[1.] As to the former; it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that the words <hi>Simony</hi> or <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
Contract</hi> are never mentioned
in this Statute. For, if they had,
the Judges would have had sufficient
Reason to have declared what was
<hi>Simony</hi> and what not. We are told
indeed by the Reverend and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Judges in the Case of <hi>Mackaller</hi>
and <hi>Todderick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. Car. 361.</note> 
               <hi>That the Consideration
to have Money to procure one to be Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of a Church is a Simoniacal Contract,
and an unlawfull Act condemned by all
Laws: and that the Common Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Statute</hi> 31 Eliz. <hi>took notice of
it.</hi> But they do not declare how far
the Common Law could take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, before that Statute; any
farther than that it was not a thing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55952:13"/>
allowed by it. For certainly it was
then of Spiritual Cognisance: and
the Persons guilty of it were to be
proceeded against by the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Laws. And consequently,
the Notion of <hi>Simony</hi> is to be taken
from thence, and not meerly from
this Statute: so that if Accepting a
Benefice upon giving a Bond of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
were <hi>Simoniacal</hi> before, it
doth not cease to be so by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
Indeed <hi>corrupt Resignation</hi> of a
Benefice hath not the same Penalty
by this Statute with <hi>corrupt Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
of it at first: for that is a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability,
and the other double the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.
But hereby we see that the one
is against the Law, as much as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So far then it is clear by this
Statute, that any <hi>corrupt Resignation</hi>
is against Law: and if the Enquiry
be after the Penalty, the Statute must
determine that. But if the Question
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55952:14"/>
be, Whether Resignation upon a Bond
given before-hand in order to a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
be a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Act or not,
as done in Pursuance of a <hi>Simoniacal
Contract?</hi> in That the Statute gives
no Rule; but only declares the
Penalties of some particular Acts,
which are there expressed.</p>
            <p>Those who would have nothing
now to be <hi>Simony,</hi> but what is
there forbidden, must first prove
that the Intention of the Law was
to Limit and Determine the Nature
of Simony; which (as is already
observed) is not so much as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in it. The Reason of the Law
as to Penalties is one thing, and the
Nature of a <hi>Simoniacal Contract</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If a Question be put, whether
a <hi>Simoniacal Contract</hi> be void in Law
or not?<note place="margin">3. Inst. 153. Marg.</note> my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith, <hi>That
the Statute doth not make the Bond,
Covenant, Promise, or other Assurance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55952:14"/>
void, but the Presentment</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and so
it was adjudged</hi> 40 Eliz. This is
somewhat strange Doctrine: that a
<hi>Presentment</hi> should be <hi>void</hi> by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a <hi>Simoniacal Bond,</hi> and yet
that Bond not be void <hi>in Law.</hi> For
that which makes another thing
void, one would think should be
void in it self: especially since he
saith in the same Chapter,<note place="margin">F. 156.</note> 
               <hi>That Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is odious in the Eye of the Common
Law.</hi> But not so very <hi>odious:</hi> if a
<hi>Simoniacal Contract</hi> be a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
according to the Common
Law. But he distinguisheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Malum in se against the Common
Law, and Malum prohibitum by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Law.</hi> How doth this clear the
point? The Presentation is void,
being prohibited by the Statute:
But is not a Simoniacal Contract
<hi>malum in se</hi> against the Common
Law? how then comes This not to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55952:15"/>
be void? especially since it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractus
ex turpi causâ:</hi> and for that
Reason my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> held it
void in Law;<note place="margin">Hob. f. 167.</note> and so the Court held
in <hi>Mackaller</hi>'s Case.<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 361.</note> But suppose
my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in the right as to a
Simoniacal Contract; that it is not
void at Common Law: it follows
from thence, that the Consideration
of Law and Conscience is different
in this matter. For I suppose none
will deny that a Simoniacal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
is unlawfull in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
and yet he asserts it, not to
be void in Law. Why then may
not Bonds of Resignation, although
not within the compass of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
yet be unlawful in point of
Conscience: as well as a Simoniacal
Contract be unlawful in point of
Conscience, and yet be good by the
Common Law? Either therefore
Simony, as odious as it is in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55952:15"/>
Eye of the Law, must not be <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
in se against Common Law,</hi> as my
Lord <hi>Coke</hi> speaks: or if it be, there
must be another Rule of Conscience
in this matter from this Statute. I
would fain know, what was <hi>Simony</hi>
at <hi>Common Law</hi> before this Statute:
and whether that which was so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not continue so still, if
it be not taken away by it? For,
if there be no <hi>Simony</hi> now, but what
is expressed in that Statute: then it
must declare; what is <hi>Simony</hi> and
what not. <hi>Simony,</hi> saith my Lord
<hi>Coke, is described by this Act, 31 Eliz.</hi>
and he saith in his Margin, <hi>Injustum
est illa vendere, quae gratis distribui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent:</hi>
which is a very good Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. But the Question is, what
is meant by <hi>Selling?</hi> whether it be
meerly for a Summ of Money, paid
down, or secured by Bond or
Covenant? or whether it doth not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55952:16"/>
take in any kind of Benefit or Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument
accruing to the Person who
bestows it, which hinders it from
being a Free Gift? The Casuists
say,<note place="margin">Sylvestr. v. Simon.</note> 
               <hi>Nomine emptionis &amp; venditionis
intelligitur omnis contractus non gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
But can that be called a Free
Gift, where there is a Bond of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of such a thing, whereof
the Possession and Reversion bear a
Price, and have a real Value? We
need not run to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what <hi>Turpe Commercium</hi> is.
There were many Laws among the
old <hi>Romans</hi> against purchasing any
Publick Offices;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sigon.</hi> de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. l. 2. c. 30.</note> and they thought
it a great Reproach to them for any
Price to be set upon them: as the
great <hi>Roman</hi> Master said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quintil.</hi> l. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Pretium
quod habet, hoc ipso vilescit.</hi> By the
Laws <hi>Acilia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                     <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ro</hi> Plancio. Dion. <hi>l.</hi> 36.</note> and <hi>Calpurnia,</hi> all
that were Convict of giving Money
for Offices, were under a Disability,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55952:16"/>
or Incapacity of any for the future;
and the <hi>Mercatores Potestatum</hi> were
Infamous by their Laws.<note place="margin">Lamprid. <hi>in</hi> Alex. Sever. Arist. Pol. <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>Aristotle</hi>
thought it a matter of very ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to any Government to
have any thing of Money given for
Offices: because it taught men to
set a greater value on Money than
Vertue. These Considerations, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside the Story of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
were great enough to induce the
Christian Church to be extremely
Nice and Tender in this matter of
Benefices: and not only to forbid
the direct Sale of them for Money;
but any indirect Trafficking which
might take of the entire Freedom
of the Presentation of Persons to
them. I know to how little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it would be, to reckon up all
the Canons which have been made
in the Christian Church from the
Apostles Times downwards against
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55952:17"/>
               <hi>Simony:</hi> because some will say,
<hi>That the Ecclesiasticks were always true
to their own Interest.</hi> But let us set
aside all Prejudice in this matter, and
consider it Impartially. If any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in the World ought to be free
from the Suspicion of <hi>Sordid Traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
certainly those of the Church
ought, from the Nature and Design
of their Imployments. The Question
then will come to this, Whether gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Bond of Resignation in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Procuring a Benefice, be
such a Trafficking or not? And we
have three Rules to Judge by:</p>
            <p>1. The Nature and Reason of
the thing: whether such Actings be
not inconsistent with that Freedom,
which ought to be used, both in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and Taking Ecclesiastical Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices?
So that, if there were no
Laws either Ecclesiastical or Civil
in the Case; whether there be not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55952:17"/>
something in these Transactions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
the Design and Dignity
of the Employment?</p>
            <p>2. The Ecclesiastical Law of
<hi>England;</hi> which hath been from time
to time receiv'd here and allow'd by
a general Consent; and still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
in Force, where it is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to any Laws of the Realm:
which cannot be pretended in this
Case.</p>
            <p>3. The Statute Law; which doth
not abrogate the Ecclesiastical Law
as to <hi>Simony:</hi> it only Enacts some
particular Penalties on some more
Remarkable Simoniacal Acts, as to
Benefices and Orders; but never
once goes about to Repeal any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Laws about Simony, or
to determin the Nature and Bounds
of it.</p>
            <p>[2.] But let us come more closely
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55952:18"/>
to the Statute it self; to see whether
these Bonds of Resignation be not
against the Design of it. The
Words are, <hi>If any Person for any
Summ of Money, Reward, Gift, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or Benefit, directly or indirectly;
or for or by reason of any Promise, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
Grant, Bond, Covenant, or
other Assurance of or for any Summ of
Money, Gift or Profit whatsoever, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or indirectly; shall Present</hi> &amp;c.
Now we suppose a Patron to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
one to a Benefice, without any
Money, or Bond for Money; but
he declares before his Presenting
him, that he must enter into a Bond
to Resign his Benefice upon six
months Notice under a severe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty:
to which he submits, on the
Condition of obtaining his Benefice.
After this, the Patron demands such
a Portion of Tythes; or a Consent
for him to Inclose, to the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55952:18"/>
Benefit of the Patron, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of the Profits of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
The Question is, Whether such
a Bond be within the Design of this
Statute? All that can be said is,
that no such Consideration is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Bond, which is in General
Terms: which implies, that if the
Consideration had been Expressed
in the Bond, it had been plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law. But suppose it be
left out of the Bond: is not the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Summ of the Forfeiture of the
Bond sufficient to make the poor
Incumbent comply with the Terms
proposed afterwards? If none but
just and reasonable things had been
intended; why were they not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed in the Bond it self, so as
to prevent any Fear or Jealousy of
worse Designs? Have no such
things ever been practised, or heard
of among us? If there had not;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55952:19"/>
doth it not look like a Contrivance
to Deceive the Law, and to ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the Consciences of those who
take Benefices? And whatever is
done <hi>in Fraudem Legis,</hi> is against
Law: for it frustrates the main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and Design of a Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breaking the Letter of it; which
is the worst way of defeating a
Law.</p>
            <p>But we are told, <hi>That our Courts
of Law are to judge according to the
Law; and not according to an Equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Construction of the Intention and
Design of it.</hi> If it be really so; it
doth only shew that such Courts
are under a strange Limitation,
which are tied up to the Letter of a
Law, against the main Scope and
principal End of it. But by the
Judges Oath 18 <hi>E. 3. n. 2. 20 E. 3.
n. l.</hi> they are bound <hi>to do Equal Law
and Execution of Right to all the King's
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55952:19"/>
Subjects</hi> &amp;c. What is here meant
by <hi>Equal Law?</hi> Is it to pursue the
Letter of the Law against the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Design of it?</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of <hi>Equity</hi> to
be consider'd among us;</p>
            <p>1. An <hi>Equity</hi> founded upon a
Reasonable Construction of Law,
according to the Intention of it:</p>
            <p>2. An <hi>Equity</hi> for which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law hath made no Provision;
as in Cases of <hi>Fraud, Accident</hi> and
<hi>Trust:</hi> which is the true Foundation
of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Equity</hi> in <hi>Chancery;</hi>
viz. to supply the Defects of our
Law in those Cases.</p>
            <p>The Question now is, Whether
the Judges at Common Law are so
tied up to the bare Letter of it, that
they cannot take-in such Cases,
which are according to the Reason
of a Law, but not within the Words
of it? And my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> allows
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55952:20"/>
this sort of <hi>Equity.</hi> For, saith he,
<hi>Equity is a Construction made by the
Iudges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Inst. 24. b.</note> 
               <hi>that Cases out of the Letter of
a Statute, yet being within the same
Mischief or Cause of making of the
same, shall be within the same Remedy
that That Statute provideth.</hi> These
are remarkable Words of this great
Oracle of the Law, and ought to be
well weighed and considered in all
such Cases as this. And he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
saith, that <hi>Equity is the Reason
of the Law, which weighs Cases accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their due Measures;</hi> and so gives
<hi>in paribus rationibus paria Iura &amp; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia.</hi>
If then these Bonds of Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
are within the Reason of this
Law, and tend to the same Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
they ought to have the same
Remedy: and it cannot be made
any just Plea for them, that they
are not within the Letter of the

               <hi>II. I now come to consider the</hi> Oath
<hi>against</hi> Simony, <hi>which every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
is bound to take; which
runs in these words:</hi> I, <hi>A. B.</hi> do swear
that I have made no Simoniacal Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Contract or Promise, directly or
indirectly, by my self or by any other, to
my Knowledge or with my Consent, to
any Person or Persons whatsoever, for
or concerning the procuring or obtaining
of the Rectory or Vicarage; nor will at
any time hereafter perform or satisfy
any such kind of Payment, Contract or
Promise, made by any other without my
Knowledge or Consent.</p>
            <p>Simony,<note place="margin">3. Inst. 156.</note> 
               <hi>saith my Lord</hi> Coke, is
the more odious, because it is ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Perjury; for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentee
is sworn to commit no Simony.</p>
            <p>Here are two things fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55952:21"/>
1. That the Oath is not meerly
against direct <hi>Simony;</hi> but against
any <hi>Simoniacal Contract</hi> for obtaining
a Benefice.</p>
            <p>2. That this Oath is not limited
to the Statute 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> nor made in
pursuance of it; but was in being
long before: and therefore must
have its Interpretation from the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Law,</hi> as it was here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
and not from the words of
the Statute, which do not mention
a <hi>Simoniacal Contract.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Noy 25.</note> We must then
enquire what was a <hi>Simoniacal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi>
by our <hi>Ecclesiastical Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Provincial Constitutions,<note place="margin">C. de jurejur. Present. stat.</note>
which were receiv'd as part of our
Law relating to Ecclesiastical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
there is one about an Oath to
be taken by every one presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Bishop: <hi>That for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Presentation he had neither
promised nor given any thing to him that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55952:21"/>
presented him; nec aliquam propter hoc
inierit pactionem; nor enter'd into any
Bond or Covenant for that end:</hi> not
a Covenant, to pay a Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but to obtain the Presentation.
<hi>Propter hoc,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lyndw. f. 56.</note> saith <hi>Lyndwood, sc. ut
praesentetur:</hi> and he declares it before,
that whatever is done with an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to induce the Patron to present,
is <hi>Simoniacal;</hi> and whatever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
any enter into for that purpose,
is a <hi>Simoniacal Contract.</hi> Nay he
goes so far as to say, the doing Any
thing with that Design to obtain a
Benefice makes it a <hi>Mental Simony:</hi>
(which reaches not to the Oath, and
requires no more but Repentance)
but if there be a Bargain between
the Patron and the Party to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
he declares it to be a <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
Contract.</hi> He puts the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
If a Person offers to serve a
Patron for a Year or two, with that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55952:22"/>
Intention to obtain the Presentation
to such a Benefice by it, Whether
such a one can with a safe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
take the Oath? He answers
Negatively, If this were his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Design, and there were a Bond
or Covenant between them to that
purpose: for this were <hi>Simony.</hi>
From whence it follows; that any
Bond or Covenant enter'd into for
that End, to obtain a Presentation,
was <hi>Simoniacal</hi> according to the sense
of our Law Ecclesiastical.</p>
            <p>In the time of Archbishop <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
the Form of the Oath was more
full and express, as it is extant in the
Archbishop's Register called <hi>Morton,</hi>
and in <hi>Spelman's Councils:</hi> for there
is this Clause added, <hi>That neither
themselves nor any Friends of theirs are
under any Bonds about the Resignation
or Exchange of their Benefices.</hi> Here
the Oath is express against <hi>any Bonds
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55952:22"/>
of Resignation.</hi> But why is this
Clause left out since? Because it
was supposed to be sufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in the other Words: since this
was at least an indirect <hi>Simoniacal
Contract.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be said, <q>That Men
are not now tied up to the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
Opinions about <hi>Mental</hi> and
<hi>Conventional Simony:</hi> for out Law
owns nothing but <hi>real Simony;</hi>
i. e. either Actual Payment, or a
Bond to pay such a Summ of
Money to obtain a Presentation:
and if there be no Contract for
that End, it is no <hi>Simoniacal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi>
according to our Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is all that can be said in this
Case: but I think it can give no
considering Man satisfaction. For
the Intention of the Law, in being
so strict and severe against all <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
Contracts,</hi> was twofold:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55952:23"/>
1. To preserve the Dignity of
the Sacred Function; which could
never be upheld, if mean and sordid
Trafficking were allowed as to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices.
For the People can never
have any due Respect or Veneration
for a Person, whom they suspect to
have come into his Place among
them by indirect Practises; although
it be not the Payment of so much
Money. For they have so much
Sense as to know, that what is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
by Money is as good as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
according to its proportion:
and if a Man gives a Bond to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
his Living upon Notice; they
know how much this abates of the
Value of it to him, when he holds
it on such a Precarious Title: and
that he gives so much to obtain the
Living, as it is of less Value to him,
than if he had it without any such
Bond. He that is forced by a Bond
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55952:23"/>
to resign his Benefice, must part
with what was really valuable to
him; as much as the Possession of it
for so many years, as he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
enjoy it, would come to: and
he that gives a Bond to that purpose
to obtain a Presentation, doth oblige
himself to give to the Patron so
much as that Interest can be valued
at. Is not a free unconditional In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in a Benefice really more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable,
than that which depends on
the Pleasure of another? If it be;
then he that gives a Bond of Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
doth give something really
valuable in Money, to obtain the
Presentation. And how can this be
excused from <hi>Simony?</hi> Yes; some
may say, <hi>Simony</hi> is only a frightfull
Word used by <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> to deter
people from making the best of their
own: whereas the true Notion of
<hi>Simony</hi> is only <hi>buying the Gifts of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55952:24"/>
Holy Ghost:</hi> but what Relation is
there between the <hi>Gifts of the Holy
Ghost</hi> and a <hi>Benefice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not think there are any so
weak, as to imagine <hi>the Gifts of the
Holy Ghost</hi> can be purchased with
Money given to Patrons: and if
they could, the Dealers in such Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
would not think them worth
their Money; which they could lay
out upon things of greater value to
them. But here lies the true state
of the Case. It hath been the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Charity of Princes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Persons of Estates, to make En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of Parochial Churches
for the Support and Incouragement
of those in Holy Orders to attend
upon the Service of God in them:
and the Law of the Land hath so
annexed the Spiritual Duty with the
Temporal Advantage, that no one
can be capable of the latter, that is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55952:24"/>
not obliged to the other. So that the
Right of Discharging a Spiritual
Trust and the Right of Enjoying the
Profits go together. But to prevent
the unspeakable mischief of Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Profits which are devoted to
such a Spiritual use, this hath been
called by the detestable Name of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:</hi>
and very severe Laws have
been made, not only against the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Money, but the using of
any indirect means to obtain a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.
Because such things do
lessen the Esteem of those who use
them; and not only thereby make
them more uncapable of doing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but expose the Sacred Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it self to Contempt.</p>
            <p>2. Another great End of these
Laws, is to keep the Clergy from
Oppression and Slavery. I am far
from going about to lessen the Just
and Legal Rights of Patrons; who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55952:25"/>
by our Laws enjoy some Privileges,
which are not allowed them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries, where the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Law is stricter than here in
<hi>England:</hi> as in the liberty of Selling
the Rights of Advowsons; their
Trial at Common Law; the six
Months for Patrons <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for
our right understanding the present
matter, it must be consider'd, as to
the Rights of Patrons, That it was
not an Original and Absolute Right
to dispose of Benefices as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
but a limited Trust reposed in
them, to put-in Fit Persons to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Duties of their Places.
It is very well known to all persons
who have looked into these matters,
that in the first Settlement of this
<hi>Church of England,</hi> the Bishops of the
several Dioceses had them under their
own immediate Care; and that
they had the Clergy living in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55952:25"/>
with them, whom they sent
abroad to several parts of their <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses,</hi>
as they saw occasion to Imploy
them: but that by Degrees, they
saw a necessity of fixing Presbyters
within such a Compass, to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Service of God among the
People that were the Inhabitants:
that these Precincts which are since
called <hi>Parishes,</hi> were at first much
larger, and cast into such Divisions
in each Diocese, as probably make
up the several <hi>Deaneries</hi> since: that
when Lords of Manors were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to build Churches for their own
Conveniencies, they found it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to make some Endowments, to
oblige those who officiated in their
Churches to a diligent Attendance:
that upon this, the several Bishops
were very well content to let those
Patrons have the Nomination of
Persons to those Churches; provided
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55952:26"/>
they were satisfied of the Fitness of
those Persons, and that it were not
deferred beyond such a limited time.
So that the Right of Patronage is
really but a limited Trust; and the
Bishops are still in Law the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Fitness of the Persons to be
Imployed in the several parts of their
Dioceses. But the Patrons never had
the Absolute Disposal of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
upon their own Terms; but
if they did not present Fit Persons
within the limited time, the Care of
the Places did return to the Bishop,
who was then bound to provide for
them.<note place="margin">2. Inst. 361.</note> Some pretend, <hi>That before the</hi>
Lateran <hi>Council, there was no time of
Lapse to the Bishop, if the Patron did
not Present: but that the Bishop was
to provide one to serve the Cure in the
mean time, and the Patron might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
when he would.</hi> But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a Mistake: however it be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55952:26"/>
by Persons of great Authority.
My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> cites <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi>
for it: but I can find nothing like it
in either of them. <hi>Bracton</hi> indeed
speaks of the time of Lapse by the
<hi>Council of Lateran,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bract. l. 4. 341.</note> which was to be
<hi>after six Months,</hi> if a Dispute hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
about the Title; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
is extant in the <hi>Decretals:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ext. de Jure Patron. c. 22.</note>
and the same Words are used by
<hi>Fleta:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fleta l. 5. c. 14.</note> but not a Word in either of
them of any <hi>unlimited Power which
Patrons had before,</hi> as far as I can
find. Which made me wonder at
such a <hi>Maxim,</hi> as I find by several
father'd on <hi>Bracton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Selden <hi>of Tythes,</hi> c. 12. 389.</note> 
               <hi>Ante Concilium
Lateranense nullum currebat tempus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
Praesentantes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Abridgment 2. 354.</note> But <hi>Rolls</hi> very
fairly reports it just as it is in <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi>
yet afterwards he recites Mr.
<hi>Selden's</hi> words.<note place="margin">Ext. de Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio Jud. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. c. 4.</note> Before this <hi>Lateran
Council, Alex.</hi> had sent a Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hither, which allow'd the Bishops,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55952:27"/>
in case any Difference happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Patronage, to sequester the
Profits, without fixing the Time:
which is all the Foundation I can
meet with for this famous <hi>Maxim.</hi>
But before this we may observe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Canons of Councils,<note place="margin">Eugen. 2. in Synod. Rom. c. 24.</note> which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
the Patrons to <hi>three Months.</hi>
These Canons were never receiv'd
in <hi>England;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leo 4. in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Rom. c. 25. ed. Holst.</note> which, if I mistake not,
had always the privilege of <hi>six
Months</hi> for <hi>Patrons.</hi> This I ground
upon the <hi>Register,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Registr. f. 42.</note> a Book of great
Authority, and considerable Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
where it is said expresly, <hi>That
the Bishops have not the Right of Lapse
till six Months are passed;</hi> which is
said to be <hi>Secundum legem &amp; Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudinem
Regni Angliae; according to
the ancient Custom and Law of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
And the like was observed in
the old Customs of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cust. Norm. Art. 69.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55952:27"/>
But by the Ancient Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
notwithstanding the <hi>Right</hi> of
<hi>Patronage,</hi> the Bishop of the <hi>Diocese</hi>
had these Rights reserved to him:</p>
            <p>1. The Right of <hi>Admission</hi> of the
Person presented:</p>
            <p>2. The Right of <hi>Lapse,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
the Benefice, if the Patron
failed his six Months:</p>
            <p>3. The Right of making an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance,</hi>
by <hi>Deprivation</hi> or <hi>Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Bishop hath by the Law
the <hi>Right of Admission</hi> of the Person
presented by the <hi>Patron.</hi> For here
from the time of Christianity being
receiv'd among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> at least
as far as we can trace any Footsteps
of the Settlement of a <hi>Parochial Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
it was expresly provided for;
<hi>That no Presbyters should be fixed in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55952:28"/>
any Places, without the Consent of the
Bishop.</hi> For this we have a Canon
of <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
preserved by <hi>Egbert</hi> Archbishop
of <hi>York</hi> (each the Seventh in their
Sees, but at some distance of time)
in his Collection of <hi>Canons:</hi> the
words are,<note place="margin">pelm. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il.</note> 
               <hi>Statutum est ut sine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate
&amp; Consensu Episcoporum,
Presbyteri in quibuslibet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ecclesiis non
constituantur, nec inde expellantur; &amp;
siquis hoc facere tentaverit, Synodali
Sententiâ feriatur.</hi> So that by the
Original Constitution of this Church
the Bishops had the Power of Fixing
Presbyters in Churches, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
them if there were occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and no other Persons could do
it without them. This doth by no
means infringe the Right of Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or Presentation of Fit Persons
to the Bishop: but it implies that
no such Presentation was sufficient,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55952:28"/>
unless the Bishop did first Approve
and Consent to the Person. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Ancient Right of Patronage
here in <hi>England</hi> did consist, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have a better Account; than from
the Words of all the Nobility of
<hi>England</hi> in their Remonstrance to
<hi>Gregory</hi> IX. when he attempted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon them by Papal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
<note place="margin">Matt. Paris. A. D. 1239. p. 513.</note>

are words of great Weight; and
do plainly shew, that the Right of
Patronage consisted in the Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fit Persons to the Bishop of
the Diocese for any vacant Places:
but that the Bishops were, if they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55952:29"/>
approved them, to put them into

               <hi>that the Nobility and Bishops of</hi>

by the Ancient Custom, to build Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
on their own Lands: and the Pope
yielded it to the Laity, provided that
they had the Consent of the Bishop of
the Diocese; and that the Rights of
former Churches were not prejudiced

this Letter of the Nobility to the

of their Rights of Patronage, and

Person to the Bishop of the Diocese:

it was the Original and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Law of the <hi>English Church;</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55952:30"/>
as Ancient as the Right of <hi>Patronage.</hi>
In the same Epistle, they desire the
Pope to leave them to their ancient
Liberty, which was <hi>Personas ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas
praesentare.</hi> But who is to be
Judge of the <hi>Fitness of the Persons?</hi>
For that, we have a full Declaration
of the Ancient Law and Custom of
<hi>England, in Artic. Cleri, c. 13. De
Idoneitate Personae praesentatae ad Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium
Ecclesiasticum, pertinet Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio

Upon which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith,<note place="margin">2. Inst. 632.</note>
               <hi>That the Examination of the Ability and
Sufficiency of the Person belongs to the
Bishop, who is the Ecclesiastical Iudge;
and in this Examination he is a Iudge
and not a Minister; and may and ought
to refuse the Person presented, if he be
not Persona idonea.</hi> And that this was
no new Law, appears by the words,
<hi>That it had been hitherto so used, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55952:30"/>
should be so for the time to come.</hi> And
so <hi>Coke</hi> truly saith, that <hi>this Act was
but a Declaration of the Common Law
and Custom of the Realm.</hi> So that
the Bishops Power of <hi>Examining and
Iudging the Fitness of the Person pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented</hi>
is a part of the <hi>Common Law
of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>15 H. 7. 8. <hi>It is declared by all
the Judges,</hi> That the Bishop in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of a Clerk, is a Iudge and

himself, he is to be punished as a Iudge.</p>
            <p>18 H. 7. Keilway <hi>saith,</hi> That the
Bishop may refuse for Insufficiency; and
is to give notice to the Patron.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was Resolved by the Court in</hi>
Specot'<hi>s Case,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5 R. 57.</note> That the Court is to
give Credit to the Bishop acting Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:
<hi>but then it is said,</hi> That the
Plea must be special and certain.</p>
            <p>And so <hi>Coke</hi> saith, that in a <hi>Quare
Impedit</hi> brought against the Bishop
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55952:31"/>
for Refusal of his Clerk, <hi>he must
shew the Cause of his Refusal specially
and directly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was the Opinion of Lord
Chief Justice <hi>Anderson,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anders. 190. Leon. 3. 200.</note> 
               <hi>That in things
not Triable at Common Law a General
Plea was sufficient.</hi> But when the
Case came to the King's Bench
32 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was there said, That the
<hi>Articuli Cleri</hi> mention a <hi>Reasonable
Cause;</hi> which, say they, must be
Special: for <hi>Causa vaga &amp; incerta
non est rationabilis.</hi> But the main
point is, Who is to judge what is a
<hi>Reasonable Cause?</hi> and I cannot but
think that <hi>Anderson</hi>'s Opinion is the
truest and most Reasonable. If it
be for a matter Triable at Common
Law, that Court is to judge: but
if not, I do not see how it can be
avoided, but the Bishop must judge:
and his Judgment of <hi>Insufficiency</hi>
must be taken; as well as in any
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55952:31"/>
Certificate whatsoever. For, if the
Law trust him with the Judgment
of a Matter proper for him to judge
of; other courts, which have no
Cognizance of it, must give credit
to such a Certificate: or else they
must take upon them to judge in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that are not of their Cognisance;
which is to confound the Jurisdiction
of Courts. I grant, the Judgment of
the Bishop is not Conclusive: but
the Appeal then lies to the Supreme
Ecclesiastical Court; and the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi>
is to be Judge of the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of the Person.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But is not this a great Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to the Right of Patrons, if
the Bishops are to judge of the
Fitness of Persons presented; and
so the Patrons Presentation may
signify nothing, if the Bishop
pleases?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:55952:32"/>
This is a Trust which the Law
reposes in the Bishop, and it lies
upon his Conscience to act sincerely
in this matter: and in case of <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Fit Persons,</hi> a Trust must
be placed somewhere: and in whom
more properly than in the Bishop of
the Diocese? to whom the Care of
it doth especially belong; and that
by as plain Law as any we have.
Are not all Judges trusted in Matters
that come before them? But this is
no Decisive Judgment: for an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
lies according to the Nature of
the Matter. And this is no other
Trust than hath been allow'd in all
other Christian Nations, where the
Rights of Patronage are owned. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>

our own Law, but the General
Consent of the Christian World,
where the <hi>Right of Patronage</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd;
as to the Bishops Right of
<hi>Examining</hi> and <hi>Iudging the Fitness</hi> of
Persons presented to Benefices.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Collation</hi> upon
<hi>Lapse</hi> belongs to the Bishop, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Patronage.</hi>
It is said by Lord <hi>Hobart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hob. 154.</note> 
               <hi>That a
Lapse is not an Interest naturally, but a
meer Trust in Law;</hi> and afterwards;
<hi>That the Ordinary, or he that is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
by Lapse, is as a kind of Attourney
made by Law, to do that for the Patron;
which it is supposed he would do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if there were not some lett: and
therefore the Collation by Lapse is in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55952:33"/>
Right of the Patron and for his Turn.</hi>
This seems to me to be a mistaken
Notion of a <hi>Lapse:</hi> for the true
Question is, Whether upon a <hi>Lapse</hi>
the Ordinary doth collate <hi>Iure ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
or <hi>Iure devoluto?</hi> Some French
Lawyers held the latter;<note place="margin">De Roye de Jure Patr. p. 95. 145.</note> but <hi>Car.
Molinaeus</hi> and others utterly reject
that Opinion, for this Reason; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Dioceses</hi> were <hi>Iure
communi</hi> under the Care of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
but it was by <hi>particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi>
that the <hi>Patrons</hi> had the
Right of Presentation: which being
neglected, things do return to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Right:</hi> and therefore the Bishop
hath a true Interest, and acts not in
the Right of the Patron, but his Own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It's true, there is a</hi> Devolution <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by our Law: for as the
Author of the</hi> Doctor and Student
<hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. &amp; Stud. c. 36. 125.</note> The Law of the Realm is, that
if a Benefice falls void, then the Patron
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55952:34"/>
shall present within six Months; and if
he do not, that then the Ordinary shall
present: but yet the Law is farther in
this Case, that if the Patron present
before the Ordinary put-in his Clerk,
that then the Patron shall enjoy his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment:
and so it is, though the time
should fall to the Metropolitan. For,
<hi>as he saith,</hi> by our Law, if the Bishop
doth not collate within six Months, then
the Metropolitan presents. <hi>But this is
by a Right of</hi> Devolution, <hi>and then
why not the other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Answer is, That the Bishop
is <hi>Ordinary</hi> of the <hi>Diocese,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it comes to him of <hi>Common
Right:</hi> but it falls to the Archbishop,
not as <hi>Ordinary,</hi> but as <hi>Superiour;</hi>
to whom the <hi>Right of Devolution</hi>
falls upon the <hi>Inferiour</hi>'s Neglect.
For, although in some respects,
and in the Excepted Cases, the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
may be said to be <hi>Ordinary of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55952:34"/>
the whole Province:</hi> yet that is not so
much in respect of <hi>Immediate Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hob. 17. Brownl. 21. 27.</note> which <hi>Hobart</hi> and others
say, was <hi>by virtue of the Legatine
Power which was annexed to his See.</hi>
But the Archbishop hath a Power
as <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> to supply the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the <hi>Suffragans</hi> of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
and so this <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>collating</hi>
upon defect of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> comes
to him by <hi>Right of Devolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how then comes the King to his
Right after the Metropolitan's Neglect?</hi>
That is,<note place="margin">Dr. &amp; Stud. 124.</note> say our Lawyers, <hi>Because the
King is Patron Paramount of all the
Benefices within the Realm.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plowd. Com. 498. b.</note> The
meaning is, That the King by
Right of his Crown is to see that all
Places be duely supplied with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
fit for them: and if all others
whom the Law hath entrusted, do
neglect their Duties; then by the
natural Order and Course of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55952:35"/>
it falls to the Supreme
Power, which is to supply De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and to reform Abuses.</p>
            <p>3. The Bishop hath the Right of
making an Avoidance by Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Resignation. For, as he
hath the Power of putting-in; so the
Law hath lodged in him the Judicial
Power of proceeding against Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and hath not left that to the
Judgment of the Patron. If we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
Who by our Law is made the
proper Judge of a Beneficed Person,
whether he behaves himself so as to
deserve to lose his Benefice? Will
any one say, that the Law hath put
this into the Patron's hands? Yet
all those who justify these Bonds of
Resignation must in Effect say,
that the Patrons are the proper Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
for they have the real Power
of Deprivation in their Hands, and
may execute it when they please.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55952:35"/>
Which is such an Arbitrary Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as would be thought intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in other Hands.</p>
            <p>In all Causes of <hi>Deprivation</hi> of a
Person actually possessed of a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
these things must concur:</p>
            <p>1. A Monition or Citation of
the Party to Appear:</p>
            <p>2. A Charge given him, to which
he is to Answer, called the <hi>Libel:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A Competent Time assigned
for the Proofs and Answers:</p>
            <p>4. A Liberty for Counsel to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Cause; and to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Proofs and Witnesses:</p>
            <p>5. A Solemn Sentence after hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Proofs and Answers.</p>
            <p>These are the Fundamentals of
all Judicial Proceedings in the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Courts,</hi> in order to a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation:</hi>
and if these things be not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55952:36"/>
observed, the Party hath just cause
of Appeal, and may have Remedy
by a Superiour Court. And these
Proceedings are agreeable to the
Common Justice and Reason of
Mankind: because the Party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hath the liberty of Defence, and
the Right of Appeal. But there is
nothing of all this, in Bonds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation:
for the Patron takes the
Advantage of the Forfeiture of the
Bond; and so without any Trial,
or Proof, or Sentence, deprives him
of his Benefice.</p>
            <p>Some who are no Friends to the
Ecclesiastical Courts, would have
<hi>no Deprivation of a Benefice, but by
Proceedings at Common Law: because
it is a Freehold.</hi> Suppose that it were
so (which seems contrary to the
course of the Law: for the Bishop
in a Plea to a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> saith,
<hi>Nihil clamat praeter Institutionem &amp;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55952:36"/>
Destitutionem Clericorum;</hi> and <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Deprivations</hi> have been still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
at Common Law, if they
have been according to the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Laws) but taking it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that a Deprivation of a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
ought to be at Common Law:
what then? what, without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
and without a Trial by
a Jury? No Hearing of the Cause,
no Witnesses examin'd, no Counsel
to be heard, no Judgment by his
Peers? And can this be agreeable
to the Fundamental Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
to have Men forced out of
their <hi>Freeholds</hi> in such an Arbitrary
manner? What would they think;
if other <hi>Freehold Estates,</hi> which hold
of a Superiour Lord, were made so
Arbitrary, as to Depend upon the
Will of the Lord so, as to be turned
out upon six Months notice? Let
us see <hi>Bonds</hi> of <hi>Resignation</hi> practised
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55952:37"/>
upon such Estates: and then we
shall soon find, what Clamours will
be made against them, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the Fundamental Rights
and Liberties of the People. Is
there not the same Reason in this
Case? Is there not greater? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these Benefices are not Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
which are held of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons;
but they have only a Right
to Present Fit persons to them. But
it may be, that the Defenders of
these Bonds will deny Benefices to be
<hi>Freeholds</hi> by the Law of <hi>England.</hi> It
is easy to guess, what some Men
would have them to be, by these
<hi>Bonds:</hi> I am sure far enough from
<hi>Freeholds.</hi> But such private Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions
cannot alter the Nature of
things: and we are now enquiring,
What Benefices are, by the Law of
<hi>England?</hi> It is disputed at Common
Law, In whom the Freehold of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55952:37"/>
Glebeland of a Benefice is,<note place="margin">1. Inst. 341.</note> during
the Voidance? And it is agreed, that
it is neither in the Patron nor Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary:
because it was given to the
Incumbents and their Successors.
And therefore they tell us, it is then <hi>in
Abeyance;</hi> which is a pretty way of
expressing, That the Law takes care
that it shall come to the next In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent,
notwithstanding the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance
by Death of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor:
and I think it had been as
well said, that it was in the Law,
although not in any Person. But it is
not disputed, but that as soon as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Incumbent is in Possession, the
<hi>Freehold</hi> is in Him: for those are <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton</hi>'s
words, Sect. 647. And my
Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith, <hi>That the Incumbent
cannot be look'd on, as a meer Tenant
for Life: because he may have such
Writs, which none can have but a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in Fee-simple or Fee-tail; and he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55952:38"/>
may receive homage, which Tenant for
Life cannot do.</hi> And for this he goes
as far back as the time of <hi>E.</hi> 1. But
long before that, in <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s time,
which was of <hi>H.</hi> 2. it is said,<note place="margin">Glanvil l. 13. c. 20.</note> 
               <hi>That
he that is possessed of a Benefice by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
from the Bishop, and judged
fit by Him, shall enjoy it for his Life;
although the Right of Advowson be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</hi>
Which is several times affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> upon good
Reason. In one place he saith,
<hi>That at the Common Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Inst. 343. b.</note> 
               <hi>if a Church
be once full, the Incumbent could not be
removed:</hi> (excepting Just Cause of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation)
<hi>and Plenarty generally
was a good Plea in a</hi> Quare Impedit,
<hi>or Assise of</hi> Darein Presentment: <hi>and
the Reason of this was, to the Intent
the Incumbent might apply himself to his
Spiritual Charge. 2. The Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that the Bishop that had
Cure of Souls within his Diocese
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55952:38"/>
would admit and institute an able
Man for the Discharge of his Duty
and his own; and that the Bishop
would do right to every Patron in
his Diocese.</hi> In another place he
saith,<note place="margin">2. Inst. 357.</note> 
               <hi>That by the order of Common
Law, if one had presented unto a Church
whereto he had no Right, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
had admitted and instituted his
Clerk, this Incumbent could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
for divers Reasons: 1. For that
he came into the Church by a Iudicial
Act of the Bishop. 2. That by the
Common Law, in every Town and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
there ought to be</hi> Persona idonea:
<hi>and when the Bishop had admitted him
able, which implied that he was</hi> idonea
Persona, <hi>then the Law had his final
Intention,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Church should
be sufficiently provided for. 3. That
the Incumbent having</hi> Curam anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<hi>might the more effectually and
peaceably intend so great Charge;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55952:39"/>
the Common Law provided, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Institution he should not be subject
to any Action, to be removed at the Suit
of any common Person; without all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Age, Coverture, Imprisonment,
or</hi> Non-sane-memory; <hi>and without
regard of Title, either by Descent or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
or of any Estate.</hi> Are these
things consistent with <hi>Bonds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be said,</hi> That here is
no Deprivation supposed, but a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Resignation: and what hurt is
there, if it be a Man's own Act?</p>
            <p>I answer, that we are not only
to consider the Act of the Person,
but the Interest and general Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church in it. For in
all matters of such a Publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we are not to regard so much
the Consent of the Party, as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Consequence of the Act it
self. If it be an illegal thing, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55952:39"/>
tend to subvert the Rights of the
Church; it cannot make it legal to
say, that it was his own Act. Now
as to this kind of Resignation, we
are to consider these two things:</p>
            <p>1. That if the Resignation be not
into the hands of the Bishop, it is
an illegal Act, and void of it self:</p>
            <p>2. That if it be into the Bishop's
hands, he hath the Power in Law to
Accept it or not.</p>
            <p>1. That the Resignation must be
into the hands of the Bishop. For
a Resignation into the hands of the
Patron, is by the <hi>Canon Law</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be null and void of it self.
So <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. <hi>ad c. 6. de rerum
per.</hi> And this is grounded on the
Text of the <hi>Canon Law.</hi> C. 17.
Q. 2. c. <hi>Gonsaldus:</hi> and on the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix

where it is declared <hi>to be an unworthy

is confirmed by <hi>Innocent</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 8.
in the <hi>Decretals.</hi> But we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
especially, how far this part of
the Canon Law was here receiv'd;
and we can have no better a Judge
in this Case than <hi>Lyndwood,</hi> who
saith positively,<note place="margin">Lyndw. f. 55. c. <hi>Ne lepra.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Renuntiatio fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

i. e. a Resignation made into
the hands of a <hi>Lay-Patron,</hi> if it be
never so free, doth not hold: and
therefore he saith, it must be made
into the hands of Him who hath the
<hi>Ordinary Iurisdiction,</hi> and therefore
hath power to Admit.</p>
            <p>He observes two things very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
as to the point of Resignation:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:55952:40"/>
1. That a Voluntary Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though not to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
the Party of the Possession; so
as he cannot recover, although he
be not wholly devested of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
or Right to the thing: <hi>Quia
sine Consensu Superioris non tenet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signatio:</hi>
and this is founded on that
Fundamental Reason, That the Care
of the Diocese belongs to him, who
hath the Ordinary Jurisdiction; who
was the Bishop: but as <hi>Lyndwood</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
<hi>by Custom and Composition,</hi>
this is put into other hands; as in
Places of Exempt Jurisdiction. And
so, where the Power of granting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
is lodged by the <hi>Bishop's
Consent,</hi> and a <hi>Prescription</hi> upon it;
there is a Power likewise of Receiving
a <hi>Resignation:</hi> but not in any, who
have only a Delegated Power from
the Bishop. For there is a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in Law and Reason between
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55952:41"/>
an <hi>Ordinary Power</hi> depending on an
ancient <hi>Prescription</hi> and <hi>Composition</hi>
(as it is in several places in the <hi>Deans</hi>
and <hi>Chapters</hi> within certain Precincts)
and an <hi>Ordinary Power</hi> in a <hi>Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi>
as a <hi>Chancellor</hi> or <hi>Vicar-General.</hi>
For although such an Officer hath
the same Court with the Bishop,<note place="margin">6. de Appel. c. Roman. Lyndw. f. 54.</note> so
that the Legal Acts of the Court are
the Bishop's Acts, by whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he sits there; so that no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
lies from the Bishop's Officer
to himself, but to the Superiour:
and although a <hi>Commissary</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to have the Power of the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
in <hi>Testamentary Causes,</hi> which were
not originally of <hi>Spiritual Iurisdiction,</hi>
as it is said in <hi>Henslow</hi>'s Case,<note place="margin">9 R. 41. De Testam. v. Stat. v. Approbat.</note> with
which <hi>Lindwood</hi> agrees: yet in Acts
of Spiritual and Voluntary <hi>Iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
the Case is otherwise. For the
Bishop by Appointing a <hi>Chancellor,</hi>
doth not devest himself of his own
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55952:41"/>
               <hi>Ordinary Power:</hi> but he may dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
some parts of it by <hi>Commission</hi> to
others, which goes no farther than
is expressed in it. For it is a very
great Mistake in any to think, that
such who act by a <hi>Delegated Power,</hi>
can have any more Power than is
given to them; where a <hi>Special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
is required for the Exercise of
it.<note place="margin">6. De Ossicio Vicarii c. 2.</note> For by the <hi>General Commission</hi> no
other Authority passes, but that of
<hi>hearing Causes:</hi> but all Acts of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Jurisdiction require a <hi>Special
Commission,</hi> which the Bishop may
restrain as he sees Cause. For as
<hi>Lyndwood</hi> saith, <hi>Nothing passes,</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Officii, <hi>but the Hearing of Causes:</hi>
so that other Acts depend upon the
Bishop's particular Grant for that
purpose. And the Law no-where
determins the bounds of a <hi>Chancellor's
Power</hi> as to such Acts; nor can it
be supposed so to do, since it is but a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55952:42"/>
               <hi>delegated Power:</hi> and it is in the
Right of him that Deputes, to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribe
and Limit it. Neither
can <hi>Use or Custom</hi> inlarge such a
Power, which depends upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Will. And however, by
modern Practise, the Patents for
such Places have passed for the Life
of the Person, to whom they were
first granted; yet it was not so, by
the ancient <hi>Ecclesiastical Law of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
<note place="margin">De Sequestr. v. Officiales.</note> For <hi>Lyndwood</hi> affirms, That
a Grant of Jurisdiction ceases by the
Death of him who gave it: <hi>Per
Mortem deputantis cessat Potestas Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialium:</hi>
(or else it could never pass
into the Dean and Chapter <hi>sede va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante;</hi>
or to the Guardian of the
Spiritualties.) And he gives a good
Reason for it; <hi>Nè invitus habeat Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficialem
sibi fortassis odiosum.</hi> It's true,
that by the Statute 37 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 17.
meer Doctors of Law are made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55952:42"/>
of Exercising <hi>all manner of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Iurisdiction.</hi> But it doth
not assign the Extent of their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
but leaves it to the Bishops
themselves, from whom their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is derived. And the Law
still distinguishes between <hi>Potestas
Ordinaria</hi> and <hi>Delegata:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bracton l. 5. c. 2.</note> for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
supposes a Person to act in his
own Right and not by Deputation;<note place="margin">Fleta l. 6. c. 37. 1. Inst. 96. Cowel. v. Ordin.</note>
which, I suppose, no Chancellors
or Officials will pretend to. But
how far now, a Commission to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
Jurisdiction doth hold, when
the Person who gave it is dead, is
not my present business to enquire:
but in <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Case, it seems to be
taken for granted by the Counsel,
that a Chancellor's Patent,<note place="margin">Cr. Car. 65.</note> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Dean and Chapter, doth give
a Man a Freehold for Life, if he be
capable of doing his Duty; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he may be deprived for Insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55952:43"/>
as Doctor <hi>Sutton</hi> was.
But <hi>Noy</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Noy 91.</note> 
               <hi>That the Court was in
doubt, how far the Act of the Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
could bind the Successor as to the
Profits.</hi> And in the Prebend of <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherlies</hi>
Case,<note place="margin">152.</note> 
               <hi>Dodderidge</hi> declared,
<hi>That Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction in Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Acts may be executed by Substitute:
but a Grant of it is not good, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Bishop's Life; and shall not
bind the Successor.</hi> And <hi>Coke</hi> thought
it a very hard thing, <hi>That the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
should not remove him; but be
bound to answer for the Acts and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a Commissary, which he never
put-in.</hi> But these things belong not
to our present business, any farther
than to shew, that however in some
Cases the Bishops may substitute o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
yet as to <hi>Resignations</hi> of <hi>Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
for all that I can find, the Law
only takes notice of the <hi>Bishop</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55952:43"/>
               <hi>Lyndwood</hi> observes, that there is a
difference to be made between the
<hi>Resignation</hi> of a <hi>Simple Benefice,</hi> i. e.
where there is no Cure of Souls;
and of such a one that hath such a
Cure going along with it. In the
former Case he saith, <hi>That a Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
may be to the prejudice of the
Party, without the Bishop's Consent:</hi>
but in the latter, where it may be
<hi>to the prejudice of Others</hi> as well as of
himself, it hath no force without the
<hi>Bishop's Ratification: In hoc Casu ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria
est Ratihabitio Episcopi.</hi> So
that no <hi>Resignation</hi> of a <hi>Cure of Souls</hi>
can be of any Validity without the
<hi>Bishop's Acceptance.</hi> In the Case of
<hi>Smith</hi> against <hi>Foanes,</hi> it was resolved
and agreed by all upon Evidence at
Bar,<note place="margin">Noy 157.</note> 
               <hi>That a Resignation to a Proctor,
does not make the Church void, until it
be accepted by the Bishop, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:55952:44"/>
2. But suppose the <hi>Resignation</hi> be
made into the hands of the Bishop,
is he bound to <hi>Accept</hi> it? By what
Law? For what Reason? Must
he not enquire into the Reason and
Inducements of the <hi>Resignation,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be <hi>Corrupt</hi> or not? No <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
can be bound to accept a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Resignation;</hi> and whether it be
so or not, he is bound to enquire:
and if he be not satisfied; by what
Law can he be required to do that,
which he cannot do with a good
Conscience? If the Law hath trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with accepting a <hi>Resignation;</hi>
it hath likewise trusted him with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether it be fit to be accepted
or not. In <hi>Gayton</hi>'s Case it is plain,
<hi>That the Bishop may refuse a Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before a Publick Notary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wen 12.</note> 
               <hi>when
there was a Condition annexed to it,
which the Law doth not annex.</hi> For
in this Case, the Condition was,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55952:44"/>
               <hi>That if such or such a Person were not
presented within six Months, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
should be null:</hi> which <hi>Coke</hi>
then said, <hi>made it void,</hi> because <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signations
ought to be free:</hi> and this is
a Judicial Act, to which a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot be annexed, no more
than an Ordinary may admit upon
Condition.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that in
Case of <hi>Donatives</hi> the <hi>Resignation</hi>
must be into the Patrons hands, as in
<hi>Gays</hi> and <hi>Fairchild</hi>'s Case:<note place="margin">Yelvert. 60 Mar. 765.</note> why then
may not a <hi>Resignation</hi> be good to a
Patron in other Benefices, since
those are as really <hi>Benefices</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>The difference is, that there is no
<hi>Presentation</hi> to the Bishop in <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi>
For, it is agreed by the Judges
in that Case,<note place="margin">Cr. 2. 63.</note> 
               <hi>That if there were a
Presentation once made to the Bishop,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Inst. 344</note>
               <hi>it ceases to be a Donative, and becomes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55952:45"/>
always Presentable.</hi> So that the Case
of <hi>Donatives</hi> is very different; for
we say, that wherever the Bishop
hath a Right to admit, it is his Right
to accept of a <hi>Resignation.</hi> But in
this Case, the Bishop is supposed to
have nothing to do in the <hi>Admission</hi>
or <hi>Institution</hi> of the Person. If it be
asked, <hi>how the Bishops came to lose
their Right of receiving the Presentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to these Benefices?</hi> I answer, that
they seem to me to have come one
of these two ways: 1. <hi>By Royal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:</hi>
so my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith, <hi>That
the King may not only found a Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Inst. 344.</note>
               <hi>or Free Chapel Donative himself; but
may License any Subject to do the same.</hi>
But the <hi>Register</hi> supposes a <hi>Royal
Foundation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Registr. 40. 3.</note> and not a meer <hi>Royal
Licence;</hi> and that it must be proved
to be <hi>Ancient</hi> too: and therefore a
<hi>New Licence</hi> will not come up to the
<hi>Register. 2. By Peculiar Privilege.</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55952:45"/>
As when a Lord of a Manor in a
great Parish, having his Tenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him at a remote distance from
the Parish-Church, offers to build
and endow a Church there; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that it should belong entirely to
him and his Family, to put in such
Persons as they should think fit, if
they were in Holy Orders. It's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
possible, that the Bishops at that
time, to encourage such a Work,
might permit them to enjoy this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
which being continued <hi>time
out of mind,</hi> is turned into a <hi>Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
If these <hi>Donatives</hi> had been
common, the Mischief would have
been more visible: but being so
few in Comparison, they have been
less taken notice of. And they are
to be distinguished from those called
<hi>Sine-cures</hi> and <hi>Exempt Iurisdictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Sine-cures</hi> in Truth, are <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
Presentable;</hi> but by means of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55952:46"/>
               <hi>Vicarages</hi> endowed in the same pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Persons who enjoy them,
have by long Custom been excused
from Residence; which is the most
can be said for them. And such
<hi>Sine-cures,</hi> if they be resigned, it
must be into the Bishop's hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exempt Iurisdictions</hi> are not so
called, because under No <hi>Ordinary;</hi>
but because they are not under the
<hi>Ordinary</hi> of the <hi>Diocese,</hi> but have
one of their own. These are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Peculiars;</hi> and they are
of several sorts:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Royal Peculiars:</hi> which are the
<hi>King's Free Chapels,</hi> and are Exempt
from any Jurisdiction but the King's;
and therefore such may be <hi>Resigned</hi>
into the King's hands as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Ordinary;</hi>

               <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Case, it is not here a
place to examine.</p>
            <p>2. Archbishops Peculiars: <hi>which
are not only in the Neighbour.</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses,
<hi>but dispersed up and down in
remoter places: For it appears by</hi>
Eadmerus,<note place="margin">Eadm. Hist. in Anselm. p. 22.</note> That wherever the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
had an Estate belonging to him, he
had the sole Iurisdiction as Ordinary.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Deans and Chapters Peculiars:</hi>
which are Places wherein by <hi>Ancient
Compositions</hi> the Bishops have parted
with their <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> as <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> to
those Societies; whose Right was
not <hi>Original,</hi> but derived from the
Bishop;<note place="margin">Rolls Abrid. 2. 357.</note> and where the <hi>Compositions</hi>
are lost, it depends upon <hi>Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
as in the <hi>Deans and Chapters</hi> of
St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> which are
mentioned in the Books, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Peculiars</hi> belonging to <hi>Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
For, the richer <hi>Monasteries</hi> were
very uneasy, until they had obtained
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55952:47"/>
either from the <hi>Bishops,</hi> or from the
<hi>Popes</hi> (which proved the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
but more chargeable way)
an <hi>Exemption</hi> from Ordinary Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Those <hi>Churches,</hi> which the
<hi>Monasteries</hi> had gotten to be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to themselves, were called <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations:</hi>
but how far these were
Exempt from the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is not fully understood; and
therefore I shall endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Appropriations</hi> did not at first
imply any <hi>Exemption</hi> from the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi>
For it was expresly provided
in the Canon Law,<note place="margin">C. 16. Q. 2. c. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ane.</note> that no Persons
should be put into such Churches
without <hi>Institution from the Bishop:</hi>
to whom the <hi>Incumbents</hi> were to be
answerable in all <hi>Spiritual matters;</hi>
as in all <hi>Temporal,</hi> to the <hi>Abbots.</hi> And
in the oldest <hi>Appropriations,</hi> which I
have seen, there is a <hi>Salvo per omnia
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55952:47"/>
Iure Episcopali:</hi> which words are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with an <hi>Exemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Forms of <hi>Appropriation</hi>
were different afterwards. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
none could be made without
the Bishop's Consent, yet that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
was expressed in different ways,
and had different Effects.</p>
            <p>If the Bishop only confirmed the
Lay-Patron's Gift, then nothing but
the <hi>Right of Patronage</hi> passed, and
his Jurisdiction remained. If the
Bishop joyned in the <hi>Donation</hi> in
these words,<note place="margin">Ext. de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. c. Pastor</note> 
               <hi>Concedimus vobis talem
Ecclesiam;</hi> then he passed away his
<hi>Temporal Rights,</hi> as to that Church.
If the Bishop granted the Church
<hi>Pleno jure;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lyndw. f. 80</note> then the <hi>Canonists</hi> say, he
passed his <hi>Diocesan Right:</hi> which
consisted in Rights which the Bishop
had distinct from his <hi>Episcopal Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:</hi>
which it was thought he
could not part with by any Act of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55952:48"/>
his; for that were to devest himself
of his Order.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Appropriations,</hi> confirmed by
the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi> were allow'd to
carry with them <hi>Exemptions</hi> from
the <hi>Ordinary.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries</hi>
which could bear the charge,
did not think themselves free from
their <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> till they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Bulls</hi> for that purpose: and then
they took themselves to be free in
their <hi>Conventual Churches,</hi> as well as
their <hi>Chapels,</hi> or <hi>Oratories</hi> on their
own Lands.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>All</hi> Papal Exemptions <hi>are taken
away by Act of Parliament,</hi> 31 H. 8.
c. 13. <hi>and the</hi> Churches <hi>so exempted
are put under</hi> the Iurisdiction of the
Ordinary of the Diocese; or such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
as the King shall appoint. <hi>So
that no</hi> Papal Exemption <hi>can now
be pleaded, as to</hi> Appropriated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
<hi>how clear and full soever the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55952:48"/>
Charters of</hi> Exemption <hi>were. This
is a thing so little taken notice of,
that I shall set down the words,
Sect.</hi> 23. Be it further enacted, that
such of the said Monasteries &amp;c. and
all Churches and Chapels, to them, or
any of them belonging; which before the
Dissolution &amp;c. were exempted from
the Visitation or Visitations, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iurisdiction of the Ordinary or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries,
within whose Diocese they
were situate or set, shall from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be within the Iurisdiction and
Visitation of the Ordinary or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
within whose Diocese they or any
of them be situate and set; or within
the Visitation and Iurisdiction of such
Person or Persons, as by the King's
Highness shall be limited or appointed;
this Act, or any other Exemption, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
or Iurisdiction, to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55952:49"/>
Therefore no Persons who enjoy
the Estates belonging to <hi>Monasteries,</hi>
can now plead an <hi>Exemption</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
thereof from the <hi>Ordinaries Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi>
nor that they have a Power
to put-in and put-out as they please,
without any regard to the Bishop's
Authority.</p>
            <p>But suppose there were no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment,
and that the Churches
were built on the Site of the <hi>Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and so were supplied by their
own Body; then such Persons are
wholly at their Will, and they may
turn them out as they please. I
answer;</p>
            <p>I confess the Condition of such
Stipendiaries, is as bad as of those
who hold their Benefices under <hi>Bonds</hi>
of <hi>Resignation.</hi> For Tenures at the
Will of the Lord are the worst of any.
But it is to be hoped, that such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who enjoy such Estates as were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55952:49"/>
originally designed for the support
of the <hi>Parochial Clergy,</hi> (however at
first fraudulently perverted by the
Combination of the <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Popes)</hi> will at the least take Care
that the Cure of Souls be duely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for in such Places. For that
Burthen goes along with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Revenue in whose hands soever
it be: and so they are both in Law
and Conscience to see the Places
well supplied. And by the Statutes
of Dissolution, as they do enjoy the
Rights, so they are bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the Churches: and where
they were <hi>Parochial,</hi> to see that there
were a fixed Incumbent with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Maintenance; which the Law
always took a particular Care of.</p>
            <p>II. It is time now to consider
the <hi>Precedents,</hi> which have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to shew, that these <hi>Bonds of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55952:50"/>
Resignation</hi> are not against Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first is of</hi> Iones <hi>and</hi> Laurence,
8 Iac. <hi>A Bond was given to resign
the Benefice he was presented to,
within three Months upon Request:
and it was alledged in Court, that
it was a</hi> Simoniacal Contract,<note place="margin">Cr. 2. 248.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Law. <hi>On the other side it was
said,</hi> That there doth not appear any
Simony upon the Condition: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Iudgment was given for the Bond.
<hi>But a Writ of Error was brought
in the</hi> Exchequer Chamber: <hi>and the
principal Error insisted on was,</hi>
That this Condition was against Law.
<hi>But the Judges of the</hi> Common Bench
and Barons of the Exchequer <hi>held,</hi> That
the Obligation and Condition are good
enough. For a Man may bind himself
to resign upon good and valuable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
without any Colour of Simony:
as to be obliged to resign, in Case of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
or Non-Residence; or if his Son
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55952:50"/>
be at Age. But if it had been for a
Lease of the Glebe, or Tythes, or a
Summ of Money; That had been Simony
&amp;c. <hi>and so the Judgment was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Precedent, I answer, That
the Reason of the Judges is insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
For it comes to this: the Bond
is good because there may be good
Reason for it. May it not be said
on the other side, The Bond is
naught, because there may be a
very bad Reason for it? And a
Bond that may be turned to so very
ill Uses, it cannot but seem strange
to me, that the Judges should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it to be a good Bond. If the
particular Reasons had been made
the Conditions of the Bond, they
might have judged upon them: but
the Bond was general, and no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in it but Notice. Therefore
their Judgment must be, that a Bond
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55952:51"/>
is reasonable, if no bad Condition
appears in it: which makes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
a Slave to the Patron, and
overthrows the just Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Clergy; and lays them
open to Perjury, when they give
such a Bond meerly to obtain a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.
And they very well knew
that none could be possessed of a
Benefice without an Oath against all
<hi>Simoniacal Contracts, either directly or
indirectly.</hi> Why did not the Judges
declare, that it was <hi>Simony</hi> within
their Oath? <hi>But they were onely to
judge of the Law.</hi> And how could
they judge this not to be a <hi>Simonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Bargain? <hi>Because there was no
Simoniacal Condition in it.</hi> But what
is a <hi>Simoniacal Condition?</hi> Where hath
the Common Law determin'd it?
And by what Rule? Yes, say they,
<hi>A Lease for Tythes, or a Bargain for
Money, had been Simony.</hi> But how
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55952:51"/>
come they to determine that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Contracts are <hi>Simoniacal;</hi> when
they own, <hi>That Simony is not under
their Cognisance?</hi> Did they ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to advise with the <hi>Civilians,</hi> What
was a <hi>Simoniacal Contract,</hi> according
to the Ecclesiastical Law? Not the
least mention of this: and therefore
I cannot but think this a Judgment
without sufficient Reason to support
it.</p>
            <p>The same Cause came on again
the next Year: and there it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>That it was not Simony, but good
Policy to tie him to resign; and if it
were, it is not material.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cr. 2. 274.</note> Here are
two good Points declared: 1. <hi>That
Bonds of Resignation are good Policy.</hi>
To what End? To insnare Mens
Consciences; to make the Church
a Prey to corrupt Patrons; to keep
Men from doing their Duties, lest
they should displease their Patrons.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55952:52"/>
If this be <hi>good Policy,</hi> let it rather pass
for that, than for <hi>good Law. 2. That
it is not material as to the Goodness of the
Bond, whether it be Simony or not.</hi> Then
it seems a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Contract holds
good in Law: which I think was
no <hi>good Policy</hi> for Judges to declare.</p>
            <p>But we are told, That 15 <hi>Iac.</hi> in
the Case of <hi>Paschal</hi> and <hi>Clerk,</hi> it
was said by the Court upon Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

Judgment is not hitherto disproved,

The Court held, that if a Man entred into
a Contract to procure a Presentation in
Consideration of the Marriage of his Son,
that had been a Simoniacal Contract. <hi>Why
is not a</hi> Bond of Resignation, <hi>as much</hi>
Simony, <hi>as a Consideration of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
when both are made equally
the Conditions of obtaining a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation?</hi>
            </p>

yet in the one Case, a Man swears
with a good Conscience: which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55952:53"/>
I think he cannot in the other.</p>
            <p>In the Case of <hi>Winchcomb</hi> and <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leston,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hob. 165.</note> it was declared to be <hi>Simony,
to purchase the next Presentation, when
the Incumbent was still alive, but in a Fit
of the Strangury.</hi> And yet this was
not within the Letter of the Law:
for the Living was not actually void.
Therefore such Acts, as are against
the Design and Reason of the Law,
are forbidden by it. And the like

               <note place="margin">Wynch 63.</note> In

when any ill use is made of them.</hi> But
why should any such <hi>Bonds be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Law,</hi> which are liable to such
ill Uses?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I conclude with the Words of
my</hi> Lord Coke,<note place="margin">1. Inst. 17. b.</note> That the Common Law
doth detest Simony, and all corrupt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55952:53"/>
Bargains for Presentation to any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
and its design is, that a fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the Discharge of the Cure should
be presented freely without Expectation
of any thing. <hi>How then can</hi> Bonds
of Resignation <hi>be agreeable to Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus dispatched the main
Point against all <hi>General Bonds,</hi>
which are made the Conditions of
obtaining a Presentation; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
only some Quaere's to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
            <p>(1.) Suppose a <hi>Bond be required
onely to tie Men up to do their Duties,
and to keep them from Non-Residence.</hi>
I answer, (1.) That the Patron is
to blame to pitch upon a Person to
discharge such a Cure, of whom at
the same time he discovers such a
mistrust, as to need a Bond to
make him do his Duty. And if a
Man makes no Conscience of his
Duty without a Bond, I doubt he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55952:54"/>
will make very little with it. If he
could make him a good Man by
his Bond, it were of great Use; but
if he be not, he may do the more
Mischief by continuing in his Place
by the Force of a Bond. So that I
look on such Bonds, as apt to raise
Scruples in good Mens Minds; and
to do no good upon bad ones.</p>
            <p>2. That all wise and good
Patrons will consider the general
Mischief, more than a particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.
And what greater
Mischief can come to our Church,
than to have Bonds of Resignation
brought into Request? For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>corrupt Patrons as to Bargains;</hi>
what Advantage will <hi>corrupt Patrons
as to Religion</hi> make of it? who by
that Means will be able to turn out
the Incumbents upon Notice given,
when Opportunity serves them: as
is before observ'd in the Preface.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:55952:54"/>
(2.) <hi>Suppose</hi> it be a very equitable
Case, as for a Minor; is a Bond of
Resignation unlawfull?</p>
            <p>I answer, That there may be a
<hi>Lawfull Trust,</hi> in such a Case I do
not question: but whether the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who takes this <hi>Trust,</hi> can enter
into a Bond, and take the Oath, I
very much question, upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
already mention'd. For there
may be a <hi>confidential Simony,</hi> as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists</hi>
call it: and the way to prevent
it, is, say they, That the Trust be
<hi>sine pretii,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Navarr. Man. c. 23. n. 109.</note> 
               <hi>pacti, modi, vel conditionis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terventu.</hi>
For the taking of a Bond
argues a <hi>Mistrust;</hi> and is therefore
contrary to the Nature of a <hi>Trust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>Suppose</hi> the Bishop himself
requires a Bond of Resignation, as to a
Prebend of his Church, if the Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quit the Diocese; is such a Bond ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable,
or not?</p>
            <p>The Bishop, is no doubt, bound
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55952:55"/>
to take all possible care of the Good
of his Diocese, and to make his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
serviceable to that End.
But if a Man knows before-hand,
that without this Condition he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obtain it, and with it he may,
he runs into a Snare by giving a
Bond for that End; and after, taking
the Oath against any <hi>Simoniacal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
directly or indirectly.</hi> I do think
these Bonds of so bad a Nature and
Tendency, that I do wish, that no
Countenance or Incouragement be
given to them: especially by such,
whose Example may encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to do that for Bad Designs,
which they do for Good. And
Wise and Good Men will always
shew the greatest Regard to that,
which serves the most Publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and prevents the most grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mischief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55952:55"/>
(4.) <hi>Suppose</hi> the Incumbent of a
Living makes an Agreement with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Clergy man, that he shall have a
Lease of his Benefice from three Years to
three Years; upon which he takes a Summ
of Money, and gives a Bond of Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
before Harvest, and is to procure
a Presentation from the Patron: is this
Simony or not, by our Law?</p>
            <p>Here the Patron is onely suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
barely to know and to consent,
(which is hardly to be supposed in
such kind of Cases) and that the
Terms are onely between the two
Parties, (for I will not suppose the
Bishop accessary to such Bargains)
the Question is, Whether the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
can with a safe Conscience part
with his Benefice on such Terms?
and whether the other can give a
valuable Consideration for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in it, if the Patron consents?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:55952:56"/>
               <hi>I answer, That the Law is as
express against</hi> corrupt Resignations, as
against corrupt Bargains for a Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<hi>onely the Penalty is not so
great. The Words of the Act are,</hi>
That if any Incumbent of any Benefice
with Cure of Souls, shall corruptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or exchange the same, or corruptly
take for, or in respect of the Resigning
or Exchanging of the same directly or
indirectly, any Pension or Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or Benefit whatsoever; that then as
well the Giver as the Taker <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall
lose double the Value of the Money so
given, and double the Value of one years
Profit. 31 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>It may possibly be said, That
this is a distinct Clause from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and hath another kind of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty;
and so cannot reach Persons
in point of Conscience as the other
doth. But this is a strange way of
dealing with Laws. For there is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55952:56"/>
the same Penalty in the former
Clause; onely there is added a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Avoidence,</hi> and a <hi>disability in Law:</hi>
supposing these two left out, the
one stands upon the same Foot with
the other. And I would know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if these were gone, they could
not as well make a Bargain for a
Presentation, as for such a Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
And is there nothing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or Honour, or a Regard to
the Dignity of the Sacred Function
in the Case? No Reverence to Laws
made on purpose to deter Men from
such fordid Practises? Is a Benefice
to be look'd on as a meer Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to be bought and sold as other
Estates are? Is there no Sense of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Spiritual Imployment going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it? No Regard to the
Charge and Trust that attends it?
If nothing of a Spiritual Nature is
to be consider'd in a Benefice, then
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55952:57"/>
there can be no such thing as <hi>Simony:</hi>
and then their Hearts are at Ease,
and they may publish Papers for
<hi>Presentations,</hi> as well as for <hi>Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Incumbents.</hi> But I will not
suppose such hard things of Persons,
who pretend to be in Holy Orders:
but this I must put them in mind
of; that there is an Oath to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and a very strict one, against
all <hi>Simoniacal Contracts, either directly
or indirectly.</hi> And is wilfull Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a thing to be slighted by any?
especially by Churchmen, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a Cure of Souls? I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mention'd my Lord <hi>Coke's</hi>
Saying,<note place="margin">3. Inst. 156.</note> 
               <hi>That Simony is the more odious,
because it is ever accompanied with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;
for the Presentee is sworn to
commit no Simony:</hi> and for this he
referrs to <hi>Lyndwood.</hi> And I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shew'd, how <hi>Simony</hi> is to be
understood according to him. If a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55952:57"/>
solemn Oath comes to be slighted
and made little or nothing of; how
can such Men pretend to Religion
or Conscience? But it may be said,
<hi>That Simony is to be determined by the
Law; and the Law makes a Bargain
with the Patron to be Simony, and not
with the Incumbent.</hi> I have said e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
already to shew, that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
doth not determine what <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
is, but only inflicts a severe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
on some sorts of it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may be <hi>Simony,</hi> although not
expresly against the Words of the
Law. But the Words of the Law
are express against corrupt Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and I would fain know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Resignation for Money be
not a Corrupt Resignation? And
supposing the Patron innocent, can
any Man of common Sense or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
take the Oath, who comes in
upon such Terms, that <hi>he hath made
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55952:58"/>
no Simoniacal Contract or Promise, to
any Person or Persons whatsoever, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the procuring or obtaining the
Rectory or Vicarage</hi> &amp;c. Is not this
Bargain in order to the Procuring
or Obtaining the presentation? Let
it be with whom it will, if it be for
this End, it is <hi>Simoniacal;</hi> or else it
will be hard to determine what <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
is. And as to such kind of
<hi>Bonds</hi> of <hi>Resignation</hi> between Parties,
without the Patron's privity; how
can they signify any thing, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
do not accept the Resignation?
which I have shewed before must
be into his hands. But these Men
seem to set the Bishop quite aside;
or to suppose him very Weak and
Inconsiderate. All they look at, is
the Point of Law: And they may
say, <hi>They have advised with Council;
and they have told them, that there is
nothing against Law in this Practise.</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:55952:58"/>
How? not against Law? Did
they ask them, whether this were not
<hi>a Corrupt Resignation</hi> within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute?
<hi>No; but whether it were Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or not?</hi> I hardly suppose any
man that understands what <hi>Simony</hi>
is by our Law, would go so far:
but they might say, <hi>it doth not void
the Living, nor bring a disability on the
Person;</hi> and so far they said as the
Statute doth. But is this all, which
Men of Conscience, and who take
the Care of Souls, are to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
What! nothing but whether
<hi>the Benefice will be void or not?</hi> Or,
<hi>whether the King may Present or not?</hi>
Are these all the Considerations,
even of Clergymen, in such cases?
Such kind of Practises, which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
only of this world, are those
which give such Advantages against
our Profession, in such an Age of
Infidelity as ours. Do not you see,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55952:59"/>
say they, that they mind nothing
but their bare Interest as to this
World, and have no regard to Law
or Conscience, where they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it? I am sensible, how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
it is, to charge a Profession
with the Faults of a Few; and
those in comparison, I hope, not
considerable in it. But we ought,
if possible, to avoid any Scandal of
this kind; for it strikes at the whole
Body of the Clergy of our Church,
and at Religion it self: which if we
have any our selves, we shall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tender of the Honour of. Some
men have a mighty Prejudice against
any Churchmen medling in Secular
Affairs; although they be matters of
Justice and Mercy, which the Law
of the Land calls them to: but my
great Prejudice is against such
Churchmen, who bring Secular
ways of Trafficking into Church-matters;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55952:59"/>
as though nothing were
really minded, but <hi>buying, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and getting gain.</hi> Advancing
of Trade is a Noble Design in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that which makes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
at Home and Abroad:
but God forbid, that such a way of
Trading should ever be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, or be suffer'd to go
unpunished in it: for it will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ruine the best Church in the
World; by lessening the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Churchmen; by taking off
the good Affections of the People;
and making them to run into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Infidelity.</p>
            <p>There is certainly something more
to be regarded in these things besides
our own Interest: there is that of
Religion, of our Church, and of
the Laws of the Land; which ought
to overrule it. Suppose there were
nothing but the bare Law in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55952:60"/>
case, which expresly forbids all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Resignations; is it not fit for
those who are to Preach Obedience
to Laws, to observe them, in what
relates to themselves? Ought they
not to be Examples to others, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing of <hi>good Report?</hi> and to
abstain from whatever tends to take
off from the Influence of their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
upon the People? and nothing
doth it more, than when they are
suspected to come among them by
unlawful and indirect means.</p>
            <p>I have taken the Liberty in this
Discourse, to speak my Mind freely
about Matters, which touch upon
<hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Conscience;</hi> the Duties of
<hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Incumbents:</hi> but I have
done it, without any other Design,
than of doing some Good, or at
least preventing some Mischief to
the Church I live in, and which I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55952:60"/>
have a true and a just value for. If
I had not thought, that this kind of
<hi>Simoniacal Contracts</hi> were a great and
growing Mischief; and had not had
too much Reason to think so; I
should have spared my Pains, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have done: for I do not love
to be uneasy to my self or others.
I know very well, how ill such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
are apt to be taken by all
that are concerned in them; <hi>viz.
Patrons, Incumbents,</hi> and all such
<hi>Lawyers</hi> that go about to defend
them. But before I conclude this
Discourse, I must request some
things of all these: and then let
them judge as they please; so it be
without Prejudice and Partiality.</p>
            <p>1. That Patrons would consider,
that the Right of Patronage is a
Trust committed to them; of which
they must give an Account to God:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55952:61"/>
for there is an Obligation in Point of
Conscience, going along with it.
It is hard to believe what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Reported, how slight many
great Patrons make of their Bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Benefices, by letting Servants
make their best Advantage of them;
who scandalously expose the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
and themselves, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of those they depend upon.
If Servants deserve to be gratified;
for God's sake, let it not be at the
Price of Souls. If there were no such
thing as Religion; but that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Care of Souls is nothing but
an Artificial way of Maintaining a
Sert of Men, to keep the People in
a little better Order, by telling
them of Moral Duties, and another
World; then there were some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
for such an Affected Negligence
in these Matters: But I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that any of these Persons can
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55952:61"/>
satisfy themselves in such Absurd and
Unreasonable Imaginations; against
the Sense of all the Wiser and more
Considerate part of Mankind. But
it cannot be denied, that the Things
which they are to Teach the People
in point of Morality, are very good
things, and necessary to be told
them. This is all I desire at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
And is it of no Consequence,
what sort of Men those are, who
are entrusted with the Teaching
People their Duties to God and
Man? If Religion were only to
be regarded in point of Policy;
those must be far from <hi>Politicians,</hi>
who have no regard to the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Persons they put into
such Places. For Ignorant and Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Men can never give them
good Instructions; Scandalous and
Debauched Persons will certainly
do abundance of Mischief, making
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55952:62"/>
the People more loose and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than otherwise they would be.
Men of ill Principles will instill them
into the Heads of the busy part of
those they converse among, and
take upon them to guide; and make
them far more ungovernable than
otherwise they would be. I have no
very great Opinion of the World as
it is; but I cannot but think, that it
would be yet much worse, if an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
Vicious, Turbulent, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Clergy were put into all such
Places as Patrons dispose of: and
they know not, but they may be all
such whom they Present, if they
take no more care about them; but
suffer their Servants to make what
Bargains they think fit; who mind
not the Men, but the Advantage
they are to get by them. And there
is a just Presumption, that those are
not very Deserving, who are ready
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55952:62"/>
to drive such Bargains for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and such Men are not to be
valued, as Cattle in a Market, by
the Money they will yield.</p>
            <p>2. That Lawyers would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
their Clients in indirect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of obtaining Presentations.
For here lies a great part of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Mischief: the Clergymen who
want Benefices, They say; We are
Ignorant of the Law; but we go
to those whose business it is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it: and they tell us, they
have Cases and Precedents in their
Books, for such Bonds; and they
have been many times adjudged in
the Courts of Law to be good; and
therefore why are we to blame if we
submit to them? But here lies the great
Mistake: the Point is really a Point of
Conscience as to the Oath; but the
Question put to them can be only a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55952:63"/>
Point of Law; who are to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Statute, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rules of Judgment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in their Courts. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but observe, that there is no
Precedent offer'd before 8 <hi>Iac.</hi> 1.
and in the <hi>15th.</hi> was a contrary
Judgment. In the Beginning of
<hi>Charles</hi> I. the former Judgment was
affirmed; and from hence it hath
come to be such a prevailing Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
I confess, that I am not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
how far such Precedents, or
one or two Judicial Sentences make
a thing to pass for Law; nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Authority of such a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or the Reason, is to give the
Force of Law to it. I observe
that my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> when he speaks
of the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> he reckons
up <hi>Common-Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Inst. 11. 110. b. 115. b.</note> 
               <hi>Statute-Law, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
reasonable</hi> &amp;c. but he never
mentions the Judgment of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55952:63"/>
Courts, as any Part of our Law;
they being no more but a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sentence of the Majority of
the Judges, when it may be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
differ upon better Reasons;
and when such Reasons come to be
thought better by one more at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, then the contrary must
pass for Law on the same grounds.
How often do we hear that the
Judges were divided in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in point of Law? How often,
that the greater number went one
way, but Law and Reason on the
other? Suppose a Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of great Skill and Knowledge
in the Law, to be unequally yoked
with others of far less Judgment;
how is it possible to prevent that
Judgment shall not be given on the
wrong side, if the three happen to
be of an Opinion against him; or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55952:64"/>
one be absent, and two be against
one? In a late great Cause, <hi>viz.</hi>
of <hi>Commendam;</hi> although three Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
concurred in Opinion, and the
General Practise was allowed to be
of that side; yet because one Judge
differ'd from the rest, his Authority
was produced against the Sentence
of the Court: and for what Cause
can this be, but the Supposition,
that it is not the Sentence, but the
Reason which makes the Law.
My Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hales</hi> in a
MS. Discourse of <hi>the History and
Analysis of the Laws of</hi> England,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. makes three Constituents of
the Common Law of <hi>England:
1. The Common Usage and Custom:
2. The Authority of Parliament: 3. The
Iudicial Decisions of Courts of Iustice:</hi>
but how? <hi>Consonant to one another in
the Series and Succession of Time.</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:55952:64"/>
This is spoken with great Judgment:
For, no doubt, a mighty Regard
ought to be shewed to a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Sense of so many Persons of
Ability in the Law, in the different
Times wherein such Matters have
been before them; and this is the
highest Authority for expounding
the Law; but it cannot amount to
the Making of a Law. For, as
the same Excellent Person adds; <hi>It
is true, the Decisions of Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
although by the strength of the Law
of this Kingdom, they do bind as a
Law between the Parties to it in that
particular Case in Question, till Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Error or Attaint; yet they do
not make a Law: for that only the
King, by the Assent of Parliament,
can do.</hi> All that I aim at, is not
in the least to take off from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Reverence due to Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55952:65"/>
Decisions, built upon a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Agreement from time to time;
or upon Evident Reason in point of
Law: but only that things should
not be so positively asserted to be
Law, which are built only on a
few Modern Precedents, without
any convincing Evidence. Which
I take to be the present Case.</p>
            <p>3. That the Clergy would mind
their own Honour and Interest, and
that of the Church and Religion so
much, as not to Accept of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon such Ensnaring Terms, as
those of Bonds of Resignation.</p>
            <p>If what I have said on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be true; I am sure they have
all the Reason in the World to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
them: when they know not
what the Consequence of them may
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55952:65"/>
be; and they do know what kind
of Oath they are to take. And no
Man can honestly take an Oath, that
is not satisfied, that such Bonds are
no <hi>Simoniacal Contract</hi> in the Sense of
that Law, by which he is required
to take the Oath. Now the Oath
is not imposed by the Courts of
Common Law in pursuance of the
Statute; for then it were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
according to the Sense and
Meaning of it; but that very Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
leaves <hi>the Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> as
they were; by which <hi>Simony</hi> is of
a larger Extent than it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<hi>at Common Law;</hi> and by those
Laws this Oath is required. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Request is to all such
Clergymen, as are in danger of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such put upon them; that they
would study the Case, and satisfy
their Minds before they venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55952:66"/>
taking an Oath; which may
afterwards rob them of that Peace
and Tranquillity of Mind, which
every Good man will Esteem above
any Benefice in the World.</p>
