         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AN <hi>Apophthegme,</hi> called in French
<hi>Un bon Mot, (a good Word)</hi> and
which may be called in English, <hi>A good
Saying,</hi> tho it's Signification is somewhat
more extensive in the Original, is a pithy
and short Sentiment upon a Subject; or a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eady, and sharp answer, which causeth Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or Admiration. From thence arises
the great distinction in <hi>Apophthegmes,</hi>
between those that are grave and sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and such as are purely pleasant; which
I have purposely observed, and separated,
because the mixture of serious, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
together, hath something of monstrous
in it; which appears not with a good deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.
But, as we are compounded of two
parts, which have nothing of common, but
their being united together, and each of them
standing often in need of different recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
one may turn to those that are pleasant,
<pb facs="tcp:60557:6"/>
when Mirth is required, as we use Interlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
in Tragedies to unbend the mind, which
is so much upon the stretch in Heroicks. An
<hi>Apophthegme</hi> is properly therefore, neither
a Sentence, nor Proverb, nor Example, nor
Fable, nor <hi>Enigma,</hi> nor any the like; of
which however <hi>Apophthegmes</hi> may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be made, when well and fitly applyed,
And I have therefore inserted many sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
in this collection, because they seem as
<hi>Apophthegmes</hi> of some <hi>Philosophers.</hi> There
are others likewise which are mute ones, which
by certain and significant signs make us know
what is meant; tho all these are indeed but
improperly reckoned for <hi>Apophthegmes.</hi>
The foundation of this work is taken from
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Diogenes Laertius, &amp;c.</hi> But
I have not omitted the addition of a great
many others gathered from <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and
such as <hi>Lycosthenes</hi> hath reduced into
Chapters. Notwithstanding I have neither
followed the Method of the one which is too
confused, nor of the other, which smells too
much of the Colledge. The mind loves to
range freely here and there from Flower to
Flower, like the Bees, without fixing too
long upon any one, and so gather's that Honey
which is distributed into little Cells, where
every thing lyes in it's own place without
disorder, and where every particular may
<pb facs="tcp:60557:6"/>
be found out upon occasion. One would say,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he mind were jealous of it's prerogative,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd displeased when any one does undertake

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o cut out it's work, or prescribe any other
Method besides it's own. Thence proceeds
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he disgust is often taken in the Learning of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Sciences, where the Mind must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and obliged to certain rules for it's
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nstruction, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> has not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
in this work, because nothing ought to
be so surprizing, or so little Studyed, as a
good <hi>Apophthegme.</hi> For this reason, I
have set down no moral reflections, no
more then he, as relishing too much of the
Scholar or Preacher: And likewise because
there ought somewhat to be left to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or the hearers guess and judgement
to breed the greater delight in either. Only
I have drawn some short notes and remarks
to give light to some things that seemed most
obscure.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I do not know any
piece of Antiquity that stood in greater need
of being revised and corrected then this
same, which wanted the Authors last and
Finishing touches. <hi>Erasmus</hi> himself has
committed an hundred faults, thorough his
great hast, and because he went about it but
by piece-meal, some part at one time, others
at another; nor hath <hi>Lycosthenes</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:60557:7"/>
better. I have therefore transpos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
divers <hi>Apophthegmes</hi> of <hi>Plutarch's</hi>
which were so strangely misplaced, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral,
which belonged to the Lacedemon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were disjoyned from the main Body the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
belonged to, but are here united as they ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to be. The self same Saying was oft-times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
under divers Names, which is as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleasing to the <hi>Gusto,</hi> as the serving of
the same cold meat in several Dishes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
have also taken away some that seemed to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
common, and others whose Beauty and smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
consisted in the proprieties of the Greek
and Latin Tongues, which could not be wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
translated, considering that one bad one
were enongh to spoil twenty good ones in the
opinion of the Reader. I have likewise
discarded some Examples that properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
not to the Subject they were listed
under, tho several were so pertinent, I
thought it were pitty to lay them quite
aside.</p>
            <p>On the other hand to make them the more
quaint and concise, which is an essential
property of an <hi>Apophthegme,</hi> I have
pared away all the Superfluous Circumstances,
because when we would see a thing perfectl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He condemned a Poet to make satisfaction
for having spoken somewhat too freely before

               <p>His Son having violated a Woman of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
he asked him in passion, if ever he had

not born Son of a King, answered he. You
will never be the Father of one replied he, if
you continue these insolencies. His Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was verified, for his Son was dispossessed.
These are two excellent Apophthegmes in one.</p>
               <p>Seeing in his Son's Chamber one day a great
many Vessels of Gold and Silver, which he had
bestowed upon him; Thou art not worthy to

               <p>His Subjects complaining of a Tax, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased

they durst not have derided him.</p>
               <p>He said to his Mother, who had a mind to
marry again in her extream old age; That
Princes were able to alter the Civil Laws, but
not the Laws of Nature.</p>
               <p>He severely punished those that robbed on
the High-ways, but pardoned such as pilfered
Cloaks in the Night time, to compel his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to keep good hours and avoid debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
In the Greek it is, that stole Cloaths, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Some body beseeching him to bestow a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <p>Another desiring to converse with him,
asked him whether he had nothing to do?
God defend, said he, there being nothing so
insupportable as Idleness. Others there are
that think nothing so pleasing, but we must
distinguish; one may desire to have Leasure,
but Idleness is to be hated. It is a common
thing to ask what shall we do to pass away the

               <p>One of his Subjects having concealed a Sum
of Money, he caused it to be taken from him,
but being made acquainted that he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
a piece of Ground with the remainder;
he restored it to him again, because he knows
how to improve it, said he.</p>
               <p>He said, a Prince ought not only to be aware

               <p>After the Battle of <hi>Charonea,</hi> as some wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

counselling him to put all the <hi>Athenian</hi> Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to the Sword, and destroy their City, he
said, he would not lose the Theatre of his
Glory. Either because they would celebrate
his Clemency, or exercise his Valour.</p>
               <p>He would have encamped in a place of great
advantage for strength; when they brought
him word the Country was destitute of all
Forage: What a trouble it is, cried he, that
the General of an Army must not only take
care for his Men, but for Beasts? The Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> said to this same purpose, That Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
was a Monster, which began to be formed by
the Belly, because of the regard that must be
had above and before all other things for the
subsistance of their Troops.</p>
               <p>Having been told that a Castle which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to attaque was impregnable,<note place="margin">And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was said that it was not he, but his mony that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </note> he asked<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
whether an Ass laden with Gold might not
get in. This is particularly true in a Civil
War, where many change Party for Interest,
and so are the more easily corrupted.</p>
               <p>He bid <hi>Alexander</hi> gain the affections of the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> whilst he was not their Master,
for when he was so, they would love him no
longer, because of the Taxes and other seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of Monarchies, which makes Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
hateful, besides that it is natural not to
love ones Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60557:17"/>He likewise counselled him to gain the
love of the bad, as well as the good Subjects,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat he might make use of either of them as
his occasions required. He meant it of bad
men that had an interest and credit; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that it should be said, to make the one fear
you, and the other love you.</p>
               <p>Being present at the sale of some Captives;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igh whispered him in his ear, to pull down
the skirt of his Garment: Let that man be set
at liberty, said he, for I did not know that he
was my Friend.</p>
               <p>One of his Friends being dead, and some
body telling him, to comfort him, that he had
lived long enough; long enough for himself,
said he, but not for me; who have not yet
discharged the Obligations I owed him.</p>
               <p>Having understood that <hi>Alexander</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
because he took several Women, and
feared he would beget too many Children.
Let him, said he, shew himself worthy to be
preferred. Note that Kings formerly chose
their Successors without any regard to Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
as appears by <hi>David</hi>'s advancing of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He bid him, when he appointed <hi>Aristotle</hi> to
be his Tutor, learn under so good a Master to
avoid those failings which his Father had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into.</p>
               <p>One of his Courtiers intreating him not to
let Judgment pass in a Cause where the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of his Friend was concerned; I had rather,
said he, that your Friend should lose his Cause,
than I my Reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60557:18"/>His whole Court advising him to chastise the
Ingratitude of the <hi>Peloponesians,</hi> who had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly

What will they not do, said he, if I should
hurt them, when they scoff at me though I have
done them so much good. This resembles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that before spoken, of a vile tongue that had
spoken ill of him, whom he would not banish,
least he should rail at him all the World over.</p>
               <p>One day having lain long in Bed in his
Camp, he said he had slept his fill, because <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater</hi>
waked for him, excusing his sloth ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with the vigilance of his Minister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> having tamed a very wild Horse,
whom none else durst mount. Seek another
Empire for thy self my Son, said he, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him, for mine is too little.</p>
               <p>Another time, he said to him, as he was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
his own Singing; art not thou ashamed
to sing so well. There are some things we
ought to be ignorant of, wherein it is shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be too skilful.</p>
               <p>One day having fallen down on the ground,
and considering the extent of his Body in the
dust, Great Gods, said he, what a little place we
take up, and yet the World cannot contain us.</p>
               <p>He told his Son, who was endeavouring to
win the <hi>Macedonians</hi> hearts by largesses; dost
thou believe that a man whom thou hast bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
will ever be faithful to thee. Those who
are tied by Interest, are by Interest likewise
lost.</p>
               <p>Asking some <hi>Athenian</hi> Ambassadors, after he
had given them Audience, whether he could

                  </gap>hese Insolencies, said he, are much more honest
men, than those that commit them; which
was the more to purpose because they came to
complain of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alexander.</note> while a Youth, said his Father
would leave nothing for him to conquer, and
when they told him, that what his Father
gained, would be for him: But I shall not
have the glory of it, replied he, as esteeming
more the honour than the profit of Conquests.</p>
               <p>His Father advising him to run at the Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
Games, to shew his Swiftness. I would
do it, said he, if there were any Kings to run
with me for the Prize, or contend with me.</p>
               <p>The Governour of a Place having written
to him, that there were brought to him some
lovely Boys that were to be sold; he cried
out in great anger, hath he perceived any thing
in my behaviour that could prompt him to
send me such a Message. So he was likewise
displeased in his Youth, against some of his
People that had brought a young married
Woman to lie with him; and turned away
one of his Courtiers for having introduced, at
dinner time, a Lass that he entertained under
the pretence of Singing. The same Principle
made him refuse to see the Wife of <hi>Darius,</hi>
who was one of the most beauteous Princesses
in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60557:19"/>His Governour having reproved him fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

casting whole handfuls of Incense into the
fire at a Sacrifice, and telling him that he
should avoid being so profuse till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the Country that produced them. He
had no sooner made himself Master of <hi>Arabia</hi>
but he sent him a great quantity, with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
That he should not for the future be
so sparing, when it concerned the Service of
the Gods. I doubt whether ever he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He bid his Soldiers, at the Passage of <hi>Granique,</hi>
which was the Limits of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire,
That they should make merry with what they
had then, for the next day they were to be
entertained at the Enemies expences.</p>
               <p>A Philosopher whom he loved, having asked
him to bestow a Portion to marry his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he sent him fifty Talents, who having told
him it was too much, and that ten would
have been enough for them to have; But not
enough for <hi>Alexander</hi> to give, replied he.
However our Gifts should be proportioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Party that receives. But this
Prince was excessive in all his Actions, whether
good or bad.</p>
               <p>Another time when his Treasurer came and
acquainted him, that the Philosopher <hi>Anaxar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
demanded an hundred Talents; for he
had commanded that they should give him
whatever he should ask; He knows he hath to
do with <hi>Alexander,</hi> said he. Another Huff of
this Prince coupled with the Impudence of a
Philosopher.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60557:19"/>Beholding several Statues in <hi>Milet,</hi> of those
<hi>Atheletes</hi> that had won the Prizes in the Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
Games. Where were all these Bravo's,
said he, when your City was taken?</p>
               <p>He answered the Queen of <hi>Caria,</hi> who took
a pride in the excellency of her Cooks, and
did often send him of her Dainties; That he
had much better of his own, that his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
had taught him to eat but little at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that he might eat well again at Supper,
and to march all the Night to get a good Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
in the Morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Darius</hi> having offered him ten thousand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
and the one half of his Empire. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menion</hi>
was of Opinion he should accept of it,
and said, if I were <hi>Alexander</hi> I would do it,
and so should I likewise if I were <hi>Permenion,</hi>
replied he. He added, that Heaven cannot
contain two Suns, nor Earth two Masters.</p>
               <p>At the Battle of <hi>Arbella,</hi> the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
complaining of the Soldiers insolence,
who threatned they would have all the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

sign of the Victory, for those that talk thus,
have no design to fly.</p>
               <p>The Armies being drawn up in <hi>Battalia,</hi> he
stroke a Soldier that was mending his Javelin:
For this is the time for Fighting, said he, not
to be mending or furbushing your Arms.</p>
               <p>As he was reading a Letter from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

him, and read it likewise; he took his Seal
from his Finger, and put it to his Lips, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct

Religion.</p>
               <p>He spake to the same sence when wounded,
That it was not such Liquor which flows from
the wounds of the Gods.</p>
               <p>He replied to those that praised <hi>Antipater</hi>
for being very modest in his Habit; That
within he was all lined with Purple, and the Son
of <hi>Antipater</hi> going to caress before him, one
that was beloved by a Musician, he interposed,
and cried out, What, shall not Friendship it
self be exempted from your Tyranny?</p>
               <p>As he was sending back to <hi>Macedonia</hi> the

health having thrust in his name to follow
a Woman whom he loved. We must try,

I thought it well worthy our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
were it only to discover the ground
and principles upon which those great Men
founded their Actions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> did eat all together in
great Inns and the oldest told the last comers,
nothing is to be exposed abroad that we say
here,<note place="margin">Like the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> with whom in other things they had much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</note>

               </p>
               <p>They were very temperate in their eating
and drinking; and the greatest dainty that
was brought to their Table was a certain pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
Tannè, which was the ordinary food of
their aged people. <hi>Denys</hi> the Tyrant having
expressly sent for a Cook from <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> to
make some for him, &amp; not finding it agreeable to
to his palate; 'Tis, said the Cook, to be eaten on

Exercise: because Labour whets the Appetite,

well. <hi>Witness him that drank Puddle Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </p>
               <p>They retired every night to their homes

Hunting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After their Children could write and read,
they taught them nothing else, but to obey
the Magistrates, to inure themselves to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
and resolve to be Victors in fight, or die
on the spot. <hi>The Masters of other Sciences were
not so much as admitted in</hi> Lacedemonia.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> wore no Doublets, had
but one Garment in a year, without any
change according to the season: used little
Bathing or Stows, Oyled themselves but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and were not very curious in their habits,
or manners, <hi>To banish Luxury and soft Delicacy,
as being contrary to war like People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Youth lay in Troops upon Mats made
of Reeds of the Flaggy tops which grew about
the sides of their Rivers, and in Winter they
mixt somewhat that was warmer. <hi>The heads
of those Reeds ends like a feather, and is foft e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,

if any one had complained that another

               <p>As they gave but little to their Children

for having invented a new string which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
their notes and accords, and cut off two
which another had added to the Lyre.</p>
               <p>Their Songs were composed of divers cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plets,
in which they answered one another by
turns. In some the old ones told'em how brave
they had been, the middle-ag'd in another would
tell how brave they were; and the youths would
promise they hoped to exceed them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The steps were military, as well as the
time, and their harmony being mingled with
somewhat of Enthusiasme transported them to
such a degree as to despise death it self.</p>
               <p>They buried their dead within the City near
their Temples, without any ceremony or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
or other Funeral state, but only a
red cloth which wrapped them all over and
some Olive leaves; this Burying was common
to all, mourning and effeminate lamentation
as well as Epitaphs were banished, which
was never allowed to any but such as died in the
Wars.</p>
               <p>They would not permit their youth to travel,
that they might not be corrupted with forreign
customs, nor were strangers suffered to come

and dwell in <hi>Lacedemonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those young men that had not been bred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Spartan</hi> way, could not enjoy
any of their priviledges, whereas a stranger
that had been so, enjoyed them all. 'Tis said
they had their portions likewise when they
first shared their Lands, with this <hi>Proviso</hi> only,
that they might not sell them.</p>
               <p>At their huntings they were allowed to make
use of their Neighbours Dogs, Horses, and all
other Equipage, when they did not use it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
restoring every thing to them again and
not spoiling them.</p>
               <p>In a time of War they were cloathed in red,
as being a Martial colour, and on which
the blood is not so conspicuous when woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>When they had overcome by a slight, they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
an Ox, and when it was by force, a
Cock; to prefer Prudence before Valour as a
higher Vertue.</p>
               <p>They asked nothing of their Gods but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in their labour,<note place="margin">In the <hi>Greek</hi> it is to suffer Injuries.</note> and to be happy when
they did well. <hi>This explication is proved by that

               </p>
               <p>All their Gods, <hi>Venus</hi> not excepted, were
painted in armour to honor Valour, and make it
known they were not in a condition to receive
injuries.</p>
               <p>They ordinarily said, one must pray to the
Gods with an Arm out-stretched, as much as

               <p>They were wont to shew their Slaves
drunk to their Children, to make them abhor
Drunkenness.</p>
               <p>When they were to go into any House, they
did not knock at the door; but called aloud
in the street, that they should come &amp; open
it.</p>
               <p>In their Baths they used Rubbers made of

               <p>They neither acted Tragedies nor Comedies,
that no offence might be committed against the

               </p>
               <p>They expelled a Poet, for having said, that

Husbandry it self, to which purpose they
made use of their Slaves, as their Farmers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taxing them too much or too little, for
fear of making them lazy or desperate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were thus always at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
which is a pleasant thing, and they were
forbidden to meddle with Navigation, and
even to fight at Sea, but they afterwards
broke that Custom and renew'd it again, finding
their manners were thereby corrupted.</p>
               <p>As the use of Riches was utterly banished,
there was no fear they should labour in vain to
acquire any, and the first that attempted it were
condemned to death: For an Oracle had been
pronounced to two Kings: That Riches
would prove the ruine of <hi>Sparta.</hi> This Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
was abolished by little and little, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander</hi>
after the taking of <hi>Athens,</hi> filled the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with riches, not only without danger, but
with much Honor.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Sparta</hi> observed these Laws, they
were the chiefest of <hi>Greece</hi> the space of five
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60557:66"/>
hundred years; but coming to relax; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness
insinuating it self, their Allies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
them, finding their strength decay. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
after the Battle of <hi>Cheronea,</hi> when
all <hi>Greece</hi> had elected <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,

though feeble, and without any Walls. But at
last having forsaken all their Customs,<note place="margin">Nabis, &amp;c.</note> they
were subjected to their own Tyrants, and put
their necks under the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke with the rest
of the World.</p>
               <p>A part of these Customes being included in
the Apophthegms of <hi>Licurgus,</hi> we will marshal
them together, because they will serve to give
light to many things; and it will not be
amiss, to bring him in the Front, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Licurgus</hi> willing to wean his Citizens from
their debauchery, to make them Vertuous,
and to let them see how Education and Exercise
changed and out-stripped Nature, brought
two dogs forth in Publick, one bred to hunting
the other in the Kitchen; and having caused a
Hare to be let loose, and meat to be laid down,
the first coursed the Hare, the other ran to the
meat, though they were both fit for the chase,
but the last was utterly spoiled for want of
exercise. By this means, he shewed them, it
was not enough they were descended from
<hi>Hercules,</hi> as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were, unless,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60557:67"/>
like him, they exercised themselves in vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ways.</p>
               <p>After he had divided the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in nine thousand equal portions,
finding at Harvest time that all their heaps
were equal in the Fields, he said, that all
<hi>Laconia</hi> seemed the partnership of so many
Brothers.</p>
               <p>He would have done the same with their
Goods, after he had abolished all manner of
Debts; but the rich opposing him, he made
their Riches become useless by prohibiting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
the use of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> in any thing,
and suffering only Iron money to pass Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
He likewise retrenched other superflu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so that in <hi>Sparta</hi> was to be found, neither
<hi>Merchant,</hi> nor <hi>Cook,</hi> nor <hi>Lawyer,</hi> nor
<hi>Mountebank,</hi> nor <hi>Astrologer,</hi> and injustice
was banished by his having cut up the
root of it which is covetousness. And
to take away all excess indyet, as he had
done in Houshold Goods, he ordained
they should eat in common, in publick

dainties then his fellows.</p>
               <p>Those were blamed that did not come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as voluptuous People; insomuch that
King <hi>Agis</hi> desiring to sup at home with his wise
after his return from the gaining of a Victory
they would not send him his proportion, and
the next day condemned him to pay a Fine.
Notwithstanding the wealthier sort, angry at
this Method, which hindred them of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60557:67"/>
of their Riches, would have stoned
him to death, had he not fled into a Temple,
with the loss of one eye. He that had struck
out his eye, being afterwards delivered into
his hands to suffer Justice, instead of punishing
he pardoned him, made him eat at his Table
and of his Enemy made him his greatest
Friend, and his adorer.</p>
               <p>Whilst they were at meals, some were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be always in Arms as a Guard, to
psevent any disorders, or unlook'd for Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
but their number was never so great
as to be able to master the rest.</p>
               <p>To obviate all manner of cheats and little
quirks, and leave the Judges the liberty of
judging every thing according to it's circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
without being tied to the rigor of the
Law, he would have no written Laws.</p>
               <p>He forbad they should make use of any tools
about their buildings, besides the Axe, and
Saw, that they might be ashamed of providing
rich furniture for such ill Houses, and by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Door without any Art of Joyners work,
they should expect to find nothing within that
were magnificent.</p>
               <p>He enjoyned them likewise, not to make
War upon the same People too often, for fear
of making them too Warlike. <hi>The remainder
is elsewhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He caused Maidens to addict themselves
to Exercises of the body, and to wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
naked, to become the more robust,
and bring forth the more vigorous Children,
besides that it would make them the less sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60557:68"/>
of the pains of Child-bearing. By this
means he endeavoured to cure them of their
Feminine tenderness, and be only subject to
the like passions with Men, and fight in a time
of danger and necessity, in defence of their
Country. And indeed, the Wife of <hi>Leonidas</hi>
reproached those that told her, There were
none but the <hi>Macedonians</hi> that commanded over
Men; That there were none but them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
Men. But they were not suffered to be
seen by every one at those Exercises, no more
then the young Boys. That Priviledge being
allowed only to such as were married; and to
incite People the more to marriage, those that
were not so, were deprived of the Honor that
was given to old age. From thence it was that
<hi>Dercillidas</hi> taking it ill, that a young man did
not rise up from his Seat when he approached,
the young man replied, That <hi>Dercillidas</hi> had
begot no Children that might shew him the
like respect another time.<note place="margin">But by this means the homely ones did not easily get Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They gave no Portion with their Daughters
in Marriage, to prevent making love to them
for any thing but their merits, and that the
meaner sort might be sought after as well as the
rich. All use of Face-painting and other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were strictly prohibited, that they
might have no other advantage but their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>He prescribed a time for marriage, as well
for Maidens, as Batchelors, that so coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the flower of their Age, they
might have the healthier and lustier Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60557:68"/>
He would not suffer those who were newly
married to meet together, but as it were,
by stealth, lest they should be glutted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled
by a continual enjoyment.</p>
               <p>He forbad to put Oyl into perfumes, that
so precious a thing might not be idly wasted;
and banished all Arts generally, which serve
only for shew, and even the Dyers Trade was
not admitted, which he called a Flattery of the
Sences, or Deception of Sight.</p>
               <p>Chastity was so great in those days, and
Women so little acquainted with the liberty
that came in since, that a stranger admiring
there was no Law established against Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
was told there was no such thing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that place, whence they had expelled all
luxury, and debauchery. <hi>Whatever</hi> Plutarque
<hi>sayes,</hi> Licurgus <hi>his Customs were too licentious in
that matter: For they lost all modesty by their
wrestling naked before Men, being themselves
Virgins, and the liberty he allowed in some cases
that a man might kiss his Neighbours Wife, did
in some manner authorize their debauches. And
therefore</hi> Aristotle <hi>condemns all the Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Women: besides that he forbad them the
carrying any Lights in the Night time, or to
lye every one with his own: which gave the
Gallants great opportunity for amorous adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all the Exercises of the body, he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those only wherein the hand is extended:
that is to say, he condemned fighting with the
closed Fist, or any such like, which might
hurt or enfeeble those, whom he designed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60557:69"/>
to strengthen by continual Exercise.</p>
               <p>He ordained they should make Offerings to
the Gods of things of small Value, that they
might never want wherewith to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>In time of War he would make them often
remove their Camp, whether for healths sake
or to put the Enemy to the greater trouble,
and forbid them to make any Siege, because
the bravest man might be slain by a Coward, by
a Woman, or a Child.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> consulting with him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Funeral mourning once a year for
<hi>Leucothee:</hi> If she be a Goddess 'tis ridiculous
to mourn for her; and if a Woman, to adore
her, said he.</p>
               <p>To one that praised <hi>Democracy,</hi> settle it in
your own Family, said he,</p>
               <p>He said, the means to prevent any ones ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of War upon them, was to be poor; there
being nothing to be gained of such, and to
share every one alike, there being then no
cause of division, but every one would have the
same interest for the presevation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p>He told some that admired the City of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
was not walled, and fortified, that it was
so by the Valous of it's Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>He gave order to spare the Enemy in fight,
as soon as they left off defending themselves,
that they might not force them to make head
again through dispair; besides that it is
not generous to kill those that make no
defence: Neither would he suffer them
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60557:69"/>
strip the dead, lest they should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaden
with plunder, and give the Enemy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to rally.</p>
               <p>He said, that reward and punishments, were
the two poles upon which all Government tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>He ordained them to wear long Hair,
because it made the handsome more comely,
and the unhadsome more dreadful.</p>

OF
The LACEDEMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIANS,
According to Xenophon.
To serve as a Commentary to that
of Plutarque.</head>
               <p>VVHen we consider that the
Republick of <hi>Sparta</hi> which
was the poorest and the least
peopled of any in <hi>Greece,</hi> is become the most
illustrious, and the most potent, it fills us with
astonishment; But when we come to cast our
Eye upon their Laws and Customs, there is
nothing to be admired but the Prudence of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60557:70"/>
                  <hi>Legislator,</hi> who hath made them great and
flourishing by methods opposite to all others.
First, as to what concerns the Children, which
are like the Foundations of an Empire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in <hi>Greece,</hi> they will not suffer maidens to
eat their fill, or to drink Wine, or if they
allow any, it is but very little, the contrary is
practised in <hi>Lacedemonia;</hi> and whereas in
other places they sit all day long at their work,
like Artisans; <hi>Lycurgus</hi> thought there were
Servants enough to spin, and make cloathing
for them all, and would have the Daughters
employ themselves like us, in running and
wrestling, and other the like Exercises, that
they might bring forth lusty and vigorous
Children, which the other kind of Education
does much impair. And then considering that
people newly married are subject to run into
an excess of Nuptial pleasure which enervates
their strength, he would never let them
come together but by stealth, it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
as it were something shameful to be
found together; thereby to allay their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat,
and prevent an over-glut, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attends a full enjoyment of our desires.
Neither did he allow the freedom to marry at
any age, but would have them coupled when
they were in their prime strength and ripeness
to get Children, fearing lest otherwise the
fruit might partake of the debility of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the decay of it's producer. And if
sometimes they grant an Elderly man the
liberty of Matrimony, Whereas in other
places they are the most jealous, here they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60557:71"/>
make choice of the most beautiful young ones
to supply their own defects, and bring them
a Race worthy of <hi>Sparta.</hi> Even young people
that have no mind to wed, have a right of
desiring a married man, that hath a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Wife, to give them leave to beget
Children, who without any right of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
serve only as a prop to the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>These Customs, though a little strange, are
the cause that there is no where to be found
such strong and large men as in <hi>Lacedemonia.</hi>
Having now spoken of what concerns their
production, let us treat of their Education.
As soon as ever Children can but understand
what is said to them, the <hi>Greeks</hi> who are
most careful chuse out some Slaves for
Tutors, and send them to the Colledge, to be
taught to read and write, as well as Musick,
and other Exercises. They shooe them neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and change their habits according to the
different seasons which makes them tender
and less capable of Labour. But <hi>Licurgus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Slaves, allots one of the principallest
of the City of be their Master, who brings
them together every day, and chastizes those
that fail; so that the youth of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi>
learn much modesty and obedience in their
greenest years. Instead of being neatly shod
he makes them go bare-footed, which does
harden their Legs; and makes them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to climb up, or get down any
steep or craggy places, and more active in
their Exercise. They are allowed but one
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60557:71"/>
Garment a year, that they may be early used
to endure heats and cold: and whereas others
eat as much as they list, these are not so well
treated but they learn from their infancy to
be able to endure both hunger and thirst in
case of necessity. Besides, not having their
Stomachs over-loaden with Victuals, their
minds are freer, their spirits clearer, &amp; their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
more healthy &amp; fit for action, &amp; apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in growth to a just proportion. But they
are suffered to pilfer little things, that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them from being incommoded through
hunger. And indeed, it is well enough
known the Law-maker did not thus contrive
it out of frugality, nor because of any scarcity,
but to rowze their Ingenuity by this artifice. For
to filtch any thing from those who had the
command of the Kitchen, they were forced to
watch whole nights, to lay in ambuscade,
and set out Sentinels to avoid being taken
in the fact; which altogether does some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
resemble an apprentiship in war. But
how will some object, if it were lawful to
steal does it come to pass they should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for theft? I answer, it is the same as
is currant with the learners of any other
Trade, when they do not their business well.
'Tis not for the theft that they are punished;
but because they could not steal cleverly:
whereby they learn to know that in actions
which require Skill and Experience,<note place="margin">They were whipped once a year on <hi>Diana's</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</note> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thrive that are slow and stupid. As for
the pain or smart they endured, it was to inure
them betimes, that they might lead the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60557:72"/>
of their lives in quiet and without
fear. Notwithstanding as their Governor
could not be ever present to instruct them, so
the first that came, had a charge to supply his
Office, and if none came, then the ablest of
themselves took the care; so that they never
wanted some to be their Guide, which makes
them become wise and respectful: for there is
in no place so much respect shown to those that
command as in <hi>Lacedemonia.</hi> As for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Boys or young men in their Amours;
since that is part of the Education of youth,<note place="margin">A man and wife.</note>
Whereas in <hi>Beotia,</hi> it is permitted to cohabit
with them; and in <hi>Elide</hi> to enjoy the Flower
of their beauty, though in other places it is
forbidden so much as to converse with them:
<hi>Licurgus,</hi> neither imitating the Severity of
the one, nor the Licentiousness of the other,
would have them converse together, to incite
each other to Vertue; but not to touch them
any more then a Father would his Child. For
that is infamous, though some can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, because the practise in <hi>Greece</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in most parts. Now I leave it to be
judged which of these Customs are most likely
to beget respect and modesty, either these of
<hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> or the others. Truly, you
could neither hear them talk, nor cast their
eyes about, when they walked in the streets
any more then if they had been Marble Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
They hold their hands folded up in
their Robe, appear more bashful then a maiden,
and when they come to their Inns, do not say
a word, unless a question be propounded,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60557:72"/>
which demonstrates that our Sex is as capable
of modesty as the womens. All these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
were ordained by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to beget
modesty, the chiefest foundation for Vertue.
When they have attained to the age of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
or thereabouts, whereas in other
places they let them rule themselves, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own discretion, without minding
their conduct any further; it is then we
take most care in <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> and keep them
most imployed to prevent them from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into the debauches incident to that age. And
those who will not be restrained by these rules
are not reckoned amongst people of credit:
So that, not only such as aspire to Offices and
employments, but others likewise are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to subject themselves to preserve their
reputation. When they begin to have most
ambition, and desire to appear, the <hi>Legislator</hi>
endeavours to augment it, and spur them on
with the love and sence of honor, to make
them the more eager after Fame. To this end,
the <hi>Ephores</hi> chuse three of the best shaped
Youths, who each of them picks out an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more with a great deal of caution; they
being obliged to give a good reason for
their choice. These become the objects of
the jealousie and resentment of those that were
rejected, who are spyes upon all their actions
that they may discover their failings. From
thence arises a noble emulation very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the Republick, since it instructs young
people to discern betwixt good and evil, and
pushes them still onwards to perfection. For
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60557:73"/>
these three hundred aim at nothing else and do
their Country great service, whether singly
or together when opportunity presents. They
are careful to preserve their Vigour, for the
others ingage them to try their strength in any
place wherever they meet. But for fear these
contests should go too far, it is in the power of
the first that comes near to part them, and
those that will not obey are severely punished
to teach them not to be so overmuch transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with anger, as not to be in a condition
to obey Law and reason. When they grow
more advanced in Years and Stature, and are
capable of the best commands, for it is from
amongst these they are selected; whereas the
<hi>Greeks</hi> take them from their Exercises, to
go and bear Arms; <hi>Lycurgus</hi> sends
them to hunting, as being a kind of Image of
War, when they are not employed otherwise.</p>
               <p>This is the greatest part of their Exercises:
I will now speak of their manner of living. The
<hi>Legislator,</hi> having observed that divers kinds
of excess was committed at the feasts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches
so frequent amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he
found it better to make their meetings in
publick, where as decorum is easier kept. He
would therefore have them eat at Inns, where
they are served with every thing necessary
for life without Superfluity or want: Besides
the Hunters do often present them with
Venison, and the like Fare, and those who
are very rich, with all they have more then
is needful; by which means nothing is
wanting, altho they can neither get enough
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60557:73"/>
to be Surfeited nor drunk, none being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to drink. For being constrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home at night without any Lights, they
take a care to do it honourably: Every one
drinking what best pleases himself, which is
both more healthful and more delightful at
once. And whereas in other places, those of
near the same years do usually eat together;
the aged are here mixed with the Youthful;
which begets more respect, and ties up their
Tongues from running into any undecencies;
besides that their Colder Temper, is an allay
to the boiling heat of Youth. Thus is their
Instruction mingled with Delight; for they
discourse of nothing but the Brave Actions of
great Men. On the other hand, the Legislator
having by experience found that exercise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
mightily towards Health, and that
such as Labour have fresh and ruddy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
whereas the Idle Drones, are pale
and wan, or stuff'd with ill humours; he
ordered the eldest of every Inn to take care that
none overcharged himself with Meat, or Drink
to that Degree as not to be able to work; in
which he Succeeded so well, that there are
no healthier, nor more Laborious People for
all manner of Work, then the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
for they did always exercise their Arms,
their Legs, and their Backs. And there is
this in Particular that tho in other Cities
each Family hath it's Master who commands
both House and Goods, yet here one may
make use of any other mens goods without
Prejudice to any one. Any mans Children
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60557:74"/>
are commanded as if their own; So that if a
Child which one hath beaten runs to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to complain, he is obliged to correct
him anew, so well are they Satisfyed that none
would impose an unjust thing upon him, and
that they have dealt by him, as they would
have others do by theirs in a like occasion.
They likewise make use of any others Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
or their equipage. For after notice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any one that they are going a Hunting,
if he be not desirous or at Leasure to go
with them, he lends them his Horse, or
Dogs: And if any one wants a Chariot, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because he is not well, or upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account, he takes the first he meets
withal, and restores it again, when he hath
done with it, as if it were his own. Those
whom the night hath overtaken in Hunting,
if they have no Provision, eat what ever they
find ready at any other place, and when
they have had what is Sufficient they put up
the rest for the owner of it. By this means
the Poorest are provided for, out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of the Rich. There is another particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
very remarkable, which is this, that in other
places every one Labours to Enrich himself,
one by this Trade, another by that: But
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> have no other profession but
the Art of War, the rest being done by Slaves.
To what end, therefore, would it be to heap
up Riches, the use of it being prohibited,
and not to be imployed either in gaudy
Cloaths, nor delicacy of Diet, they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
health and Strength the greatest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60557:74"/>
of the body. Nor is it necessary to
help a Friend, for there every one may have
what he Stands in need of. It is enough
that one can make use of his Person when
requisite, which is more honourable. But
besides that it is not allowed amongst the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
to Enrich one's self by unjust ways,
it is also a very difficult thing; For it would
require a Cart to carry one hundred Crowns
of their Money, and it is forbidden under
great penalties to have either Gold or Silver,
after which they make very Strict Search.
The acquisition therefore and the possession of
wealth would bring more hurt and danger,
then it can pleasure. Furthermore, there is
no place, as I have said, where more respect
is given to the Laws and Magistrates; for,
whereas in other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> it is a kind
of infamy to obey, and the Rich men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with it; in <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> the greatest
men Strive most to express their obedience,
and run with hast and zeal wherever they are
commanded to give example unto others.
This makes me believe they gave consent to
those Laws establisht by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and that
with them he created the power of the <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
which is the more dreaded, by how much
it is the more absolute. For they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to cendemn whom they will to pay a fine,
and to make him pay it; to imprison, or
casbiere an Officer, and make him give account
of his actions, without waiting till the time
of his Service be expired. But the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> appears principally in his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60557:75"/>
having consulted the Oracle before he made
his Laws, thereby to give them a more then
humane Authority. It was likewise a great
craft in him to make them prefer an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Death, before a shameful life; because
more men are saved by their courage, then
their cowardize, and every one strugles to
help a Gallant Person, which shews that Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is the inseparable Companion of Virtue.
But it is necessary to know what he project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to render good men happy, and the other
sort Miserable. In other places, there is no
greater punishment for Cowards, or evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
then to pass for what they are. Mean
time, they Game, converse and trade with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other fort of men. But, in <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi>
it is a Scandal to admit them into company,
or to have any dealings with them; and in
their Assemblies they are always put in the
least honorable place. They are bound to
give way to any one in the Streets; To rise up
when they pass near them, as the Boyes do;
to justify any Suit of Law by the Sword;
To give account of their actions; To feed
their poor kindred, and marry, or pay a
lusty Fine. They dare not adorn themselves,
nor take the same freedom as Creditable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon pain of being abused. We must
not wonder therefore, if an honourable Death
be preferred before such an infamous life.
<hi>Lycurgus,</hi> did hitt this well too in my opinion,
for to preserve the fame of mens brave Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when they grew old, he established a kind
of Judicature where those Ancient Persons did
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60557:75"/>
preside till the time of their Death, to make
them the more honourable. In other places
they punish those that wrong their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
Here they punish such as do not do
all within their power to become most vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And indeed, by other sorts of Vices
we only do hurt to particular men, whereas
the Coward does an injury to all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
by basely betraying it; and it is for that
reason the Punishments he hath ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that sort of People is the most Severe.
In sine he hath imposed upon his Citizens
a pleasing and easy constraint of well doing,
by bestowing upon all worthy honest men a
Share in the advantages of the State, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be strong or weak, or Rich or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
men, and depriving the rest utterly
of them. For the Antiquity of these Laws
it appears by the time he lived in,
which was in <hi>Heraclides</hi> days, tho they may be
called new in respect of other people. But
that which is most wonderful, is that they
have been well known and admired by all the
World, and yet were never imitated by any.

               <p>Selling in his presence many Slaves, and
much Plunder gained from the <hi>Persians,</hi> and
finding all the People run to the Plunder, not
minding the Slaves because of their effeminate
breeding: Behold what are the Combatants,
said he, and what is the reward of comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</p>
               <p>He once refused some Presents from the King
of <hi>Persia,</hi> saying, he gloried more in taking
than in receiving from his Enemy, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Soldiers rich rather than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>He said he would rather be Master over
himself than the best City in the Enemy's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and rather preserve his own Liberty, then
usurp anothers.</p>
               <p>Though he was a great observer of the
Laws, yet he once wrote to a Judge, a Friend
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60557:77"/>
of his, who had imprisoned one, to release
him again, whether he were Innocent,
or Guilty, and that he would do this
either for his Requests, or for Justices sake.</p>
               <p>Upon a precipitate Decamping, wavering
whether he should forsake a sick person whom
he loved: How difficult is it, said he, to love,
and to be wise!</p>
               <p>He said a Prince ought to be distinguished
from his Subjects by his Vertues, and not by his
Pleasures; and therefore he went always simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clad, ate accordingly, and would lye no
softer then the meanest Soldier, and being told,
that he would one day perhaps be forced to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his method of living: I have used my self, said
he, not to change in a time for change. And
indeed, so he lived to his end, to take away all
excuse from young people when they saw a
Prince and an old man, do the same that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
them to practise.</p>
               <p>He said, The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Laws for their
chief foundation had the contempt of Pleasures,
and liberty for their reward.</p>
               <p>Passing through a Country where the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
lived in all Licentiousness, and they having
brought him a great many Presents, he took
only their Corn for his Soldiers, and when they
earnestly pressed him to accept of the rest, he
caused it to be distributed amongst the Slaves,
and said, Men of courage ought not to esteem of
those things, which were the delight of mean
Spirits.</p>
               <p>The same People having ordained divine
Honors to be paid him, he asked them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60557:78"/>
whether they had the power to make Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and if so, wherefore they did not begin
with themselves.</p>
               <p>With the same austerity he rejected those
Statues the Cities of <hi>Asta</hi> would have erected,
nor would suffer his picture to be made, there
being no Portraiture so good of any eminent
man as his own Actions.</p>
               <p>He used to say, The Strength of a City did
not consist in the Walls, but in the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of the Inhabitants. <hi>The Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is in the Apophthegmes of</hi> Licurgus, <hi>or</hi>
Antalidas.</p>
               <p>When he would have any thing done with
expedition, he put his own hand first to the
Work, and took a pride in labouring as much
as any private Soldier. <hi>The rest is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said, we ought not to heap up a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of riches, but of vertues.</p>
               <p>A Cripple seeking to get a Horse that he might
fight in a Battle, Friend, said he, thou seekest
for legs to run away withal, for thine are
good enough to stand in Fight with. <hi>It
is not so verbatim in the original, but that
is not so requisite in an Apophthegm, as the good
sence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Cripple being rallied withal for
going to the Wars, said, the question was
not running away, but standing stoutly to it.</p>
               <p>He was asked, how one should render
himself illustrious: By despising of Death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
he another time, to the same questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he answered, By saying well, and doing
the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:60557:78"/>
To one that asked him, wherefore the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> went to battle with the sound
of a flute, he replyed, To discern the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
from the valiant by the Gate of their
Marching. <hi>Lycurgus gives another reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As some were admiring the felicity of a
young Prince: At the same Age, saies he,
<hi>Priam</hi> was a happy man too.</p>
               <p>In the height of his Conquests, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
by the <hi>Ephores,</hi> he said, It was not

               <p>Upon his return, he asked whether they
would have him pass as a Friend, or an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and some <hi>Barbarians</hi> requiring an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Talents, and a hundred beautiful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
to let him pass quietly, he told them,
they should come and fetch them, and so
Marching immediately against them, defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them.</p>
               <p>Having asked the same thing of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
King, and that Prince desiring time to
consider. Let him consider still, said he, in
the mean time we will not stop our
March.</p>
               <p>Two of his Friends having been detained
in a City of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> whither they went to
treat, he replyed, to those that would have
counselled him to force the place, That to
gain all <hi>Thessaly,</hi> he would no hazard the life
of one of those Friends. <hi>That Sounds more
of an honest man, then a Politician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hearing of a Bloody battle that had been
fought near <hi>Corinth:</hi> How miserable is <hi>Grecia,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:60557:79"/>
said he, to turn their Weapons against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
since with much lesser numbers then
have been lost, we might have conquered all
<hi>Persia. As much might be said of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He Solicited his Sister to run with her
Chariot in the Olympian Games for the prize,
To make them know, said he, that there was no
thing either great or generous in that exercise.</p>
               <p>He advised <hi>Xenophon</hi> to bring up his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at <hi>Lacedemonia:</hi> To learn the Noblest
of all the Sciences, which is, to command,
and to obey.</p>
               <p>He bestowed several Employments on his
Enemies; to turn, said he, their hatred into
Friendship.</p>
               <p>An Advocate desiring Letters of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
for a Judge that was his Friend: My
Friends, said he, Stand in need of no recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
to make them do Justice.</p>
               <p>Some body shewing him the Fortifications
of a Place, and asking him whether they were
not very fine: yes, for Women, said he.
<hi>Another ask'd, what Women dwell there? and
a third said, there is a very fine apartment for
the Ladies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A celebrated Comedian admiring that he
would not speak to him, and inquiring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he knew him: yes, said he, are not
you <hi>Callippides</hi> the <hi>Buffoon? Because the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians
prized nothing but vertue, otherwise
that profession was not infamous amongst the</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<hi>tho it were prohibited in Lacedemonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When some would perswade him to hear

a fellow that counterfeited the Nightingale:

               <p>A Physician who would be called <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
as who should say, the Saviour, because he
had wrought some famous Cures, having sent
a letter to him with this Inscription, <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
Iupiter, To King</hi> Agesilaus, <hi>Health.
He replyed, King</hi> Agesilaus <hi>to Menecrates,
Wisdome,</hi> treating him as a Fool.</p>
               <p>Some telling him that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
took party with the <hi>Persians:</hi> No, said he,
it is the <hi>Persian</hi> hold Parties with the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians;</hi>
So to those that called the King
of <hi>Persia,</hi> the Great King, as we say at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Grand Siginor, he said, he was not
greater then himself, unless he were more
just; not measuring his greatness by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of his Empire, but of his Vertues.</p>
               <p>Being asked whether Valour were better
then Justice: It would be useless, said he,
if all men were just. <hi>He added, that it would
likewise be of no use, unless accompanied by the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Asia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as free, were nothing worth; but
they were passable for Slaves.</p>
               <p>He said, that we ought to teach Children,
that which would be of use to them when they
are men.</p>
               <p>One making an ill defence for himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judges, yet still imploring the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Laws, In vain doest thou miplore

               </p>
               <p>When the King of <hi>Persia</hi> sought his ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he told him, that were needless, for
if he were a true Friend to his Country, he
should be so to him.</p>
               <p>A Friend of his Surprising him unawares
as he was Sporting with his Children: Stay,
said he, and do no mock, till you have

               </p>
               <p>Such as were allied to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
complaining that they furnished them
with more Souldiers, then themselves raised,
he made it appear that they indeed furnished
them with more men, but not so many Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
because there was not one of them but
had another Trade, whereas the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
practised nothing but the Art of

               <p>Necessity obliging them to do something

               <p>A <hi>Rhetorician</hi> bragging of his Art: doest

had not the courage to approach them. This has
some resemblance with another of an</hi> Athenian, <hi>who
said, they had often repulsed the Lacedemonians
from the Walls of</hi> Athens.</p>
               <p>A Sergeant who was selling of Slaves, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
I have a Lacedemonian to sell: say, a

Doest thou believe, that any other would

               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Leuctres,</hi>

where are the Lacedemonians now? They are

               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:60557:94"/>The <hi>Athenians</hi> having been compelled to
Surrrender to the Lacedemonians, demanded
of them to have the Isle of <hi>Samos</hi> left in their

to let you keep possession of anothers Lands,
when you have not been able to defend your

                  <hi>Philip</hi> sending to know of them, whether
they would have him enter the Country, as
a Friend or a Foe: they answered him neither
as one, nor other.</p>
               <p>Another time they condemned an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

of King to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> altho that Prince had
made a Present of great quantities of Wheat
to the <hi>Spartans</hi> in a time of Famine. <hi>But they

               </p>
               <p>A wicked person having propounded very
good advice upon occasion, they caused him
to be registed as an honest man, that they
might not seem to give countenance to Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons.</p>
               <p>Two Brothers pleading against each other
they raised a Fine upon the Father of them,
for his not deciding that Controversy. A
Musician was likewise condemned, for having
played on the <hi>Lyre</hi> with his Fingers, contrary
to their Custom, because they would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Sparta</hi> to be corrupted with Novelties.</p>
               <p>A little Boy being mortally wounded by
his Camerade; he said to those that cheered
him with the hopes of a revenge; that needs
not, for I had done the same to him,

had I been strong enough.</p>
               <p>Another having stollen a Fox, suffered it
to tear his Bowels, rather then discover his
theft, and said to excuse it, that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Dye, then be taken in an ill act. <hi>It was
permitted to steal, provided they were not taken in
the Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some saying to a Lacedemonian, it was
happy for him, that he had not been met with
by Thieves: But, they are so, said he, for
not meeting with me.</p>
               <p>A Lacedemonian, being Interrogated, what
he could do: Be Free, replyed he. <hi>Or, dye
for my Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Young Lacedemonian Captive, who
served his Master well enough, having order
to bring him his Chamber-pot, answered not;
and being pressed to do it, he made his Escape
to the top of the house, and told him, you
shall quickly find whom you have to deal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and cast himself down, that he might not
do a thing unworthy, or beneath himself.</p>
               <p>Another being asked whether he would be
a good Boy, if they bought him: Yes, said he,
or whether you buy me, or not.</p>
               <p>One being Scoffed at, for having painted
a Fly upon his Buckler, as if he would avoid
being known by so small a token: You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your selves, said he, for I will charge
the Enemy so near, that they shall have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
know this Mark well enough.</p>
               <p>Some having proffered to put a Lyre into
the Hands of a Lacedemonian, after they had
dined, he said, he had no skill in Fooling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:60557:95"/>One inquiring of another, whether it
were safe going to <hi>Lacedemon:</hi> There is no
danger for any but Lyons, said he, for the
Hares sleep at our very Gates, <hi>To shew they
minded not cowards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Lacedemonian mortally wounded at the
first on-set: It does not trouble me to dye,
said he, but to be killed thus basely, before
I had Signalized my courage.</p>
               <p>Another having given some Fish to be dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at an Inn: hearing the Host call, to bring him
some Oyl, Vinegar, and some Cheese to make
the Sauce: If I must have all that, said he,
I shall not need the Fish. <hi>This shews their Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Lysander's</hi> Death, <hi>Agesilaus</hi> having found
among his Papers a Speech concerning the
changing of the form of Government. And
being about to publish it, his Friends told him,
He ought not to Rake <hi>Lysander</hi> out of his
Grave; but rather bury his harangue with him.
<hi>Because it is dangerous to reveal what may hurt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those that were Betroathed to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
refusing to Marry them after his decease,
because he Dyed Poor, the <hi>Ephori</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to pay Fines: Because they had shewed
more regard for Wealth, then for their Faith.</p>
               <p>At their return from a Battle, a Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
being asked, whether those that were
slain were not the bravest Fellows: Death,
said he, must be very cunning to distinguish
between Cowardize and Valour.</p>
               <p>Some admiring the happyness of a Merchant
who had many Vessels: I do not value, said
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60557:95"/>
a Lacedemonian, a happyness exposed to the
mercy of the waves.</p>
               <p>A Lacedemonian beholding his Son brought
home from a Battle, with seven mortal wounds,
and all in Honorable places: I do not weep
for thee, my Son, said he, it is the cowards
should be wept for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> being entred into <hi>Laconia,</hi> some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
said to a Lacedemonian, what will you do
now, poor People? We will dye, replyed
he, for we have not learned to serve. They
answered to the demands that Prince made
them with one word, no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antipater</hi> requiring of the Lacedemonians
Fifty Young men in hostage, they rather chose
it should be Women, or Ancient men, lest
their Youth should be corrupted with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
manners, and when he threatned unless
they would obey him: If thou commandest us,
said they, things worse then Death, we will
rather chuse to dye.</p>
               <p>An Aged man at the Olympick Games run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about every where to find a Seat, no
sooner came near the Lacedemonians quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but all the Young men rose up; which
being observed with great Acclamations:
Great Gods, said he, all the <hi>Grecians</hi> know
what Vertue is; but there are none but the
Lacedemonians that put it in practice. <hi>Aged men
were much Honored and respected amongst them;
whereupon one said pleasantly enough; that it was
an advantage no where but in</hi> Lacedemon <hi>to
grow old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A poor Fellow craving an Almes of a Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian:

He that gave thee the first, said he'
ruined thee. <hi>Because that incouraged his Idleness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One having desired an offering of a Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian;
I do not value those Gods, replyed
he, that are more Beggarly then my self. <hi>Or,
that wants the Assistance of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hearing an Orator very glib in a Discourse:
Great Gods, said he, how fast that Fellow's
Tongue waggs! <hi>Not setting any value on his
Eloquence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another being asked, what he thought of a

of the Poetry of those times.</hi>

offered themselves to Death, to expiate the
crime committed against the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors;
the King being astonished at their
bravery, and intreating them to stay with him:
We cannot, said they, live without those,
for whom we are willing to dye.</p>
               <p>A Lacedemonian not being able to obtain
Audience of a Prince, who excused it, by

               <p>That what it had of most affrightful, was the

               <p>That one should neither desire it, nor fear

               </p>
               <p>That of all things the Ieast ingrateful, was
time; the most obscure, things to come;

               <p>That the half was worth more then the

of guilty Persons, and said, He gave one
to Nature, the other to the Law.</p>
               <p>He said, the worst of wild Beasts, was the
Tyrant, of tame ones the Flatterer.</p>
               <p>That the most difficult to undergo of all

that those that had ever been unfortunate,

               <p>That hope was the most pleasing thing of

               <p>That it was better to be a judge betwixt

               </p>
               <p>That Drunkenness was a lesson for Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p>To one that asked him questions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the State of the Dead after this life, he
said, that he had never been in that Region,
nor had seen any that were returned from
thence.</p>
               <p>He measured Riches by the use one had of
them, and said, that the rest was not only
Superfluous, but incommodious, another add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they were worse then Poverty.</p>
               <p>He said, to a Debauched man that bragged
he had more Scholars then himself, that it
was not so easie to ascend, as to descend.</p>
               <p>Being in company, and receiving the news
of the Death of his Son: Come, said he, let
us go and Bury him. <hi>Without being otherwise
moved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said of a Prince who had expended much
in the building of a Palace, but had been at no
cost to improve himself; that People came
Flocking from all parts to see his House: But
no body was desirous to come to see
him.</p>
               <p>He recommended three things to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
Wisdom, Modesty, and Silence.</p>
               <p>Being witness of the Massacre made by the
thirty Tyrants, he said to a Philosopher:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60557:108"/>
Let us comfort our selves that we are not like
the great ones, the Subject of Tragedies.</p>
               <p>His Wife finding fault with him that he
had refused <hi>Alcibiades</hi>'s Presents: I have,
said he, my Ambition, as well as he hath
his.</p>
               <p>He said, there was no better Inheritance,
then a good Friend.</p>
               <p>Some body treating ill his Servant before
him: Hast thou never taken notice, said he,
that thou art more Guilty then he? <hi>Some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
is to</hi> Diogenes.</p>
               <p>A man followed by a little Servant, who
carryed his Cloaths, complaining of his weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
Art thou not ashamed, said he, to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
then a Child?</p>
               <p>Against those that amused themselves in
Fruitless and curious Studies, he quoted a
Verse of <hi>Homer,</hi> where it is enquired what
they do at home, and said, that those things
that are above us, concerns us not. <hi>He meant
the Heavens, and the Constellations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When his Friends were concerned, that he
having saluted another, the other did not
return his Salutation: Wherefore should I
be angry, because another is not so Civil as
my self, said he?</p>
               <p>He said, that Sumptuous Cloaths were only
fit to Act Tragedies in.</p>
               <p>Of a man that loved to contend, he said,
He could not live amongst honest good natured
men, but ought to wast his days in Solitude.</p>
               <p>Some body complaining that every thing
was very dear at <hi>Athens,</hi> he made it apparent,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60557:108"/>
Leading him round the City, that there was
nothing dear but Superfluities.</p>
               <p>He would not accept the Presents of a Prince
because he could not return him the like, nor
would he go to wait upon him, that he might
not trouble his quiet, nor lose his Liberty.</p>
               <p>Saying one day to his Friends, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from a Fair, that if he had had Money,
he would have bought him a Cloak, they all
proffered him some: But too late, said <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi>
for they should have prevented the shame
of asking for it.</p>
               <p>One saying, his Travels had done him no
good; that is, said he, because you Travelled
always with your self.</p>
               <p>He commanded <hi>Xenophon</hi> to follow him:
To learn, said he, a Science which he Ignores,
which is to make a good man. <hi>Or, to make
man good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Walking in the Morning, he said, he was
preparing a relishing Sauce for his Dinner.
<hi>Because it begets an appetite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He called good Fame, the perfume of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
because it ever follows and makes a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sweetness.</p>
               <p>To a Young man who was silent, he said,
speak that I may see thee.</p>
               <p>He believed Woman to be as capable of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
as man, contrary to <hi>Aristotles</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who holds her for a less perfect Animal.</p>
               <p>Having adorned himself more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to dine with the Fair <hi>Agathon,</hi> said he,
we must make our selves Handsome, to go to
the Handsome. <hi>However he was very ill-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60557:109"/>
and resembled the Pictures of the</hi> Silenes,
<hi>who are Painted flat-Nosed and great-Belly'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Feeling a pleasing itch, when they took off
his Chains, he said, that Pleasure was the
Daughter of Pain, <hi>Or, rather that the one begot
the other, by turns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before he Drank off the Poyson, he asked
the Executioner, as they ask a Doctor before
they take Physick, what he must do afterwards,
and said, he was going to be delivered from
all his troubles.</p>
               <p>When he was told, he ought to preserve
himself for his Children, and for his Friends,
he said, God would provide for his Children:
And for his Friends, he should find others
in the Regions whither he was going, or at
least, it would not be very long 'ere he should
see them there.</p>
               <p>A man well Skilled in Physiognomy, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and addicted to Drunkenness, he replyed,
that it was true, he had an Inclination to those
Vices; but that he had corrected himself by
his Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristippus</hi> having sent him some Money
which he had earned by teaching, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it back again, saying that all things were

               </p>
               <p>As he was treating a Friend, his Wife hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thrown down the Table, and that Friend
rising to be gone; your Hen did as much at

               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:60557:109"/>These are some of his Sentences.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That it was no small matter to begin well,
tho that were little valved.</p>
               <p>That it was very imprudent to separate the
useful from the honest, as if any thing could
be really useful that is not honest. <hi>Or, that
dishonours us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Young People ought to do nothing to
excess.</hi> This is a mark of Wisdom: But not of
a great Genius, which runs on with great ardour
to all it does undertake.</p>
               <p>That great care was taken to make a Picture
that resembled, but we had none to resemble
the Deity, in whose Image we were made:
That we trickt up our self in a Looking-glass,
and did not a dorn our selves in Vertues habit.
<hi>This is a little varied from</hi> Plutarch.</p>

               <p>Being asked what Philosophy had taught
him: To live well with all the World, said
he. <hi>Or, to speak freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said, to those that reproved him for
treating himself too Magnificently. That if
it were a fault, it would not be practised at the
Feasts of their Gods. Plato <hi>reproving him for
the same thing, he asked him, why he did not do
it to</hi> Denys <hi>the Tyrant? But there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwen a Prince and a Philosopher, and a day
of Feasting, and an ordinary Meal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said, that the Wise would live well, tho
there were no Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Denys</hi> the Tyrant, having told him, in a
way of reproach, that Philosophers were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
seen at the Gates of great men; But that
great men were not seen at the Doors of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers:
That is, said he, because Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
know what they want, but great men
do not know it. Another time he said, that
it was as we see Physicians at their Patients
Doors.</p>
               <p>He said there was as great a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Fool and a Wise man, as between a
Horse that was managed, and another that
was not.</p>
               <p>One of his Scholars being scandaliz'd to
see him go into a naughty House: The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
replyed he, is not in going in, but in
not being able to come out again. <hi>As much
as to say, that nothing is blameable in pleasures,
but excess.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:60557:113"/>He said, that it were better to be poor then
Ignorant; because knowledge is a Treasure
far more precious then Riches.</p>
               <p>Retiring from one that spoke injuriously of
him, and the other crying, wherefore doest
thou fly: Because thou art used, said he, to
speak ill, and I am not used to hear it. <hi>There
is somewhat like this of</hi> Cato.</p>
               <p>One asking him wherefore he seemed to
be more affrighted then others were in a storm:
It is, replyed he, because I have more to lose.
<hi>That is to say, a man of Worth runs a greater
risque then a Fool, because the loss is greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said, to one who vapoured of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much, or, of having read much: It is
not those that eat most are the Fattest nor
most healthful, but those that have the best
digestion, <hi>Or, that eat the best meats.</hi>

               <p>An Advocate that pleaded for him, having
gained his Cause, and saying to him, by way
of reproach: Wherein hath <hi>Socrates</hi> done

what you have said of me, was truth.</p>
               <p>Thus one asking him to what end he would
have his Son Study: To the end, said he,
that being set in the Theater, it may not be
a Stone upon a Stone. <hi>Or, one block upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

for the need he had of it; but to teach them
thereby what use they were to make of it.</p>

of such a one, naming some-body, <hi>Out of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,

               </p>
               <p>Treating some Strangers, and finding there
was no Bread, when they were sitting down

               <p>He said, that Poverty, like <hi>Vlysses</hi> his

               </p>
               <p>That there were many diseased, where there

               <p>It being said, that from other Sects, they
passed to that of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> but from the

a Capon one can never make a Cock.</p>
               <p>Having the Gout, <hi>Carneades</hi> would needs
leave him alone to bemoan himself in quiet:
Stay, said he, for what pain soever my Feet

               </p>
               <p>To dissuade from Marriage, he was wont
to say, that an ill favoured one made the
Heart ake, and a beautiful one, the Head.
<hi>By reason of Iealousie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Speaking of Riches, he said, that we ought
not to value things bestowed by Chance,
kept by Vice, and confounded or squandred
away by Virtue. <hi>By the first is meant Fortune,
the second Covetousness, the third Liberality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He compared those in high Offices, to men
walking on the Ice, who are ever in danger of
falling.</p>
               <p>He said, old Age was the Harbour of all

Miseries. <hi>Either because all mischiefs flow into
it: Or, because it brings Death that puts an end
to all. Or, the safest harbour is the Grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it was a great Misfortune, not to be
able to undergo Misfortune.</p>
               <p>That Fame was the Mother of Time. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it makes a man live, after he is dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the way to Hell was very easie, since
it is found out Blindfold. <hi>He meant the

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He called Beauty, other Folks goods,</hi> Because
one is not properly Beautiful to ones self, but to
others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He said, Money was the Sinews of business.</hi>
It is said to be the Sinews of War, because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made without money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Impiety was the Enemy of Assurance.</hi>
In <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> 'tis said, nothing is so fearful, as
an ill Conscience: This relates to the same.</p>
               <p>Being siezed on together with some
Thieves, we are lost, cryed they, if they
know us: And I, said he, if they do not know
us. <hi>A good man hath as much interest to be known,
as a Knave to be conceal'd.</hi>

               <p>Of a Covetous Wretch he said<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He said, that Prudence was the Eye of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and served for Valour in Old men, as
Valour for Prudence in the Young. <hi>Because
the first exempts old men from danger, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:60557:119"/>That one should Honor old Age, because

good ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of a Melancholly Envious Wretch he said,
one cannot well guess whether any ill be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to him, or any good to others.</p>
               <p>He would have one be assured they have
profited in Vertues School, when they did any

                  <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aristotle.</note> said, that one gained nothing by
lying, but the reputation of not being believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when one spake truth.</p>
               <p>Giving an Alms to a wicked man, he said,
that he did not give to the Person, but to
Nature, whose infirmities requires relief.
<hi>In the Greek it is, not to the manners, but to the
man; however I find it in others as I have put
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said, the mind was Enlightned by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the Eye, by the Air that surrounds it.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Athenians</hi> had invented the Law,

had quitted the one to exercise the other.</p>
               <p>That the Roots of Sciences were bitter, but
the Fruits were sweet.</p>

               <p>That Beauty was a great letter of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:

               <p>That Knowledge differed from Ignorance;

               <p>That Envy is the Attendant on Fortune.</p>
               <p>That we ought not to regard from what

               <p>Hearing some body abused him in words
when he was absent; let him beat me too,

               <p>He lived in a Tun, under the Portico of a

               <p>Seeing <hi>Plato</hi> eating Olives at a Feast: To

And derided those <hi>Grammarians,</hi> who found

               <p>That to happy People, life was Sweet
and Death dreadful; but to a Tyrant, both
the one and the other was insupportable.</p>

               <p>That the way to be Revenged of ones

               <p>An Ambassador reproaching the <hi>Thebans</hi>
with <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and the <hi>Argiens</hi> with <hi>Orestes:</hi>
It is true, said <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> they were Born
amongst us, but we drove them hence, and you
entertained them.</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians extending to great
length, their accusations against the <hi>Thehans:</hi>
How I am troubled, said he, that for our sakes
you have left off speaking Laconically. <hi>That is
to say, briefly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Prince promising the <hi>Athenians</hi> to help
them to meat for little or nothing, because he
intended to Plunder the Enemy of all: And
we will boyl it for nothing, said <hi>Epaminondas,</hi>
for we will set Fire all about.</p>
               <p>One that was not very Fortunate in his own
Marriage, advising him to Marry: In that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
he, I shall hardly take your Counsel,
<hi>Or, follow your Example.</hi> He added, That a

might be the Bolder to dye for his Countries
Service.</p>
               <p>Of a man that dyed during the time the
Battle of <hi>Leuctres</hi> was fought, he said, he
wondered he could have leasure to dye in a

               <p>
                  <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> said to a Thief who objected

that his discourses smelt of the Lamp, <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Study and Labour:</hi> I know, said he, that you

time. And to a Prodigal Fellow who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
all his own Estate, and found the same
fault: You know that Oyl hath cost you more
then ever it did me. <hi>Meaning his Gaming by
Night, as the other Studyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Archias</hi> who had been a <hi>Comedian,</hi>
advised him, to forsake the Temple wherein
he had Sheltred himself, and put himself
into <hi>Antipater's</hi> hands: He told him, he was
no better an Orator, then he had been a
Comedian; and that as he had never satisfyed
him in one of his Qualities, he should never
persuade him in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Romulus</hi> having Drank but very little at a

dear, for every one would Drink his fill. <hi>Or, as
much as he could.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Flaminius</hi> having sent to demand an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view

refusing to come without Hostages, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
he was alone, whereas the Romans
had many other Generals; I know he is left

               </p>
               <p>He said of <hi>Philopemen,</hi> who had great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Horse and Foot, but had no money to
pay them, that he had Arms and Legs, but
wanted a Belly. <hi>That which made this raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Censor</hi> making a harangue against
the Luxury of great Tables, said, He knew
not how to make himself be understood, or
heard, because the Belly hath no Ears. He
added, that he marvelled how a City could
subsist, where they sold a Fish for more then
an Ox.</p>
               <p>Jesting upon a Debauched Person, who
had eaten up all his Inheritance which lay along

what that had spared.</p>
               <p>It being debated with much heat in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
whether they should send back all the

make all this bustle to know whether these

               <p>A Roman who had Written their History
in Greek, desiring pardon if he had not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

               </p>
               <p>Of three Ambassadors, whereof one was

               <p>A Magistrate suspected to have Poysoned

               <p>One that carryed a piece of Timber which

               <p>Of a Woman who had a lewd Debauched
