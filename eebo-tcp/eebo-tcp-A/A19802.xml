            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14435:4"/>
are ledde by the Spirite of God, and haue his feare before their eyes.</p>
                  <p>For when Infidelles and vnbeleeuers doe ioyne together in conſent about any matter among themſelues, they doe it either for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, hyre and gayne ſake: or els for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate pleaſures: or finally, for their aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and honours ſake: all which endes are moſt farre from true <hi>Friendſhippe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ſay) it can be among none others, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely ſuch, as be godly and faithful, and feare the Lord effectually.

Wherein we muſt firſt note the diſtinction and difference that is made betweene <hi>fauourable goodwill</hi> called <hi>Beneuolentia:</hi> and perfect <hi>Friendſhip</hi> tearmed <hi>Amicitia.</hi> For a <hi>fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable goodwill</hi> is that, when men being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent one from an other, yea, which neuer ſawe one an other, doe yet heartily loue one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, drawne thereunto by a kinde of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue, or ſome notable and ſingular gift of God, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one doth perceiue, eſpye and knowe to bee reſiaunt in the other. So, when as Paule had as yet neither ſeene Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Gala. 1.18.19.</note> Iames, nor Iohn, yet did he loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and this kind of loue, was this <hi>fauourable good

                  <p>But <hi>Friendſhip</hi> requireth both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, the ſight, and the familiar conuerſation of friends together amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is onely among them, which are either daiely conuerſaunt one with an other: or els ſuch as haue aforetyme liued long tyms toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, familiar conuerſation, and frequent companie keeping, encreaſeth (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe ſaith) this friendſhip, and ſowdreth men together in this indiſſoluble agreement of myndes. Now, <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is ſuch a kinde of loue and inwarde affection, as that there can not poſſiblie be any greater, and vnto which, there cannot any thing be either added or put vnto more. It requireth therefore a mutuall frequentation and familiar conuerſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby our goodwill, liking and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vſually encreaſed, ſtrengthened, and made greater. In this ſorte was that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip betweene <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the firſt occaſioned and begun, namely, by that their domeſticall and familiar conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation at home in <hi>Saules</hi> houſe: but was alſo thereby much encreaſed and furthered.<note place="margin">1.

(which I ſpeake of) or at leaſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.9.</note> this often mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and conference together, doth feede (as it were) this newe kindled fier or flame of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which burneth alike in the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of either partie.</p>

But if this abſence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuaunce be long deferred, protracted or delayed: or if this Friendſhip were not at the beginning well and throughly ſettled and grounded, then truely (ſuch is the fickle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and inconſtancie of the worlde now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies) it is wont commonly either to ſlyde quite away and take his leaue, or at leaſt to waxe cold, and not to haue ſuch great heates
<pb facs="tcp:14435:6"/>
and deſires as before. For Ariſtotle ſaith, and that very truely, <hi>Silence and abſence diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth many friendſhips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is therefore this true and Chriſtian <hi>Friendſhip</hi> whereof wee now ſpeake? Many men doe bring many reaſons, whereby they goe about (if not altogether and plainly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate and at large to diſplaye, yet at leaſt wiſe) to depaynt and ſomewhat to ſhadow out the force and nature thereof. Some therfore define it with too large circumſtaunces, and ſome againe, hemme it in within too narrowe a compaſſe. For they which ſay, that <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
is a conſent of mindes in all cauſes and all matters whatſoeuer, doe not well aduiſe themſelues, what they ſay: for that, they doe ſtretch the force of <hi>Friendſhippe</hi> further then they ought to doe. For, there may bee many things, wherein two men or moe doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies agree together in one, but be of diuers and ſundrie opinions. As namely, they may at ſome tymes agree together to doe ſome good thing, and oftentymes againe, they may conſult together to do ſome things naughtie and wicked: So that in ſuch a caſe, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of mindes in them ought rather to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a ſecrete compact, a whiſpering aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, or a cloſe conference, rather then true
<pb facs="tcp:14435:7"/>
and ſtedfaſt <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> For they that ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> that they make it to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of goodme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among themſelues, touching their priuate affayres and dealings onely, doe make of <hi>Friendſhippe</hi> as it were a kinde of Merchandize.</p>
                  <p>But wee doe thinke that <hi>Friendſhip</hi> may very well be thus defined, if wee ſay, that it is a Pact or Couenaunt made betweene two perſons, (God himſelfe beeing called to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) wherein they faithfully promiſe, th'one to th'other, mutually to loue, cheriſh, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly to conſerue, protect, maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one the others perſon, eſtate, and goods, ſo farre foorth as it may lawfully bee done, without breach of God his lawe, or diſhonour to his worde. Which definition being parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly examined, ſhal the better appeare, and be found to carie in it the more certaintie and trueth. Hierome in his 5. Epiſtle doth thus define it: <hi>Friendſhippe</hi> is a mutuall loue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in the mynde, and a ſtrong linking of the harts together, chaſt, ſincere, and without emulation.</p>
                  <p>And firſt it is called a <hi>Pact</hi> or <hi>Couenant,</hi> becauſe in Friendſhippe this ſeemeth to be a thing thereunto ſingularlie and peculiarlie appropriate, that there is alwaies betweene
<pb facs="tcp:14435:7"/>
faithfull vowed Louers, a certaine bargaine or agreement ſolemnely made. So did <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
and <hi>Dauid</hi> agree and conſent betwene themſelues, making a Couenaunt betweene them, and that not only once, but many times renewed and repeated. For,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.3. &amp;. 20.8. &amp;. 17. &amp; 23 18. 1. Cor. 1.10.</note> as loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie doth generally commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and will euery one of vs to bee knit together in a moſt firme conſent of myndes and agreement of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo ſpecially &amp; namely in true <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> it is among Friends moſt chiefly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that their faithfull hearts and true affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may not bee ſmoothered in ſecrecie, or kept vnknowne, but be apparaunted, made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>For, ſuch is the force and efficacie of this loue and affection which knitteth and linketh them together, that it will not in any wiſe bee hidd, but will breake foorth into open ſhewe. Wherby it commeth to paſſe, that the one vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth and teſtifieth to the other, what affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raigneth in him, and what deſire he hath to bee loued againe of the other, whom he ſo ardently fauoureth. Among other kindes of men, the mutuall goodwill that one beareth to an other may many tymes be kept ſecrete and vnuttered: But betweene Friends it can not in any caſe ſo be. Therefore they doe vſe
<pb facs="tcp:14435:8"/>
this teſtification of their mutual affection and will, as it were, the liuely voyce of both their hearts, and the firmer bond and ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe for perpetuitie and continuaunce.</p>
                  <p>Now, the name of <hi>God</hi> is vſed, and in this caſe called to witneſſe, becauſe he is the true Author and very Fountaine of al firme, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſtedfaſt <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> without whom no maner of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> can be good, godlie, or comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable. For a higher, greater, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier or ſurer witneſſe, pledge, or token, of their inward minde and will, then God himſelf is, can they haue none: and therefore doe they reuerently in this behalf, and for this purpoſe call him as Witneſſe to their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience and proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And what better witneſſe of their profeſſed promiſe can they bring then God himſelfe? Whoſe name or authoritie can they vſe, that can and wil more ſeuerely and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh their breach and contempt, then he? For, their deſire and wiſhe is, that the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, pact, league, promiſe, vowe, proteſtation agreeement and conſent ſo betweene them mutually made, and enterchaungeablie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and taken, ſhould not be for a tyme but for euer: not momentanie, but perpetuall: not fleeting and fading, but permanent and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For this intent therefore (I ſay) doe they
<pb facs="tcp:14435:8"/>
vſe and enterpoſe the name of <hi>God,</hi> building their matters vpon him, who is the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt foundation. And thus doe we reade that <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> knit their <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> &amp; made their couenaunt before the Lord.<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>It is further alſo written of the ſame <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> that he gaue vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> as a pledge, bonde or pawne of their newe begon <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe,</hi> not onely the ſolemne cyting of the name of God, but alſo other viſible giftes and outward teſtifications, to wit, his Robe,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 18.3.</note> Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, Sword, Bowe, and ſuch other garments and furniture, as at that tyme he had: for ſuch heartie curteſies maketh men, not onely the mindfuller, but alſo more religious keepers and obſeruers of their promiſe and couenant.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid in the definition to be <hi>betweene</hi> two: becauſe neuer or very ſeldome is firme and faſt <hi>Friendſhip</hi> among moe then twaine. And therefore for the preſeruing of it ſtable, ſtedfaſt and vnuiolated, there muſt not a third be taken into this knot of true <hi>Friendſhippe.</hi> Now, whereas it is written of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> King of <hi>Sicile,</hi> that he earneſtly requeſted to be taken into the perfect bond of ſincere ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie together with <hi>Damon</hi> &amp; <hi>Pythias,</hi> it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing againſt this our ſaying. For, there was no ſuch nere coniunction of mynds
<pb facs="tcp:14435:9"/>
with him, as was betweene them two them ſelues, the one with the other: but it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an admiration of that moſt rare <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and ſurpaſſing goodwill of men among themſelues: which vnto a moſt mightie King ſeemed admirable, happie and entierly to bee wiſhed for, and which alſo ſeemed farre ſafer and bleſſedder then that his royall eſtate and condition. So were <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> friendes together, being but onely two. For, <hi>Friendſhip</hi> betweene moe then two, groweth out of eſtimation, looſeth of his dignitie and price, is contemned and leſſe accoumpted of, and in trueth forfaiteth his wonted force and proper vertue.</p>
                  <p>It followeth in the definition: <hi>Of mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly louing, defending, cheriſhing, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning one an other.</hi> For theſe be the very chiefeſt and principalleſt effects of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> that ſuch as bee true friendes in deede, muſt mutually loue one the other, and that not faynedlie and clokedlie, but euen truely and ſincerely: and becauſe of ſuch their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinceritie and true loue, they doe alſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually defend, cheriſh, maintaine and protect one an other.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, there is added in the definition: <hi>ſo farte foorth as may lawfully bee done

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, ſuch men as holde opinion that there is herein a repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, doe alledge two reaſons: The one is, The generall Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8</note> wherby we are charged to loue one an other. Now, if it bee lawfull for ſome particular perſons to contract within them ſelues a kinde of more ſtreict and nere amitie then with others, then thinke they, that this generall Rule of louing all men indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is tranſgreſſed and broken.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond reaſon is this: Our dueties, (commaunded and enioyned vnto vs in that generall Commaundement of <hi>Loue</hi>) ought to bee ſo great towards all men, yea towards our very Enemies, that greater, better, or faithfuller can there not, ne poſſiblie ought there to be ſhewed vnto thoſe, whom wee call and tearme <hi>Friendes.</hi> What force or effect then (ſay they) is there in this ſingular and ſpeciall goodwill, mutuall agreement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Friendſhippe onely betwene ſome two,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.44.</note>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14435:10"/>
and no moe? By theſe two Arguments they thinke this ſame neere bond, infringible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, firme loue and ſingular force of ſpeciall <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is encountred and taken away: becauſe it maketh vs (ſay they) the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, negligent and ſlacke to loue, ayde, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and relieue others, which are not ſo faſtlie ioyned in heart vnto vs: &amp; becauſe thereupon wee haue more minde to pleaſe and benefite thoſe whom we haue ſpecially choſen for our deare and neere Friends: letting all others (in a maner) to paſſe by, without any helpe at our handes at all.</p>
                  <p>For anſwere whereunto, we ſay,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> that there be other, and the ſame moſt ſtrong and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Arguments to confirme, approue, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and warrant this ſpeciall kinde of entier Amitie among men: prouing the ſame to bee to the godlie not onely lawful and allowable, but alſo honeſt, lawdable and neceſſarie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the authoritie of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which teacheth vs that wee ought to loue ſuch as wee admit and receiue into our inward Friendſhip. And therfore the Spirite of GOD, thundreth out threates,<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.9. Pſal. 55.21 Iſaiah. 3.5. Mic. 7.5.6. Eccl. 22.25</note> commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and puniſhments againſt violaters and breakers of this inward amitie and profeſſion of ſpeciall Loue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14435:11"/>Secondly, the example of godly men, who both publiquely and priuately haue ſundrie tymes ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nely entred into, &amp; religiouſly with mutuall conſent profeſſed this neere &amp; ſtrict bond of Amitie. Which deede and purpoſe of theirs, God himſelf both praiſeth and alſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame forth vnto vs, as a patterne to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.3. &amp;. 19.1.</note> In this ſorte were <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> lincked together in a moſt firme bonde of perfect <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> And thoſe couenants which among Kinges and Princes and high Eſtates are called <hi>Leagues,</hi> are among pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons tearmed <hi>Amitie.</hi> But <hi>Leagues</hi> are allowable and warrantable by the lawe of God:<note place="margin">1. Kin. 4.5.</note> And therfore <hi>Amitie</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Nature her ſelf: together with the common ſpeach and ſettled opinion of al Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for there is no people but highly extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the vertue of Frendſhip, and hath deuiſed notable ſentences of praiſe in condemnation thereof: as namely this: <hi>Wee haue no leſſe neede for the vſe of this life of Friendſhip, then we haue of water and fier.</hi> Notablie and excellently is the ſame diſcourſed vpon, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto vs in their learned works, both by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> And it is the common receiued opinion and vſuall tearme
<pb facs="tcp:14435:11"/>
of Nature, &amp; of all people of the world gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie: againſt the which, whoſoeuer reſiſteth and againe ſaieth, ſpeaketh euen againſt his owne Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Finally, theſe former Arguments of the againſayers, are vnſufficient and prooue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: becauſe they may both of them be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered and quickly confuted. As firſt, I ſay and anſwere that (by entring into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hearty and inward friendſhip with ſome one particuler perſon) the generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement and Precept of almightie God is neither hindred nor taken away. For, God himſelf who teacheth vs to loue all men, hath (notwithſtanding) by his Lawe appoynted certaine degrees of Loue, for vs to followe, whereby wee are to loue ſome more tenderly and dearely then other ſome. For, he willeth vs not to yeeld alike and equall loue vnto all men indifferently and without reſpect:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.24. Mat. 19.5. Ephe. 5.25. Col. 3.20. Gal. 6.10.</note> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, wee are commaunded to loue our wife more then our parents: our Children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue Straungers: and them which bee of the houſhold of Faith, more then Infidels. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore in reſpect of conſanguinitie, kindred and proximitie of bloud, it is lawfull for vs to make a difference, by louing our nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friendes more ardently and with greater
<pb facs="tcp:14435:12"/>
affection then others: and to diſcerne betwene the inwarde heartie loue which wee beare to them, and the common generall loue which vniuerſallie we beare to all others: why may wee not alſo bee allowed the ſame, in reſpect of our vowed promiſe, ſworne couenant and profeſſed Amitie? And our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.20. &amp;. cha. 13.23.</note> being the patterne of all true Loue, is ſaied to haue loued <hi>Iohn</hi> aboue all the reſt of his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond Argument is vaine, and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous. They demaund this queſtion: what is there left for any ſpeciall Friendſhip, when as all men in generall (yea our very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) ought of vs to be vnfaynedly loued? To whom let this briefly ſuffice for anſwere: that albeit we loue all, and ſhewe our ſelues ready and willing to helpe, relieue and defend all: yet be ſome more ſpecially commended vnto our care then other ſome. Therfore the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and fayreſt fruite of Loue, is this noble vertue <hi>Friendſhip.</hi>

                  <p>THE common &amp; vulgar ſorte of men ioyne together in friendſhip, one with an other
<pb facs="tcp:14435:12"/>
for many conſiderations and for ſundry endes &amp; purpoſes. For either they knit themſelues in league together in reſpect of ſome priuate gayne, commoditie and profite that the one hopeth to reape by the other: or els for ſome reſpect of pleaſure: or finally becauſe they ſeeke thereby to attaine ſome preferment ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, dignitie, praiſe or countenaunce. The true Chriſtian friend of whom we here ſpeake is farre from any of theſe endes: neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth he any of all theſe aforeſayd purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but his chiefe and principall drift is, that in this his <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> God ſpecially may be truely honored, and his Neighbour vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued. For, this onely thing doe al the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpecially care for, and this marke doe they in the whole courſe of their loue chiefly ayme and ſhoote at.</p>
                  <p>But as there may be aſſigned many endes and ſcopes wherefore <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is ſought for and concluded among men: ſo is there one ſpeciall, and (as it were) a proper, chiefe and peculiar ende thereof. And that is this: looke whome GOD hath adorned and bleſſed with ſome ſpeciall giftes aboue others, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mooued vs to haue the ſame partie for his rare qualities in admiration, vnto ſuch an one doe we willingly adioyne our ſelues, and
<pb facs="tcp:14435:13"/>
with him deſire wee moſt gladly to enter into entier familiaritie.</p>
                  <p>The firſt meanes therefore, that firmely knitteth this moſte friendly agreement of mindes together, is the will of God, which mooueth and draweth our hearts ſo to doe. And next is the admiration of the rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and ſingular giftes, which we ſee in an other: in ſo much that we earneſtly deſire (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſame) to bee in his companie, to haue his vnfained loue, and to ſtand aſſuredly in his fauour. And becauſe we commonly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and moſt eſpecially loue thoſe vertues, wherein wee chiefly take moſt delight, and whereunto we feele in our ſelues by God his good gift, ſome ſparkes and inclinations: it commeth therfore to paſſe thereby, that there is ſeene in thoſe that enter into this faſt bond of friendſhip, a ſimilitude and likeneſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and affections, the one with the other: and that being thus linked together, they doe (by a certaine inwarde teſtimonie and ſecrete iudgement) retaine one and the ſame conſent in all things, and ſtill iumpe together in one opinion.</p>
                  <p>This third cauſe therefore for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and piecing of firme and true <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> is of moſt excellent force, and beareth
<pb facs="tcp:14435:13"/>
moſt effectuall ſway, I meane, the ſimilitude of maners, and like delight in ſtudies and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. For, to will and iuſt alike, (that is to ſay, what the one willeth, the other to will the ſame: and what the other nilleth, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be alike affected,) is firme and ſtedfaſt <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> Friendes therefore commonly take delight in thinges alike, and chiefly for the moſt parte frame themſelues by natures conduction and inclination, vnto the loue and ſtudie of one and the ſelfe ſame vertue.</p>
                  <p>The firſt foundation therefore of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> is grounded vpon likenes of ſtudies and ſimilitude of maners. For, in that we hope to be defended, maintained and protected by our friendes: in that, we our ſelues deſire to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and admirable to the good and godly: in that, finally we ſeeke a faithfull companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and helper, vnto whome to impart our whole deuiſes and counſailes, all theſe are rather effects of true <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> then ends thereof. Certes, in that firme and faſt agreement of mynds betweene <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> there was none other ſcope or ende reſpected, then this which we here mention.</p>

                  <head>The ſixt Chapter. Of the effects of true Friendſhip.</head>
                  <p>THere bee three eſpeciall effects of true <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> to witte, mutuall loue in God: an holie conſent of myndes: and an interchaungeable or reciprocall defence, maintenaunce, aſſiſtaunce and protection one of an other to the vttermoſt of abilitie and power.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as touching <hi>Loue:</hi> It is an affection of the heart, by the which wee eſpecially loue ſome one, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others: wiſhing vnto him
<pb facs="tcp:14435:14"/>
all welfare and proſperous ſucceſſe. And this <hi>Loue</hi> is called <hi>Dilectio,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, <hi>Delectio,</hi> which ſignifieth a choyſe or an elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; culling out: &amp; the word <hi>Diligere</hi> to loue, is ſo named of an other like worde <hi>Deligere,</hi> which ſignifieth to pick or chooſe out: becauſe that party who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we tenderly loue, we ſpecially pick and chooſe out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among all others, and haue a ſpeciall care and deſire for his well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proſperitie more then for all others beſides. Therefore we loue all men in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, but we tenderly and affectionatly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace but fewe, or but ſome one onely, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture none at all. For there is a greater vehemencie, and a more effectuall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this word <hi>Diligere,</hi> then there is in the word <hi>Amare,</hi> although <hi>to loue</hi> be the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation both of the one and the other: which difference is wel noted by that moſt eloquent <hi>Marcus Cicero</hi> in one of his familiar Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, written to <hi>Paetus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby wee may ſee, that force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not the way to procure and knit firme <hi>Friendſhip</hi> betweene parties: nor yet feare: but rather a free choyſe of the mynde, and an hartie good liking toward ſome peculiar per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vpon whom (God ſo diſpoſing our heart) wee franklie and in full meaſure beſtowe the
<pb facs="tcp:14435:15"/>
whole zeale of our entier fauour. For, a man that enrolleth himſelfe once in the Regiſter of a perfect and ſincere friend, doth ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and dearely loue his friend, that he euen accoumpteth and acknowledgeth him, as an other himſelfe: and wiſheth no better in any reſpect to himſelfe, then he doth vnto that his newe choſen Friend. For, if there ſhould bee allowed neuer ſo little difference herein, the name of <hi>Frendſhippe</hi> were vtterly gone and quight quayled, and might no longer enioye that title:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de tragib.</note> as the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> no leſſe elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently then truely hath ſet downe.</p>
                  <p>For, ſuch is the force of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> that whenſoeuer a man wiſheth any better happe to himſelf, then he doth to his friend, it by &amp; by ceaſſeth and dyeth. And ſuch effect doth this Loue worke in the mynds of faithful frendes, that the one reioyceth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proſperous eſtate and welfare of the other: and contrariwiſe, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth and is greatly greeued at his miſhap and aduerſitie: euen as wee ſee, came to paſſe in <hi>Ionathan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 20. verſ 34. &amp;. 41.</note> who greatly ſorowed at the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie and affliction of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Yea, ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the force of this Loue and coniunction of myndes, that they weepe together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce together.</p>
                  <p>Finally, when a man is faithfully profeſſed
<pb facs="tcp:14435:15"/>
in this league of ſincere and true <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> he preferreth and more eſteemeth his friende then he doth any other whomſoeuer: and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto him a farre greater affection and zeale then to all other men, (for ſo ſeemed <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> to preferre his deare friende <hi>Dauid</hi> before his owne naturall father) ſo farre forth as Gods glorie is not thereby eclipſed, nor his holy will and commaundement wilfully tranſgreſſed. For, he be wrayed and opened his fathers ſecrete counſell vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and tried out by deuiſes, what his fathers purpoſe ſayinges and meaninges were toward him: yea,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 20.4. &amp;. 9.</note> this <hi>Ionathan</hi> feared not a whit to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him ſuch practiſes as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſounded to the ſhame and reproach of his owne father King <hi>Saule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſo vehement mutuall Loue, breedeth likewiſe among friendes a mutuall conſent and an holy agreement of mynds in al things yea, it ingendreth alſo betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſweete pleaſure and lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging deſire of the one toward the other. And the further that they bee aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by diſtaunce of place, the more ardently do they deſire and long the one for the other: as it were, one entier Soule, being ſeparated and vehemently deſiring the other halfe of it ſelfe being abſent. Finally, the neerer they be
<pb facs="tcp:14435:16"/>
together, the more is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flame of their inward mutuall affection inkindled, and through dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerſing together, is ſtill made ſweeter, and pleaſaunter.</p>
                  <p>This kinde of vehement Affection is not lightly ſeene among any other perſons: for it commonly falleth out, that this daily conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and frequent familiaritie together, breedeth and ſoweth among them either flat hatred, or at leaſt apparant contempt. But betweene Frendes it is the meanes that bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and tyeth them the ſurer and the faſter together. For, their naturall diſpoſitions ſo rightly agree together, that what the one thinketh good, the other thinketh not amiſſe: and in all things they commonly retaine one and the ſelfe ſame iudgement, ſtriuing within themſelues, whether of them may ſurmount and ouercome the other in curteſies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites.</p>
                  <p>They drawe moreouer in one equall yoke, they haue one will, one minde, one purpoſe and meaning, whereby their mutuall conſent in all reſpects is not onely inuiolably conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but alſo much the more encreaſed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no iarring, no diſſenſion, no brawling, no chyding, no contention, no fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ouerthwarting betweene them that be
<pb facs="tcp:14435:16"/>
friendes in deede: but the one beareth with the other: the one yeeldeth to the other: in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of honour the one goeth before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the one not ſo wedded to his opinion, but that he ſuffreth himſelf to be eaſily perſuaded or diſſuaded by the other, ſo farre as the honor of God is not thereby any way empayred or emblemiſhed.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt effect of true <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> is the interchangeable curteſie, defence, protection, aſſiſtaunce, ayde, maintenance and conſeruation to the very vttermoſt of abilitie and power, of one Friend for an other: with no leſſe care for his preſeruation, ſafetie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, commoditie, and all other benefites whatſoeuer, both touching himſelfe, and alſo all them that depend vpon him.</p>
                  <p>For, if by that ſocietie &amp; loue which ought to bee betweene all the godlie among them ſelues, we accoumpt thoſe that by nature are ioyned and lincked vnto vs as our owne, and doe ſtudie which way wee may doe them any good, either in mainteyning them with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, or defending them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extremities: how much more ought one Frend to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the good eſtate and welfare of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to accoumpt him as his owne, yea as himſelfe: ſpecially hauing vowed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb facs="tcp:14435:17"/>
(and that with an oth) ſo to doe? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will bee readie in trueth to ſay and to promiſe the ſame that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpake and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to <hi>Abiathar:</hi>

And to conclude: All things among friendes (according to the olde Prouerbe) are common.</p>
                  <p>Chiefly, principally and afore all thinges, the one ought to haue an eſpeciall care for the ſaluation and ſoule health of the other: next, for the ſafetie and welfare of the bodie: and thirdly, for their other goodes ioyntly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning vnto them, either in common, in the right of faithfull <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> (of which ſorte be worldly goodes, Cattaile, money, wealth, and the francke vſe thereof at either of their pleaſures) or els priuately and ſingularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto the one of them: as for example, his wife. Therfore, if the one ſhall vnderſtand of any conſpiracie or practiſe deuiſed, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or intended to the hurte and hinderaunce of the other, he will diſcouer and reueale it. For ſo dealt <hi>Ionathan</hi> toward <hi>Dauid.</hi>

                  <p>They will alſo hazard themſelues the one for the other, and put themſelues in preſent

daunger for their defence and reſcue, aſwell in their abſence as in their preſence.<note place="margin">1. Sa. 1.20.30. Ioh. 15.13.</note> For ſo did <hi>Ionathan</hi> put himſelfe into moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perill for his faithfull friend <hi>Dauid.</hi> In al reſpects, and at all aſſaies they are helpfull and aſſiſtaunt, the one to the other.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, by their moſt friendly and ſyncere admonitions, aduiſes, aſſiſtaunce and ayde (ſo farre as by the warrant of the Word of God and of a good Conſcience is lawfull) they vnfaynedly relieue, ſuccour, helpe, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, comfort, encourage, maintaine, nouriſh, cheere vp and ſuſtaine the one the other. For, Friendes doe mutually helpe the one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either with their wealth and goodes: or els with their aduiſe and counſell: or finally with their trauaile, and labour.</p>
                  <p>In their giuing of counſaile, and aduiſe, or in their admonitions and frendly directions, one Friend doth not flatter an other: neither doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale and hide from him, if he eſpye and knowe in him any faultes worthie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. For, <hi>Chriſtian Friendſhip</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto, and reſpecteth the aduauncement of Gods glorie, and not the foſtring and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of men in their errors. He that is a godly friend, remembreth and vſeth this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſentence of <hi>Phocion</hi> the Athenian:
<pb facs="tcp:14435:18"/>
                     <hi>Thou canſt not haue mee to bee both a Flatterer, and a Friend to thee alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a <hi>Flatterer</hi> and a <hi>Friend</hi> doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ in deed and in name: but ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that <hi>Flatterie</hi> is the rankeſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; the moſt daungerous plague to <hi>Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe</hi> that poſſiblie can bee. The which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it carie an outward ſhewe of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſyncere goodwill, yet (doubtleſſe) doth it vtterly vndoe the bond of Friendſhip, vtterly weaken and enfeeble his ſtrength, and vtterly each way deſtroye and marre the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof. For, the Flatterer reſembleth and counterfaiteth the wordes of an vnfained Friend, but not his honeſt mynde, neither his ſyncere loue, nor his true hearted Affection.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, all theſe three poyntes aboue ſpecified, ought among Freendes to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. For, Friendes not onely ſtraine them ſelues mutually to requite curteſies, but alſo in theſe their curteſies, couet the one to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount &amp; paſſe, yea, &amp; to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as much as in them is) the one the other. And therfore theſe perfourmances of mutuall <hi>Loue,</hi> of mutuall <hi>Conſent,</hi> &amp; of mutuall <hi>Defence, Protection</hi> and <hi>Aſsiſtaunce,</hi> bee actions enterchaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and reciprocall. But yet not ſo, as that a Friend ſhould purpoſelie beſtowe a curteſie
<pb facs="tcp:14435:18"/>
vpon his Friend, in hope of as good a turne or as large a benefite at his handes againe: (for no other godly honeſt man extendeth his loue and charitie toward his neighbour, mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe, or as it were, letting and fearming it out for hyre and gaine) but becauſe the force and nature of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is ſuch, that it will not haue theſe things otherwiſe, then mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and reciprocally returnable.</p>
                  <p>All curteſies therefore are betweene them giuen, taken, reſtored, and requited mutually: howbeit (and let this bee well noted) not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies alike, not alwaies equally, nor in ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable proportion. For many tymes the one receiueth at the handes of the other, more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and greater benefite, then he is able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the like meaſure to requite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay: either by reaſon of the great oddes of the eſtate and condition of friendes, or els for the difference of their wealth and abilitie. As for example: the one peraduenture is very rich, the other poore: the one fortunate, the other miſerable: the one exiled and baniſhed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liuing at home in his natiue Countrey. But (all theſe notwithſtanding) he that hath leſſe ſtoare and ſmaller pittaunce of abilitie, although (perchaunce) he requite not ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie and beneficially as hee receiued, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiteth
<pb facs="tcp:14435:19"/>
hee and returneth as much as he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Wherevpon I ſay, that curteſies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites among Friendes, are alwaies mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and enterchangeable, but yet not alwaies alike and equall, as appeareth in <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 20.41.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, Friends doe not onely mutually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, defend and maintaine one an others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, credite, ſtate, wealth and poſſeſſions, but alſo (as much as they are able) procure the ſame to bee bettered and augmented. And therefore there is no maner of rancorous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie or ſpightful diſdaine betweene them. For there is not a greater nor a certainer plague, nor a more fretting Canker vnto ſyncere and true <hi>Frendſhip</hi> (next to Adulation and <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie</hi>) then is Spight and Enuie.</p>

The firſt is, of the Tyme: how long it
<pb facs="tcp:14435:19"/>
ought to remaine and bee continued. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of the maner and way how it ought to be obſerued, retayned and kept: that is to ſay, what, how farre and how much one friend is to perfourme and to doe for an other.</p>
                  <p>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the firſt, which is of the Tyme: let this ſtand for a definitiue and reſolute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that (if the ſyncere vowe and vnfained goodwill of them that godly enter into this Chriſtian league of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> be aduiſedly conſidered) it ought to be endleſſe, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue betweene them perpetually, euen ſo long as they both ſhall liue in this world.</p>
                  <p>And yet many tymes without any fault of theirs, by ſome caſuall error and miſhappe, it may ſo fall out, that there may be good cauſe, either vtterly to renounce and breake of, or at leaſt to withdrawe and relent Friendſhippe. For, what if the one of the Friendes ſhould renye his faith, and of a faithfull beleeuer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a faithleſſe Infidell? and of a Chriſtian become a Turke or a Pagan? Certes, in this caſe all Friendſhip is vtterly to be forſaken, and all Amitie (if after ſundrie exhortations and admonitions hee ſtill perſiſt in his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate miſcreancie) muſt be quight renounced. Howbeit, ſuch a greeuous Apoſtacie and ſuch an horrible backſliding, breedeth in the mynd
<pb facs="tcp:14435:20"/>
of a Friend, no ſmall heauineſſe and ſorowe, yea, and many tymes alſo cauſeth him for a tyme to ſuſpende his determination, and to linger ſome while in hope of amendment and repentance. For, euen ſo likewiſe, at the death of our Friend, (although wee verily beleeue and reſt aſſured that his ſoule is receiued into euerlaſting bliſſe) yet doe wee ſorowe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 1.26.</note> and that ſometyme very much, as wee may ſee in <hi>Dauid.</hi> But yet muſt wee obeye the lawes of God and of our frailtie: Leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, wee ſhould (like the olde Gyaunts) goe about to make warre againſt God, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiouſly to preferre our owne affections before the feare of the Lord our maker.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, there may oftentymes be giuen moſt iuſt occaſion to breake and renounce <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> but yet the vowe and purpoſe at the firſt, ought ſo ſyncerely to be made and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as that it ſhould laſt, continue, and be retayned for euer. And therefore that tearme and ſentence which by ſome is vſed, is moſt beaſtly and reprooueable: <hi>Loue, as though thou ſhouldeſt one day hate.</hi> Which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and aduiſe, if it ſhould preuaile and bee allowed, then farewell all faſt <hi>Friendſhip</hi>: for then is all the force, pith and ſtrength thereof vaniſhed: then bee all the ſynewes of it looſed
<pb facs="tcp:14435:20"/>
and weakened: and all that firme truſt and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ought to be among Frendes, (ſafely, boldly and willingly to impart and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate together their myndes one with an other, and one to reueale and open his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes vnto an other) is vtterly daſhed and put to flight. For why? neither will they, neither dare they aduenture ſo to doe, for feare of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terclappes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, to the ende they may thankfully, pleaſantly, truſtily and boldly liue together, this ſilthie Deuiliſh tearme of diffidence and diſtruſt <hi>(Loue, as though thou ſhouldeſt one day hate)</hi> muſt bee quight baniſhed and vtterly remoued out of their mynds: although (as I ſaid afore) it may ſometyme ſo fall out, that we may and ought to hate thoſe whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretyme wee haue right dearely loued: but this thing happeneth contrary to the hope, deſire and wiſh of Friendes. Therefore let this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of truſt and good opinion rather take place &amp; be heard, <hi>Loue, as though thou ſhouldeſt neuer hate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So long therefore, as thoſe two Friendes doe liue together, they ought in heart &amp; vowe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue, keepe and maintaine their Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe with all maner of behoouefull curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: and not to conceiue ſo much, as any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,
<pb facs="tcp:14435:21"/>
either of breaking, or vtter diſſoluing thereof. For this courſe doe they ſtill take, that are true and faithfull Friendes within themſelues.</p>
                  <p>But there is an other queſtion here moued: When the one of the Friendes is dead, what ought the other Frend being aliue, to do with the deceaſed parties Children? and how is he in reſpect of the Friendſhippe which hee bare to their father, to deale with them? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſame <hi>Friendſhippe</hi> ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued towarde the Children of him beeing dead or no?</p>
                  <p>Truely, it very well ſtandeth with the rule of Equitie and Reaſon, that as Children bee heyres of their fathers Landes and Goodes, ſo alſo to enherite their fathers <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> accordingly as <hi>Iſocrates</hi> writing to <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> hath moſt excellently ſet downe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe among the fathers Goodes, his <hi>Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> is alſo reckened, and is many times farre better and profitabler, then al the enheritance that the Father leaueth or can bequeath vnto his Children.

and Children.</p>
                  <p>Thus did the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> betweene <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> reach and extend vnto the Children of <hi>Ionathan.</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are both the Wife and Children of the deceaſſed Friend to be tenderly loued, and all other thinges beſides, that appertained vnto him: yea, the very Dogges and the Cattaile that belonged vnto him: and all this, through an inward affection of hearty goodwil borne vnto the late owner, and by the law and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perfect <hi>Friendſhippe</hi>: Howbeit not in ſuch meaſure and proportion as the partie Friend himſelfe being deceaſſed: but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great loue &amp; vehement zeale of their late firme Amitie and ſtedfaſt coniunction li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſtill in the breaſt of him that remayneth aliue, and ſendeth foorth many ſparkes of his

                  <p>Hereupon there groweth yet an other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, about that gift of Goodes, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> beſtowed on <hi>Ziba</hi> the ſeruant of <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth:</hi> which (gift notwithſtanding that he was afterward better enfourmed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth of the matter, and of <hi>Ziba</hi> his treacherous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie towarde his Maiſter): yet did he not wholly and entierly reuoke. For, the Goodes which in right belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged vnto <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> (who was the Sonne of <hi>Ionathan,</hi>) he gaue vnto <hi>Ziba:</hi> whereas he had afore, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of his Friend <hi>Ionathan</hi> appoynted the ſame vnto this his Sonne, and had giuen commaundement that the ſame ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and aſſured vnto him: thereby to ſhewe himſelfe thankfull and myndfull of the firme Friendſhippe betweene himſelfe, and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 9. verſ. 7.</note> father of the ſayd <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> Yet <hi>Dauid</hi> being afterwards ſuttly beguiled and craftily deceiued by <hi>Ziba,</hi> reuoked his former gift made to <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> and tooke away from him,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. verſ. 4.</note> all that he had afore beſtowed vpon him.</p>
                  <p>Now, the queſtion is this, whether this laſt
<pb facs="tcp:14435:22"/>
fact of <hi>Dauid</hi> may bee defended: or how can hee any wayes bee excuſed, but that he dealt herein, directly and flatly againſt the lawes and endes of true <hi>Friendſhip?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt and formoſt, when as the ſame <hi>Dauid</hi>
might eaſilie haue eſpyed the falſhood of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> and how cunningly he had bene deceiued and circumuented by his treacherie and falſe tales: yet ſhewed hee not ſo much fauour and compaſſion vnto his deare Friendes Sonne, as either ſeuerely to puniſh and ſharpelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge ſo notable a villanie and fraudulent coſenage, wrought againſt him by his owne ſeruaunt:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 19. verſ. 29.</note> nor yet to reſtore vnto him all his Goodes againe.</p>
                  <p>Certes, in this caſe, (as I thinke) <hi>Dauid</hi> cannot at any hand bee excuſed, but that hee greatly offended and ſinned, and that moe waies then one: to wit, firſt in reſpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King: and ſecondly as being the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſworne Friende of <hi>Ionathan</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that, he was a King, his office and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had beene to haue puniſhed and reuenged the open treacherie and manifeſt falſhood of the Seruaunt againſt his Lord and Maiſter. And in that he was a Friend: his duetie had bene to haue relieued &amp; protected the Sonne
<pb facs="tcp:14435:23"/>
of his deceaſſed Friend, being ſhamefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed and lewdly deceiued through the fraude of his owne Seruaunt, and pitifully deſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all his Goodes by him that was his Vaſſall. His office and duetie (I ſaye) had bene, in remembraunce of the great Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe betweene him and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> to haue defended and ſupported his Sonne being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and afflicted: and being well able, to haue reſtored him to his fathers inheritance.</p>
                  <p>But in that, <hi>Dauid</hi> neglected and omitted ſo to doe, ſurely therein he is worthy of great reprehenſion, and to be deemed and accoump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as one vtterly vnmyndfull of his office and duetie. Furthermore to haue tranſgreſſed the Boundes, and to haue ſinned againſt the lawes of true <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> yea and quight to haue forgotten both his promiſe and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which he had afore receiued. Therefore this fact of <hi>Dauid</hi> is not by any that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Friendes to be imitated and followed, neither to be drawne into example.</p>
                  <p>If any man to excuſe <hi>Dauid,</hi> will ſay: that becauſe he had bound himſelf by an Oath, and had now alreadie giuen the ſame Goodes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ziba,</hi> that therefore he could not lawfully call backe his promiſe: the anſwere hereunto is eaſilie ſhaped. For <hi>Dauid</hi> had afore giuen
<pb facs="tcp:14435:23"/>
the very ſame Goodes vnto <hi>Mephiboſheth:</hi> and therefore in that partition of them which hee graunted to bee equally made betweene them both, hee cleared not himſelfe from the Conſcience of his Oath before God. For, he ſware alſo vnto <hi>Ziba,</hi> that he would giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him all the whole Goodes of <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,</hi> and not a moytie or portion of them onely. And yet he aſſigned vnto him but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part, and tooke an other part away from him. And therefore, euen in this ſame parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Dauid</hi> brake his Oath, and therein is he manifeſtly culpable afore God, for taking his Diuine name in vaine.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, there can no excuſe bee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor any reaſon (as I thinke) alledged, whereby <hi>Dauid</hi> in this caſe can bee cleared either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foule fault of breach of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> or of his ſolemne Oath lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g afore ſworne vnto <hi>Ionathan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing, that in the diſcuſſing of the Endes of <hi>Friendſhippe,</hi> is brought into queſtion, is of the Maner and Way, how and in what ſorte, and how farre, by the lawes of <hi>Friendſhippe,</hi> Friendes muſt doe one for an other. Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marily, ſuch Maner, ſuch Bounds, ſuch Endes, ſuch Limites and Markes muſt to the ſame bee appoynted, and ſo farre muſt
<pb facs="tcp:14435:24"/>
mutuall curteſies among Friendes be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeably perfourmed, as that at no hand the Maieſtie, Will, and glorie of God be any way hindered or in anywiſe diſhonoured. For further then ſo, neither ought they to goe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it in anywiſe lawfull for a Chriſtian man further to preſume.</p>
                  <p>For, although among vs men, that Friend is highly and dearely to be loued, vnto whom by Vowe and Oath wee haue moſt ſtrictly bound our ſelues: yet is God more to bee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, vnto whom we owe both our ſelues, and our Friends, and all things els that we haue: and in whoſe name and authoritie al the force, ſubſtaunce and effect of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and eſtabliſhed.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note> So did <hi>Paule</hi> loue <hi>Peter,</hi> but yet he loued the glorie of God more. So did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> loue <hi>Plato,</hi> but yet (as he him ſelfe ſaieth) he loued the trueth more. And the very Heathen and Paynim people, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded concerning the boundes of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and how farre one Friend were to deale and to doe for an other, could eloquently and pithily anſwer, euen as did <hi>Pericles,</hi> that they would both ſpeak, doe, &amp; goe for their Frend, but yet no further then to the Aultar, that is, no further then Religion and Conſcience ſhould warrant them. Their opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:14435:24"/>
&amp; their doctrine was this, that a man law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully may doe for his Friend all the pleaſure he poſſiblie can, ſauing and forpriſing his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and obedience to the word of God: but no further. And herein truely ſaied they well. As alſo <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> hath likewiſe noted.</p>
                  <p>For,<note place="margin">Noct Attic. lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> although we bee to hazard the loſſe of our owne ſtate and wealth, yea and of our life alſo, for our Friendes ſake (neither ought this loſſe and daunger to be refuſed,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.13.</note> if we will bee true Friends in deede) yet the glorie of God, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternall ſaluation of our Soule, ought more to bee eſteemed and regarded then any cauſe of our Friend whatſoeuer it bee. And we neither may, neither ought to bee thought herein to faile, or to come ſhorte in the office and duetie of a faithfull Friend, if we denye, at our Friends requeſt (be it neuer ſo earneſt) to doe any thing that is vnlawfull and vniuſt, or againſt the law of God and Godlines: yea wee muſt rather doe the parte of a godly and Chriſtian Friend, in ſhewing our ſelues rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die rather to obey God then Man: and alſo to haue more care of our Friends ſaluation and Soule health, then of any worldly wealth or tranſitorie commoditie.</p>
                  <p>And let him (whoſoeuer he bee that reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vs to doe for him any vnlawfull act)
<pb facs="tcp:14435:25"/>
blame and accuſe himſelfe for aſking: rather then vs for denying and for not obeying and feeding his humour. For, he it is which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth and breaketh the true bounds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and faithfull <hi>Friendſhid,</hi> and not we.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſt not ſticke many times to ſuffer our name &amp; fame to bee vniuſtly reported and ſpoken of, among the vulgar ſorte of People: but neuer muſt wee either for Friend or any man els, commit that which is filthie, vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, fraudulent, vnhoneſt or wicked. Whereby it euidently appeareth, that that ſentence of <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi> in his Booke of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and other Philoſophers alſo, is erroneous, falſe, and vtterly to bee reiected: for they ſay: <hi>If the caſe ſo ſtande, or if the matter ſo fall out, that our Friends willes in vniuſt cauſes muſt bee furthered &amp; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whereon either dependeth their life and death, or their fame and credite: Wee may in ſuch a caſe for their ſakes digreſſe, ſwerue and wander ſomewhat out of the path of honeſtie, ſo that it be not in a mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter extreemely villanous, or wherein vtter ſhame and reproach may grow. For there bee certaine boundes: how farre to wade in our Friends behalfe, and wherin a man in reſpect of Friendſhip is pardonable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14435:25"/>Wee both may, and alſo ought (I ſay) to gratifie and pleaſure our Friend: but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſinne, or offending the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, to caſt away both our Friend and our ſelues, we may not, nor ought not in any wiſe. Therefore maye wee not for our Friends cauſe, or at his requeſt, either waſte, ſpoyle, conſume and ſet on fier Churches, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces and houſes, neither ought we to warre and beare Armes againſt our Countrey, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violently to aſſault or contemptuouſly abuſe the Magiſtrate, neither any way iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to hurt any priuate perſon.

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is it lawfull to lye for our friends ſake, therby to helpe his cauſe, or to bring him out of any extremitie: albeit at ſome tyme, and in ſome caſes, it is not forbidden vs in our Friendes cauſe to diſſemble a matter, or to make ſemblaunce &amp; countenaunce as though ſome things were true, which in deed are not ſo: ſuch things I meane, as whereby neither God is diſhonored, nor our Neighbour dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſted.

                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 20.29.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that, wee neither allowe the example and fact of <hi>Huſhai</hi> the <hi>Archite,</hi> neither in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

wiſe thinke it meete and lawfull to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: who for that duetifull ſeruice that hee would ſeeme to doe vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and for that entier and loyall <hi>Friendſhip</hi> that he bore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, circumuented and entrapped an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. verſ. 16.17 18.19.</note> (to wit, <hi>Abſolon</hi>) by craft and ſubtiltie. For, he lyed, and diſſembled with <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and therein hee greatly ſinned, although hee was not onely aduiſed and admoniſhed, but alſo requeſted and earneſtly entreated by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſo to deale and ſo to doe.<note place="margin">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>But in all theſe things we muſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marke, and carefully reſpect not onely what our <hi>Friend</hi> requeſteth at our handes to be done for him: but much rather to conſider what beſeemeth vs or any Chriſtian man in duetie and Conſcience to perfourme.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and of the Endes, Bounds and Circumſtaunces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, briefly and ſummarily haue wee hitherto diſcourſed, vpon aduiſed conſideration and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent meditation of that faithfull <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe</hi> that was betweene <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. </hi>

our whole life, but alſo of euery ſingular actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, and how we haue beſtowed euery ſmal moment of tyme in this preſent world. And what good accoumpts (ſay they) can he yeeld of his Idleneſſe, that hath ſpent his tyme in playing?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, ſeeing we are commaunded to refraine from euery ydle worde,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.36</note> as Chriſt himſelfe teacheth vs: for that all our triefling toyes and fond vanities doe greatly diſpleaſe and offend God, although in them we neither ſweare, neither blaſpheme his holy name: How ſhall we bee accoumpted guiltleſſe and blameleſſe before the ſame our heauenly Father, if wee ydlie, vainely, vnthriftily and vnfruitfully miſſpende our tyme (which is a thing moſt precious) in play and diſporting? For, whatſoeuer we doe, we muſt ſo doe it, as that it may tend to the glorie of God and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of his honor, as that bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle S.<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>Now, if wee ſpende our tyme in vanities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſume our life in <hi>Play,</hi> may it bee well ſayde (I praye you) that wee therein reſpect Gods glorie, or haue regard to his honor?</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.16.</note>The ſame Apoſtle alſo diligently and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in an other place admoniſheth vs, <hi>to redeeme the tyme.</hi> For wee haue beſtowed

                  <p>Beeing now therefore through the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefite and goodnes of God become Chriſtians, and enlightened with the bright beames of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, ſhall we, or is it meete we ſhould beſtowe the reſidue of our tyme in playing, trifeling, toying, and idle loytering?<note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>It is ſufficient for vs</hi> (ſaieth the Apoſtle Peter) <hi>that wee haue ſpent the tyme paſt of the life after the luſte of the Gentiles, walking in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, luſtes, drunkenneſſe, gluttonie, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges and abhominable Idolatries: that hencefoorth we ſhould not liue (as much tyme as remayneth) in the fleſh, nor after the luſtes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but after the will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truely there be ſo many vertuous due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtian life, which God requireth at our handes: and ſo many occaſions euery ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer miniſtred vnto vs, whereby we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and aduaunce the glory of God, and alſo procure the benefite and commoditie of our Neighbour: that euery hower and minute of an hower ſtill bringeth with it ſome one new occaſion or other, to ſuch end and purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14435:31"/>Therfore, to omit thoſe ſo many and ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie exerciſes both of minde and bodie: and in ſteede thereof, ydlie, vainely, ſecurely and Dronelike, to embuſie our ſelues with ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, paſtime, playe and daliaunce, is a thing, that many thinke not to bee allowed of, in vs that bee Chriſtians. And if wee will knowe what thoſe many good exerciſes bee, we will here note ſome certaine of them for example ſake: to wit, diligent reading and hearing of the holie and bleſſed Worde of God: confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and peruſing of the auncient Fathers and Catholique writers: knowledge of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, which are moſt profitable for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly direction of our life: viſiting of the Sicke: comforting of them that are in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and finally the diligent exerciſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of that Arte, Trade and Function which euery man particularlie profeſſeth.<note place="margin">Math. 25.35.36.</note> All which the Lord in his Worde commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
                  <p>Now, that we ſhould either altogether, or for the moſt part omit theſe things, and be (in lieu thereof) addicted to beſtowe our ſelues and our tyme in vanities: this is a thing (I ſay) that ſome men and the ſame both vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and godlie, cannot well allowe of: but do thinke it to carie matter of great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
<pb facs="tcp:14435:31"/>
that any Chriſtian ſhould ſo vainely beſtowe any part of his life in <hi>Playe</hi> and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better confirmation of this their opinion, they bring the ſentence &amp; iudgement of that reuerend Father <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his firſt Booke of Offices. Chap. <hi>23.</hi> and alſo in his expoſition of the <hi>118.</hi> Pſalme: where that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man and graue Father ſeemeth flatly and abſolutely to condemne all kindes of Playe, generally. And ſo alſo an other auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>S. Chriſoſtome,</hi> in his <hi>6.</hi> Homilie vpon Mathewes Goſpell, diſalloweth in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie all maner of ſportes and playes. And theſe be the reaſons which thei briefly alledge and bring for confirmation of their aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, we doe not altogether ſo thinke, but are rather of an other opinion, and ſay, that ſome conuenient recreation may very reaſonably be allowed, and pardoned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to humaine imbecillitie: and herein haue wee on our ſide, ioyning in iudgement with vs, the authoritie of other auncient Fathers, no leſſe reuerend and accoumpted of, then they: namely <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his ſeconde Booke <hi>de Muſica:</hi> whoſe minde and opinion we rather following, doe denye, that it is vtterly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a Chriſtian man, to play at all, or not to
<pb facs="tcp:14435:32"/>
vſe any recreation. Yea, we ſay, that it is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe mans parte to recreate and refreſh his minde and bodie, being ouerwearied with ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, accumbred with cares, and cloyed with labours, by laying aſide (for a while) his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſerious buſineſſe, and to betake him ſelfe to ſome comely and decent recreation: whereby he may (as it were) breathe a while from his burthen, to the intent afterwarde with the freſher courage and liuelier minde to renewe his former toyle, and giue the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtier onſet vpon his intermitted buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Their reaſons therefore afore, may eaſilie and with one word be anſwered: to witte, by diſtinguiſhing betweene ſuch thinges as bee allowed vnto a Chriſtian man, and be merely indifferent. For, ſome things be of ſuch kind and nature, that to bee ſtill occupied therein, is not at any hand allowable: of which ſorte is <hi>Playe:</hi> which for ſome ſhort time onely and ſome very ſmall while, may be well allowed and borne withall in a Chriſtian man. But to ſpend much tyme therein, or to make a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practiſe thereof, is (vndoubtedly) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, vntollerable, and vttetly diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as that worthie Warriour ſaid of Philoſophie, that he delighted to reaſon of
<pb facs="tcp:14435:32"/>
Philoſophie, but yet in fewe words &amp; briefly: ſo the ſame and in better right may wee ſaye of Playe, <hi>viz.</hi> that to Playe now and then is lawfull, but yet for a ſmall while, not for any long ſpace.</p>
                  <p>For, vtterly to abandon, baniſh, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Playe from this life of ours, is a thing more rigorous, ſeuere and cruell, then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man can eaſilie beare. Neither may a Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cloyed with long trauailes and much labours bee any whit leſſe denyed and debarred Play, for the refreſhing of his mind and reuiuing his wittes, then being wearie, to bee allowed to ſleepe: beeing thirſtie, to drinke: being hungrie to eate, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the Scriptures of God (which be left and deliuered vnto vs as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt rule to knowe what things wee are bounden to doe, &amp; what to eſchewe and forbeare) make mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as of a thing lawfull and allowable, and ſetteth it downe as a great benefite and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God. <hi>Zech. 8.5.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 8.5.</note> And in that ſentence which is aduouched and brought out of the Epiſtle of Paule to the Corinthians:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye doo, doe all to the glorie of God,</hi> it cannot be denyed but that Playes and Sportes are incluſiuely comprehended in theſe wordes, <hi>or
<pb facs="tcp:14435:33"/>
whatſoeuer other things ye doe:</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that intermiſſion of labour and honeſt recreation of mynde is no leſſe profitable, and oftentymes alſo no leſſe neceſſarie, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie and comforte of the weake Powers and exhauſted ſtrength of our ſeelie bodies, then is Reſt, Sleepe and Meate, wherewith wee are nouriſhed. And our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt moſt excellently teaching vs that man was made for the glorie of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.27.</note> ſaieth, that <hi>the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The which ſelfe ſame thing is alſo to bee thought of Play and diſport. For it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed for man, to refreſh his decayed ſtrength and to reuiue his wearied ſprightes, and alſo by this kind of reſt and recreation to preſerue his bodie in health and ſoundnes, the better, therelier and freelier afterward to ſerue God and applye his vacation.</p>
                  <p>Certes, in the number of ſuch thinges as are tearmed <hi>Indifferent,</hi> and are allowed by God vnto a Chriſtian man, ought Play to be reckened: and yet may not the ſame bee abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as alſo no other of thoſe things ought to bee, that are called Meane, Indifferent, and Adiaphorall.</p>
                  <p>For doubtleſſe, thoſe men are too ſtraite
<pb facs="tcp:14435:33"/>
laced, and are too preciſely wedded vnto an ouerharde cenſure and opinion, which flatly and abſolutely denye and debarre a Godlie faithfull man (beeing oppreſſed and almoſt foreſpent with infinite cares of the mynd, and otherwiſe wearied with bodily labour) al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of recreation and diſport, which might be (as it were) a profitable &amp; wholeſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for his diſeaſe and inconuenience.</p>
                  <p>Neither may that man bee ſayd not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and reſpect Gods glorie, who refreſheth and recreateth himſelfe with an intent, and to the ende hee may afterwarde with perfecter ſtrength, luſtier cheere, and greater courage both of bodie and mynd, returne to his former charge, and afreſh betake himſelfe vnto that calling, wherunto he is by God aſſigned: and may alſo the readier ſerue his Countrie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite the Common wealth, and prouide for his houſhold and familie, for that his health is ſtrong, perfect and ſound.</p>
                  <p>For, the wit and nature of man may very well and aptly be likened vnto a Bow, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t verſe &amp; ſaying of the Poet.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>The bodie and wit of man may well bee</l>
                     <l>Reſembled and fitly comparde to a Bow:</l>
                     <l>Which ſtill ſtanding bent, and at no tyme free,</l>
                     <l>Muſt needes (and that ſhortly) grow weake, ſoft and ſlow.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14435:34"/>Therefore, as a Bowe if it be not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme vnbent, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſoft, ſluggiſh, weake and vnprofitable: ſo fareth it with the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fineneſſe of the wit: if ſometyme it haue not his conuenient reſt and relaxation, it ſoone ſhrinketh vnder his burthen, and in ſhort while becommeth both dull, blunt and loggiſh. We doe not therfore generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all Playe, neither doe wee denye the ſame to a Chriſtian man, but that he may in ſome honeſt ſort recreate and refreſh himſelf. For, honeſt Sportes and comely Playes we doe well allowe euen vnto Godly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men: howbeit wee will and wiſh that a meaſure and moderation bee therein alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly kept and Chriſtianliie obſerued.</p>

may not playe for money, with an intent to make it his owne, to keepe it to his priuate vſe: or (as we ſay) to put it vp in his own purſe for his owne priuate gaine and commoditie.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons moouing vs hereunto be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the ſame alſo very manifeſt: of the which, ſome we will at this tyme and in this place alledge and declare.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Play</hi> was not at the beginning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed among men for any Commerce, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, buying or ſelling, chopping or changing, traffique or entercourſe, whereby to procure and catch vnto our ſelues any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to any other: but onely to bee a kinde of meanes &amp; way for recreation of the mynd, and a refreſhing or exerciſing of the bodie: in ſo much that whoſoeuer vſeth Play to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende or purpoſe, doth not rightly vſe, but filthilie and diſorderly abuſe it, exchaunging that which ſerueth for an honeſt recreation of Man, into a moſt vile and filthy kind of gaine and couetouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.3. Collo. 3.5.</note> which (as the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) we ought chiefly to eſchue.</p>
                  <p>Neither by any lawe either diuine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, hath Playe euer beene reckened and accoumpted among thoſe ſortes and kindes of Contracts, whereby we lawfully may bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or alienate our goodes. If there bee any
<pb facs="tcp:14435:35"/>
humaine Lawes, which recken vp all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt kindes of contracts, and maners of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayninges, they bee thoſe, that are at this day called the Ciuill Lawes of the Romaines. But they onely recken vp Buying, ſelling, letting out, hiering and ferming, making and taking of Leaſes with Couenaunts, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other contracts beſide: by the which wee maye by Lawe both conueigh that which is ours to others, and alſo aſſure that which is other mens, to vs.</p>
                  <p>As for Play, it is not once named among them. For why? Play is none of thoſe kindes of things and actions, if we throughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and truely looke into either the nature or the ende of Play. Whoſoeuer therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth and keepeth to his owne vſe an other mans money or goodes, onely becauſe he hath by Playe gayned and wonne the ſame: that man truely doth uniuſtly and wrongfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it: &amp; with no better right or conſcience, then a Theefe keepeth &amp; poſſeſſeth the thing that he falſlely hath ſtolne.</p>
                  <p>For, if it might be lawfull for vs (after this ſorte, that is to ſay, by Play) to catch and get other mens goodes or money: what other thing (I pray you) ſhould wee bring in, then in ſteede of Play, to ſet vp a kinde of vnſacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:14435:35"/>
and greedie couetouſneſſe: and therby vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly peruert the very right nature of things, while of a matter of ſporte and paſtime wee make, not onely a matter of ſerious earneſt, but alſo of raking gayne and filthie lucre?</p>
                  <p>By Play therefore to gayne other folkes money, is all one with ſtealing. And lawfull is it not any way: no, although the maners, or priuate cuſtome of any particular Citie or Countrey did permit and allowe it. For that permiſſion and allowance (if any ſuch ſhould be) is encountred, met with all, oppugned and repealed by the Lawe of Nature her ſelfe: which being of farre greater force and equitie then any priuate or municipall Lawe, ought much more to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Albeit, I doe not remember that I haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer read, that it hath bene enacted, conſtituted and allowed by the Law written of any Citie or Countrey, that ſuch kind of money as was gotten by Play, might either be kept and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: or (if it were not payed) might by law from the debter bee recouered. For, there lay no action for any ſuch debt, neither was there euer any iudiciall Plea by the lawes allowed to bee commenced and recorded, whereupon the Iudge proceeded to any ſentence: vnleſſe (perhappes) it were the Teniſe play, (which
<pb facs="tcp:14435:36"/>
hath found ſo much fauour, to be ſpecially pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged in ſome Cities &amp; places, by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate lawes of their Countrey) that if a man doe winne thereat ſome little portion or ſmal pittaunce of money, (as namely a groate or ſixe pence, or thereaboutes) he may indicially demaund and recouer the ſame. Which Play ſeemeth hereupon to haue found this ſpeciall fauour, for that there is in it (as <hi>Galene</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) an excellent good and wholeſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Bodie, and no leſſe induſtrie of the mynde.</p>
                  <p>But as for other ſortes of Play &amp; Games, or of any gaine or money thereupon promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there lyeth neither Action nor Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Yea which is more: if the money ſtaked and layed downe bee kept backe, detayned or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the winner after the victorie or game ended, the looſer ſhall haue his remedie by lawe, and may lawfully ſue the winner as an vniuſt withholder and wrongfull detayner of that which is none of his.

<pb facs="tcp:14435:39"/>
to binde, clogge and enſnare the conſcience: we wil here in this caſe ſet downe two excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt whereof is this: That thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Exerciſes &amp; Games which are appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by authoritie of the Magiſtrate (although they bee tearmed and knowne by the name of Playes) yet are not comprehended within the compaſſe of that generall Rule, before by vs ſet downe &amp; deliuered: neither that the gaines and rewardes publiquely appoynted and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by authoritie of the Magiſtrate for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the Common wealth, to bee thereby condemned. For, ſuch Games and Exerciſes are lawfull for vs, not onely to followe and frequent, and for the ſame to ſtriue and doe our vttermoſt deuoyre: but alſo, if wee can in the ſame winne the victorie, we may honeſtlie carie the prize away, and detaine and reſerue it to our ſelues, and lawfully keepe it as our owne well and truely gotten goodes.</p>
                  <p>Neither needeth any doubt thereof to bee made, but that it is both lawful, and may alſo be done with a good and ſafe conſcience. For, ſuch maner of Prizes and rewardes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and appoynted by the Magiſtrate, and not by priuate perſons. And if they were (as many times they bee) aſſigned and ſet out by
<pb facs="tcp:14435:39"/>
priuate perſons, yet are they warranted by publique authoritie. Againe, theſe Exerciſes of minde and bodie are profitablie meant and appoynted, for the whetting, ſharpening and encreaſing of mens induſtrie: whereby both the priuate perſon is ſolaced and recreated, and alſo a publique benefite to the Countrey and Common wealth procured and prouided.</p>
                  <p>For, theſe publique Exerciſes and euen Shewes, Games, Sportes and Prizes, bee (as it were) certaine preludes, preparatiues, aſſaies and traynings of Warfare: and may ſtande in great ſteede for ſundrie occaſions: that when the Commonwealth ſhall haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny neede of our helpe, wee may be the readier to ſerue, and the riper in our charges: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the trayning vp of the people therein, (to helpe when neede is, their Countrey) is a thing not onely tolerable, but alſo very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and commendable.</p>
                  <p>To this ende, and for this purpoſe is it at this day in moſt Countries vſed, to traine and exerciſe their ſeruiceable perſons in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling their Pieces, their Caliuer, their Muſkee or the Harquebuſe, to prime, charge or ſhoote in great Ordnaunce, to traile and toſſe the Pike, to ſhoote in the long Bowe or Croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe: becauſe theſe bee the things that haue
<pb facs="tcp:14435:40"/>
many times ſtoode the Countrey in notable ſteede, when it hath by forraine inuaſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward garboyles bene endaungered.</p>
                  <p>And to the end, the people ſhould the more willingly frame themſelues to the ſame exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, there are Prizes &amp; rewards by publike authoritie propoſed and ſet out: yet not of any great ſumme, but rather of ſome ſmall valew, and to bee as it were, a certaine cheering or honeſt allurement vnto them for their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie: or as a token of an open praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation giuen vnto them for their well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which is a thing greatly profitable for the Common wealth. For, honor, preferment, reward and dignitie nouriſheth Arts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth knowledge: &amp; Glorie is the Spurre that pricketh all men forward to wel doings. And therefore in all Ages ſuch kinde of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Exerciſes and Wagers haue bene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, allowed and practiſed.</p>
                  <p>And albeit thoſe which were in the old time exerciſed, were farre differing from ſuch as we now adaies haue in vſe: yet were they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned, and had a reſpect vnto the maner of Warfare and Martiall ſeruice then among them vſed. For although they then had deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Engines to throwe Darts and Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins to annoye their Enemies a farre of, yet
<pb facs="tcp:14435:40"/>
had they no Gunnes, but fought it out, man to man, with downe right blowes, ioyning foote to foote and hand to hand: And among them alſo, they had ſundrie ſortes of publique Exerciſes and Games for wagers, but yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially theſe fiue: Wreſtling, hurling a Coyte who could hurle it fartheſt or higheſt, of length or height: Running or leaping: Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Vnto theſe, did the Romaines afterwards adde an other, which was, fighting with Ships on the water: exhibited and ſolemnely kept, ſpecially in the Raigne of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> to conſerue in freſh memorie his noble victorie at <hi>Actium:</hi> and the ſhew thereof was on the Riuer of <hi>Tyber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterward there was alſo added an other kinde of warlike exerciſe on Horſback, which in the old time was tearmed <hi>Troye,</hi> and was accuſtomed to be openly ſhewed in the vſuall Fielde of Exerciſe called <hi>Campus Martius:</hi>

daunger thereof, and alſo was found to be an occaſion to drawe aſpiring mindes vnto am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicious deſiers, it was afterwards by publick authoritie of the Lawes worthilie put downe and diſcontinued.</p>
                  <p>But to returne again to our purpoſe: thoſe Rewards, Wagers, Prizes and offers which were publickly ſet out &amp; propoſed for ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſhould put forwarde themſelues in theſe kinds of exerciſes to play &amp; ſtriue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly and for the moſt part of ſmall value: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might ſeeme to bee rather as a token of victorie and a praiſe to the partie that wanne the ſame,<note place="margin">Lib. 5.

Whereunto when any queſtion is mooued vnto mee for my opinion therein to bee had, my cuſtome and order is this to anſwere. If wee firſt ſet downe and ſhewe what kindes thereof bee forbidden, it ſhall be an eaſie matter to pronounce of al the reſt: to wit, that all others hee lawfull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly permitted to a Chriſtian.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14435:43"/>
long time as we ſhall dwel or ſeiourne in that Countrey and place, wee muſt and ought of refraine them. For, ſuch is the condition to Chriſtian libertie, concerning things of them ſelues meerely indifferent, that according to the diuers circumſtances of matters, places, times and perſons, it may be reſtrayned.</p>
                  <p>Neither ought wee to violate and breake ſuch lawes, as particular Countreyes, Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gniories and Cities haue eſtabliſhed, enacted and made concerning the ſame: ſpecially if therein we may keepe a good and cleare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, without ſtooping or yeelding to any Superſtition.

                  <p>Secondly, I call all thoſe Games and Playes vnhoneſt, vnſeemely and vnlawfull, wherein there is any euill, vnhoneſt, filthie, vnchaſt or vnſeemely actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, practiſe or pranke,

Theſe kindes of Playe may not properly be tearmed <hi>Alea</hi> or <hi>Hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie,</hi> neither are they abſolutely to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: onely let meaſurable meane therein bee vſed.</p>
                  <p>Others there be that hang and depend (as it were) vpon mere chaunce &amp; caſting: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a mans induſtrie (if there bee no packing, falſehoode and cogging deceipt vſed) can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auaile. This kinde of Play is properly called <hi>Alea:</hi> and this is it, that wee ſay is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſallowable, and to be baniſhed and caſt out of the Banquettes, Feaſtes, Meetinges, Aſſemblies, Families and handes of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: for that, whatſoeuer lucke giueth and blind chaunce herein allotteth, the Players and Gameſters take vp and deteyne: and the loſſe or chaunce hereby ſuſtained cannot by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Art that is lawfull and honeſt, bee recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or amended.</p>

                  <p>And therefore all ſuch kindes of Playes and Games, we muſt confeſſe to be properly and truely tearmed <hi>Alea:</hi> for that, al the hope of victorie and winning thereby, conſiſteth in the doubtfull hazard, euent, and caſting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be at Cardes or Dyce: and not in any laudable, commendable or lawfull induſtrie of man.

tell how they ſhall ſpeede, nor what good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe they ſhall haue, till they ſee it plainely ſo come to paſſe, there muſt lucke, chaunce and hazard needes altogether take place &amp; beare ſway: and therefore is this maner of Play cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alea.</hi> And this is that naughtie and vile Play, which wee in this place and in all this our preſent Treatiſe haue pronounced and proteſted to bee vnlawfull and diſallowable: and doe heartilie wiſh it to be farre of from al Chriſtian mens practiſe: &amp; if it haue through too much licentious ouerſight beene at any time heretofore frequented and vſed, that it be now from hencefoorth renounced, forſaken, loathed and deteſted.</p>

And thereupon they gather, that in Lotte caſting (in which kinde (doubtleſſe) Dyceplaye is contained,) wee ought not in any wiſe for maintenaunce of our peeuiſh pleaſures, to vſe vaine and ydle matters, in ſteede of graue and godlie exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: for that therein we doe after a ſorte make a mock of Gods prouidence,<note place="margin">Pro. 16.33.</note> and raſhly abuſe the greateſt teſtimonies and effects thereof, ſuch as Lotterie is. By this meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they holde opinion that the power and Maieſtie of God, is prophaned and taken in vaine.</p>
                  <p>For, thus are we taught both by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of holy men, and by the very Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God himſelfe, that we ſhould not vſe theſe Lottes (wherein there reſteth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular argument and token of Gods diuine prouidence, as before was ſayde) in vaine, trifeling or phantaſticall matter: but rather then and at ſuch tyme onely, when as there falleth out ſome matter of great moment and waightie importaunce: wherein God himſelf (as an extraordinarie moderatour, Ruler and Vmpier) muſt interpoſe his doome, ſtrike the ſtroake and decide the caſe: leaſt otherwiſe, if wee raſhlie and lightlie caſt out Lottes, wee ſeeme not onely to goe about to tempt God,
<pb facs="tcp:14435:51"/>
but alſo wickedly to offer ſome notable iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and villanous diſhonour vnto his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie power and prouidence.</p>
                  <p>In deede, for the electing of Magiſtrates, diuiding of Goodes, partition of Landes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Coheires, or in making a choyſe of Paſtors in the Church, there maye bee cauſe ſometyme to vſe Lottes: becauſe in theſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes the voyce and conſent of GOD is more neceſſarie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men: and alſo, for that, there appeareth many tymes therein an, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie meanes of Gods will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: &amp; is a good way alſo to ende al quarrels and to auoyde all corruption of voyces. But in ſporting toyes and friuolous cauſes (as though we would make God, ſeruaunt to our vanities and paſtimes) to vſe Lots, they hold it vtterly vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>Now, there is no man will denye, but that Dyce is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe kinds of Lot caſting. And therfore therby if not in plaine tearmes, yet neceſſarilie and incluſiuelie by waye of manifeſt circumſtaunce, the name and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God, is by Dyceplaye expreſſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and blaſphemouſlie diſhonored.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>Secondly, they ſay, this kinde of Play is reproueable, for that it is vſed and inſtituted contrarie to the true nature and end of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme.
<pb facs="tcp:14435:51"/>
For, ſeeing that the ende and ſcope of Play is or ſhould be, either to exerciſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie of the mynde, or els to cheriſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue the ſtrength and powers of the bodie: truely Dyceplay is moſt farre from either of them both. For therein wee neither exerciſe the Bodie, as wee doe in Wreſtling or Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yea wee many tymes therein doe not ſo much as ſtirre or mooue our Bodie, nor any part of the ſame, excepting our hands and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: but rather ſit ſtill gaping and ſtaying for the chaunce of the Dyce, ſitting in the meane while like idle Drones playing al the day, and giuing our ſelues to no maner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie in the worlde: in ſo much that many tymes for a iuſt reward of this our loytering occupation, we are paied home with the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous payne of the Gowtes and other Ioynt diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>And as for induſtrie of the mynde, who can ſay, that Dyceplayers doe vſe or increaſe any at all? ſeeing that in this play there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exerciſe for the witte at all: but all the hope of victory and winning, dependeth vpon Chaunce: in ſo much, that the Winner many tymes is driuen to wonder how hee wanne, and for the winning of any hande or ſtake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, cannot (in certaintie) any thing at al
<pb facs="tcp:14435:52"/>
aſſure himſelfe. And thus alſo it commeth to paſſe, that he which goeth away a looſer, doth not ſo much meruaile, as chafe and fret that he hath loſt: ſeeing that he could not perceiue (in that conqueſt and victorie made on him) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of induſtrie or ouerreaching wit in the Winner. And therfore they ſit the longer and playe thereat the eigerlier, for that they cannot ſee any probable reaſon, nor yeeld any ſufficient cauſe either of their winning, or of their looſing. Whereupon they cannot mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and ſatiſfie themſelues herein, but the more they play, and the longer they continue thereat, the greedier they are, and the willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to hold out: for that, in this wretched and ſlouthfull idlenes, they perceiue neither their bodies wearied, nor their mindes exerciſed and occupied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>Thirdly, they alledge the Lawes of the Magiſtrate, which forbiddeth theſe Playes, as offenſiue and wicked. A lawe therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once enacted and made againſt it, this Play cannot bee vſed, nor defended without offence. And notable is that ſaying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and for this preſent purpoſe very fit to be applyed:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.13.</note>

For there is no kinde of pleaſure, which we ought ſo much to eſteeme, as therby and for the ſame to giue offence vnto our Brother. Furthermore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee altogether forbeare and for euer abſtaine from this kinde of Play, yet be there other meanes enough, whereby wee may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and decently recreate both our Bodies and alſo our Mindes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we are charged and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtle, <hi>to redeeme the tyme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Ephe. 5.16. Colo. 4.5.</note> and to beſtowe it in honeſt matters and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian exerciſes. For, when God graunteth vs tyme, and giueth vs leiſure either to reade his holie worde, to viſite the ſicke, to comfort our friends, or to doe other charitable deedes, wee ought not to omit this fit occaſion, which (according to the Prouerbe) is balde behind, but to doe the ſame quicklie and out of hand: becauſe (being forſlowed) one let or other may happen, and drawe our myndes from thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:14435:53"/>
godly actions. Yea, many cauſes may fal out, and ſo carie away our meanings, that we ſhal not afterward ſo much as once thinke of theſe our dueties, our fluggiſhneſſe and dulneſſe this way is ſo great. And therefore this our idle tyme and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient leiſure, which ought to be ſo precious vnto vs, may not ſo waſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and vnthriftilie be ſpent in Dyceplay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Fifth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>Fifthlie, the very nature of this Playe is ſuch, that aboue all other Games it hath this filthie propertie, peculiarlie entailed vnto it, to wit, that it maketh men of all others moſt idle, moſt ſluggiſh, moſt couetous, and moſt deſirous of other mens goodes, and finallie moſt loath and vnwilling to leaue it. For, with much ado can we be drawen therefrom, after we haue once ſettled our delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, partlie for that through lazineſſe of ſitting ſtill, it bringeth with it no maner of wearines or labour to the bodie: and partly for that, through the vncertaine hazard and chaunce of the Dyce (whereupon onely dependeth the whole hope of victorie) it bringeth no maner of ſound pleaſure to the mynd, nor perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the Conſcience. Therefore the looſers, ſtil hoping for better luck, &amp; chaunge of fortune (which he ſeeth eaſilie to come to paſſe and often to happen) continue play ſtill,
<pb facs="tcp:14435:53"/>
truſting to recouer their loſſes, and feeding themſelues with a greedie expectation of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable chaunce. Likewiſe, the Winners, are ſtill in hope and thinke their good lucke will continue and neuer chaunge. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that neither partie is willing to deſiſt and leaue, but perſeuer and laye on loade moſt eigerlie and earneſtlie. Whereas, in all other exerciſes either of the Bodie or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mynde, there is at length ſome ende made, and the iſſue thereof ſoone eſpied: either by reaſon of the wearineſſe of the limmes, or for the oddes of their wittes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the one plainlie perceiuing the other to be ſtronger and himſelfe the weaker, curteouſly yeeldeth himſelf, and willingly leaueth work. Dyceplay therefore hauing no ho, admitteth neither end nor meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Sixtlie,<note place="margin">The ſixth reaſon.</note> it is to bee abhorred and deteſted for the filthie couetouſneſſe and griping de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of gaine, which therin is more notoriouſly vſuall, then in any other game. Where is there more inſaciable or miſerable ſeeking to winne one an others money? Where is there ſuch gaping, which way one may defeate and wipe an other of all that he hath? Where is there moe practiſes how they maye deceiue, yea vndoe the one the other? What hard hold
<pb facs="tcp:14435:54"/>
is there to ſeeke the vtter ſpoyle and decaye one of an other? Wherein bee there moe cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tricks &amp; coſening ſhifts vſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this vile, deueliſh &amp; vngracious play? In ſo much that the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> vſeth this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <hi>Alea</hi> for deceipt,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.14.</note> craftineſſe and ſhifting deuiſes. Certes, there is no Game in the world, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more ryotous waſt of money is made then in this. None, wherein is more apparaunt proofe of wilfull and witleſſe loytering. For we haue heard of ſome, read of others, yea and knowen not a few, that by this wicked game haue played a way their Lordſhippes, Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Seigniories, Mannors, Houſes and Landes: ouer and beſides their Horſes, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, Gold, Siluer, Iewelles, houſhold ſtuffe, and all that they had beſide or could borowe. Yea, we reade of ſome, that haue ſet their own Bodies at the Stake, and throwen for the propertie of their owne ſelues at a caſt at Dyce, in ſteede of money, when they haue lacked it: and looſing the chaunce, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by themſelues, haue afterwarde lead the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder of their daies, as Slaues, in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeruitude, at the diſcretion of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. So that this kinde of Play endeth at length (as <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> ſaieth) in the lamentable
<pb facs="tcp:14435:54"/>
ouerthrowes of many noble and renowmed houſes, and bringeth many an honeſt familie to weeping cheere, when all their wealth and ſubſtaunce is thus rufullie and pitifullie ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked.</p>
                  <p>Finally, there is no kinde of Vſurie more wicked, more deteſtable, or any way compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this kind of Gaine, that is, thus dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie gotten by Dyceplay. For, here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any lending and without any labour on our part, wee get an exceſſiue gayne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable encreaſe: yea, aſmuch and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture much more then our principall ſtock that we beganne withall: and that alſo not in any long tract and proceſſe of tyme, but euen quicklie, preſentlie, and as it were in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All which, doe plainly prooue an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable kinde of Couetouſneſſe to raigne ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie in this Playe: and that a great deale worſe, then the taking of Vſury vpon Vſury: which in all Ages hath bene alwaies accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reputed for one of the vileſt and deue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheſt practiſes that could be.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all:<note place="margin">The ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th reaſon.</note> the ſeuenth reaſon why this wicked Game is to bee vtterly condemned and baniſhed out of the ranke and number of all honeſt and Chriſtian diſportes is: becauſe the ſame is vſuallie accompaignied with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb facs="tcp:14435:55"/>
blaſpheming of Gods moſt holy name, terrible banning and curſing, ſpightfull cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and rayling, curſed inuocation and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Deuill, dreadfull and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble denyings and defyings of God himſelfe, &amp; rechleſſe miſregarding of his ſeuere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: al which horrible outragious enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſo incident to this moſt helliſh Dyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, that they are ſeldome or neuer aſunder from it. Which thing the Emperour <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
by an authentical law thereupon made, doth manifeſtly and plainly giue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande. Whereupon, Dyceplay grewe ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the iudgements of all good &amp; godlie perſons, that order was taken and by lawe confirmed, that the places and houſes where it was vſed, were commaunded and adiudged firſt to bee conſiſked and forfeited, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to bee vtterly ruinated and throwen downe: and commaundement giuen that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer afterward any man ſhould dwell therein: becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauie wrath of God was thought to be ſtill ouer that place.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I might here bring a great many of other hurtes and miſchieues occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hereby: but what neede we moe? ſeeing thoſe that we haue alreadie alledged, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (as we hope) to perſwade all honeſt and
<pb facs="tcp:14435:55"/>
well giuen mindes, that both can and haue learned to be ruled by reaſon, and to liſten to Chriſtian inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſtubborne crewe of wilfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons borne rather to purſue beaſtly pleaſures and ſauage ſenſualitie, then to embrace hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſocietie and honeſt orders, there can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuffice at all. To perſwade therefore ſuch monſtruous people wee will not goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, for we knowe therein we ſhall but looſe our labour. Wee rather thinke ſuch Ding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftes and Makeſhiftes worthie to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſlie puniſhed by the Magiſtrate with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie and many penalties both pecuniarie and corporal, and by ſeueritie of Lawes to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and reſtrayned from this Play. Other reaſons a great ſort, to confirme ſo much as we haue here ſayed, are alledged and cited by that reuerend man <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Commentaries vpon the Booke of <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

                  <p>Secondly they obiect vnto vs: That they ſee no harme to growe by this Playe, ſo that there hee no ſwearing, no blaſpheming, no chaſing nor couetouſneſſe therein vſed. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper and fine exception (I promiſe you) and wittilie by them alledged. As though the playing for money, can poſſibly bee without ſome ſpyce of couetouſneſſe, or deſire of gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that which is an other mans?

And although beeing blinded in their owne follie, they thinke not of this geare preſently, yet ſhall they hereafter (if they ſpeedilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, and turne ouer the leaſe into a newe leſſon) feele by experience the ſmart of their deſertes, and ſhall finde this our admonition and ſaying to be moſt true and certaine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſay and aduouch, that Dyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play is not ſimply, and of it ſelfe, harmefull or reprooueable: but only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the immoderate &amp; exceſſiue vſe thereof is to be condemned and diſallowed, and ſuch Dycing houſes and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling houſes as purpoſelie ſerue for this idle and loytering trade.

as the place condemned, and expreſſely in the Law forbidden? And whence proceedeth this ordinarie and immoderate cuſtome of Play, but from theſe ſmall beginninges at the firſt, which muſt therefore bee cut away and auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>And whereas they further ſay, that there is a Vertue (called in Greek <hi>Eutrapelia,</hi> and in Engliſh Curteſie) which conſiſteth in mens ſporting and recreating themſelues together: I affirme likewiſe that there is ſuch a vertue in deed: but that it alloweth any man to play at any lewde and vnlawfull Games (ſuch as Dyceplaye is) I vtterly denye: for it reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth onely ſuch, as are warrantable by the right rule of Honeſtie.

<pb facs="tcp:14435:58"/>
places in the Scriptures, expreſſely making mention thereof, and that with as great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deteſtation as poſſibly can be. The firſt is in the <hi>Pſalmes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 22 19</note> The other in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell after <hi>S. Iohn:</hi> where it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.24.</note> that they played for our Sauiour Chriſtes Coate, and <hi>that they caſt lottes</hi> (which was Dyce) who ſhould haue it. And truely this Game is a wide windowe, and almoſt the firſt gappe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all looſenes and diſſoluteneſſe of maners, which Sathan to diſturbe the vnitie of the Church, is wont commonly to ſet wide open.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, and to make an ende, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this our preſent Treatiſe, with that place of that auncient Father <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Booke <hi>de Alea,</hi> wherein he plainlie ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that Sathan the Deuill was the firſt deuiſer of this Play. For, when as Sathan the Enemie of Mankinde went about deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to roote &amp; imprint Idolatrie in the hearts of men: and to make it an ordinarie Gheſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at Banquets, Diſportes and Meriments, to the ende that hee might thereby the more freely raigne and carie rule among them, and bring them to his lure by a kinde of pleaſure, (or as it were a ſweete poyſon) he deuiſed and hatched this deteſtable and wicked kinde of Game.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14435:59"/>And therefore the Kinges, Queenes and Verlettes which are now with vs the Coate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardes, were in olde tyme and at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Images of Idolles, and were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the very names of the Idolles and falſe Gods themſelues. Which now ſince, becauſe men be Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they haue (for ſtark ſhame) ſkowred, burniſhed, and newe furbiſhed the names thereof onely, but as for the plauſible memoriall and very monument it ſelfe of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, is ſtill retayned. For, becauſe they would not be thought to imitate the Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Idolatrie of the other, and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe maintaine the playe it ſelfe, they haue chaunged thoſe olde Idolatrous names and Images, and call them now by the names of <hi>Charlemaine, Launcelot, Hector,</hi> or ſome other valiaunt Captaines, Dukes or Kings: but (as I aforeſayd) the thing it ſelfe, and the vſe of this Deueliſh deuiſe they kepe ſtill, and doe diſguiſe the horrible inconuenience gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen thereby, vnder the cloake of ſuch gaye tearmes, to the no ſmal daunger of Idolatrie among Chriſtians euen at this day.</p>
                  <p>The name therefore is onely chaunged, that is to ſay, the colour, phiſnamie, purtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and countenaunce, but the thing it ſelfe, together with the lewdneſſe and beaſtlineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:14435:59"/>
hereof, remaineth the ſelfe ſame, and is al one and alike among all ſuch Chriſtians, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelues to Dyceplay.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that it hath here beene prooued and ſufficientlie ſhewed, that Dyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play is directly and flatly repugnaunt to the written word of God, vtterly harmefull and pernicious to the Players and Gameſters themſelues: accompanied &amp; fraughted with ſuch a ſorte of diſcommodities and offences: contrary to all good Lawes: ſweruing from all wholeſome eſtabliſhed orders: offering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaunce to all reformation: bidding battaile to all honeſtie: and finally beeing nothing els, then (as it were) the moſt filthie excrements and helliſh inuention of Sathan the Deuill, there is no Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needeth to doubt, but that he ought with all endeuour to abandon, forſake, renounce, defye, and vtterly to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from it.</p>
