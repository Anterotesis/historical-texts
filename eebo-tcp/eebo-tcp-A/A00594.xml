            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the other by M. <hi>Crompton,</hi> deserveth a
thankfull acknowledgement of all that
were any way interessed in the making
or setting forth of those Bookes. The
speciall passages of his Majesties learned
and pious discourses upon that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I have here, though not perfectly yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21360:6"/>
faithfully related.<note place="margin">Pind.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>First, his Majestie questioned me for
licensing M. <hi>Elton</hi> his booke, and hee
seemed to be very much displeased that
any should be permitted to print books
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who were
not conformable to the discipline of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Whereunto my
conscience beareth me witnesse that my
answer was according to the truth.</p>
            <p>First, that M. <hi>Elton</hi> had set forth in
print other books before this, at which
I never heard any exception taken for
matter of inconformitie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that if he had beene a man
unconformable, doubtlesse my Lord of
<hi>Winton,</hi> no favourer of non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
would never have suffered him
to have discharged his Ministery so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares so neare him, without ever
calling him in question, much lesse sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
him for non-conformitie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the generall good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of M. <hi>Elton</hi> his meeke spirit and
peaceable cariage as well as his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21360:7"/>
painfulnesse in his pastorall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
even to the enfeebling of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
moved me to gratifie him so farre,
being my neighbour, as at his request
to peruse that his book, and if I thought
it fit, commend it to the Presse.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that of this booke I peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
but 52. pages, in which I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that there was nothing contrary
to the discipline or doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that my appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
extends no further then the 52.
page, appeareth by my <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> and
the Warden of the Stationers hand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
to the 52. page, and not to the last
page of the booke: at which wee usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
set our hands, if wee allow the
whole booke. After that first part of
the book allowed by me, I made a stop,
because I then understood the Author
had made a period of his life. Whilst he
lived I might and did alter with his
consent, what we thought fit: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his decease I left oft intermedling in
such a worke wherein I could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21360:7"/>
all things to passe as they were in
that copy, <hi>bonÃ¢ conscientiÃ¢,</hi> nor yet change
or mend any thing <hi>bonÃ¢ fide.</hi> Yet the
booke tooke the libertie of flie out of
the Presse without licence: But that
which then escaped <hi>virgulam censoriam,</hi>
hath since met with <hi>facem expiatoriam.</hi>
On Sunday the 13. of Februarie 1624.
we saw a <hi>februation</hi> or purging by fire
of all the errors discovered in that <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humus,</hi>
some concerning the Sabbath it
selfe, there were burnt above 800 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.
The greatest holocaust that hath
beene offered in this kinde in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
for ought I know. VVhereupon
the wits of the Citie (which usually
will be working upon such occasions)
have made a conceited Pageant: And
although even innocent mirth may bee
subject to censure, when the occasion
rather presents matter of pensive, or at
least serious thoughts; yet because the
Embleme and Motto devised upon this
occasion discovereth the affections of
many that were there present, I hold it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21360:8"/>
not altogether unfit here to set them
downe. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse is drawne
at large, and a number of men, partly
running away that they might not see
such a spectacle, partly weeping, and
wiping their eies to see a booke so full
(as they conceived) of heavenly zeale
and holy fire, sacrificed in earthly and
unhallowed flames: their Motto was,

Before the burning of the Bookes, the
Preacher at the Crosse declared divers
erroneous assertions therein, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(as he said) by Authoritie. Among
which that assertion in the fore-front,

the Sacrament to the sicke requiring it
on their death-bed, collected by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from some passages of that
booke, seemed to me most blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie.
For what law of God or man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth
the sicke in their greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of paines of body, and troubles of
minde, of that unspeakeable comfort
which the participating of the blessed
Sacrament affordeth to all that worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive it. What devout Christian
would not desire with <hi>Simeon</hi> to take
his Saviour into his hands before his
departure, that he might the more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
sing his <hi>Nunc dimittis?</hi> Is the
Church so charitable to send the other
Sacrament home to sicke infants? and
will any denie this Sacrament to men
of ripe yeares, hungring for this bread
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21360:9"/>
of life? what though this Sacrament
be not of like necessitie as the other is?
yet is it of as great vertue, and greater
comfort, by present apprehension:
wherof men stand in great need amidst
the temptations of Satan, and terrors of
conscience, and feare of death, and the
strict account to bee given after death.
Who knoweth not that the Primitive
Church tooke speciall care that all those
who were taking their last journey to
another world should be provided of
this celestiall Viand, which they<note n="*" place="margin">Ignat epist. ad Ephe.</note> call

                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
yet such
is the nature of misguided zeale, that
under colour of weeding out supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it will pluck up by the rootes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
plants of Paradise, and acts of true
Religion.</p>
            <p>But because M. <hi>Elton</hi> himselfe hath

out of those bookes, published
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21360:9"/>
after his death, nor enter anie action of
unkindenesse against any concerning
that businesse; but burie all in his grave:
because though some of them perhaps
intended much evil against me, yet God
(through his Majesties grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
hath turned it to good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of a marble Image of
<hi>Diana</hi> set up in Chios, the face whereof
was so drawne by Art, that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess
seemed to look sad upon her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers

copie of his Majesties countenance in
this busines, which was sad and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
at my comming to him, but cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and comfortable at my departing.
It is well knowne what a bitter storme
fell at my first appearance before his
Majestie, which yet the day following,
through Gods mercie, in whose hands
the hearts of Kings are, turned a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
shower; which fell<note n="*" place="margin">For he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 40. peeces in gold of his Majestie.</note> literally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
M. <hi>Crompton,</hi> and allegorically upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21360:10"/>
me. Seldome or never heard I (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
on the sudden) such apt solutions
of knottie and intangled questions, so
pithie and sinewie Arguments, such
usefull observations, such divine instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
from anie <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in our
Church, as I heard that day from his
Majesties mouth: Had not feare and
sorrow for his Majesties displeasure,
much crazed my memorie, and deaded
my spirits at the present, I should have
caried away more, and have given a
better account of his Majesties learned
resolutions, and pious admonitions,
given to me and M. <hi>Crompton</hi> that day:
Now I can but present <hi>bracteolas sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
purÃ¨ aurei &amp; stricturas ingenii vere
ignei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe first thing to my remembrance
questioned touching M. <hi>Cromptons</hi>
booke, was a clause in my written de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that I was rather induced to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
the booke out of a respect to my
Lord, D. his Grace, to whom the book
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21360:10"/>
is dedicated by his Chaplaine. <hi>What a
reason is this,</hi> (said his Majestie?) <hi>Is it an
honour to my Lord D. to bee a patron of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors?
Is it any honour to me that the Arians
in Polonia have dedicated one of their books
to me, containing damnable heresies? I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it rather a dishonour, and cannot with
patience looke upon their dedication to mee.</hi>
For answer hereunto I humblie besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
his Majestie, that hee would bee
pleased to heare that clause in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
entirely read unto him. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
my Lord of <hi>Durham</hi> reached me
the paper wherein I read as followeth:
<hi>That although I found many errors in M.</hi>
Crompton <hi>his booke, for which I might
have wholly rejected the booke, yet I chose
rather to purge those errors, and mend those
faults in the booke, and therein used the helpe
and advise of M.</hi> Cooke, <hi>(who lately set
forth a Treatise of the same argument, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled.</hi>
S. Austines Religion,) <hi>to the end I
might gratifie. M.</hi> Crompton <hi>out of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Duke, to whom the Booke was
dedicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21360:11"/>
The next thing examined by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
was the reason of the suppressing
three of the Authors Sections, whereof
he complaineth in Print in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his booke. My answer to this
charge was, That I crossed out those
Sections because they crossed the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
and discipline established in this
Kingdome, and savoured of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
which never yet bred good
blood in the Church. And for proofe
of my exceptions against those sections
I produced the originall copie written
with M. <hi>Cromptons</hi> owne hand, which
tendering to his Majestie, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
M. <hi>Crompton</hi> to reade the first Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
suppressed touching a paritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Clergie: Vpon the hearing
whereof his Majestie much distasting
M. <hi>Crompton</hi> his assertions, tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
fully to enucliate that question tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the distinction of Bishops and
Presbyters <hi>jure divino.</hi> Beside the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the primitive Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all ancient writers, his Majestie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21360:11"/>
much pressed the subscription of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to <hi>Titus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ordained the first Bishop of Creet.</note> and of the second Epistle
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as also the Apostles charge
to <hi>Timothie,</hi> 1. 5. 19.<note place="margin">Ordained the first Bishop of the Church of Ephesus.</note> 
               <hi>Receive not an accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against an Elder, but before two or three
witnesses.</hi> And to <hi>Titus</hi> the 1. and 5. <hi>For
this cause left I thee in Creet, to ordaine El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in everie Church.</hi> Out of which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of Scripture his Majestie so cleerly
and evidently evicted a superioritie in
Bishops over Presbyters, <hi>jure divino,</hi> that
as hee reformed master <hi>Crompton</hi> in his
opinion, so he much more confirmed
and setled my judgement in that tenet,
which I held before, and delivered in
two severall Consecration Sermons
preached in his Graces Chappel at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:
viz.</hi> That the distinction of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Presbyters is <hi>de jure divino,</hi> or
<hi>Apostolico,</hi> not <hi>de Ecclesiastico</hi> onely, and
that according to the Canon of the
great Councell of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
to bring downe
a Bishop to the low ranke of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Priests, is sacriledge. The first I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21360:12"/>
finde that ever went about to breake
downe the partition wall betweene
Bishops and Presbyters, was <hi>Aerius,</hi> a
man like his name, light and easie to be
caried away with the winde of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writeth, <hi>(Heres.
75.)</hi> this <hi>Aerius</hi> standing for a Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,
and being put by it by <hi>Eustathius,</hi>
invented this heresie, <hi>ut se consolaretur,</hi>
to comfort his heart upon the repulse:
So when he could not raise up himselfe
to the higher rank of Bishops, he sought
to pull downe Bishops to his lower
rank of Presbyters. VVhat (saith hee)
doth a Bishop differ from a Priest? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all,<note place="margin">A Bishop differs nothing at all from a Priest, for they are both of one and the same ranke and dignity.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>.
But for this sawcy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipartnesse
he felt the smart of the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers
staffe, and for ranking Bishops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Presbyters or Elders, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
ranked amongst hereticks.</p>
            <p>After this point touching different
degrees in the Clergie was discussed,
the two other suppressed sections in
M. <hi>Cromptons</hi> booke were reade, the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21360:12"/>
former touching the unlawfulnesse of
anie contract of matrimonie betweene
parties of a different Religion. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
touching the mariage of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
partie after divorce for adulterie. In
both which Sections such offensive
matter was found, that his Majestie
was pleased to say that master <hi>Crompton</hi>
was beholding to mee for suppressing
them.</p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth my defence for
striking out of those sections in master
<hi>Cromptons</hi> booke was verie easie: the
harder province was to excuse such sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which I strucke not out, for his
Majestie distasted many tenets of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Crompton,</hi> but especially insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
foure.
<q>
                  <l>First, Touching the signe of the

                  <l>Secondly, Touching womens bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing

supposed to bee in Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <l>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:21360:13"/>
Fourthly, Touching S. <hi>Augustines</hi>
opinion of Children dying without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>TOuching the signe of the Crosse
his Majestie verie much disliked
that which</hi> M. Crompton <hi>averreth, pag.
81. That</hi> the signe of the Crosse was not
received in the Church till one hundred and
sixtie yeares after Christ, and that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thereof was <hi>Valentinus</hi> the hereticke,
who comming to Rome stayed there twelve
yeares, and brought up the use of the Crosse,
as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> reporteth. This observation,
<hi>said his Majestie,</hi> is most false, the signe of
the Crosse is more ancient, <hi>Valentinus</hi>
brought it not first into the Church, neither
doth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> report any such thing.</p>
            <p>Since his Majesties speech with us, I
have examined the place alledged by <hi>M.
Crompton</hi> out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and I finde that
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirmeth no such thing as is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
upon him. <hi>Valentinus</hi> the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
was not the first inventer or author
of the signe of the Crosse, but our arch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21360:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Cartewritist,</hi> or raith <hi>Catherist Parker,</hi>
was the first inventer of this slanderous
untruth: it seemeth <hi>M. Crompton</hi> plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Parkers</hi> lame heifer, which
<hi>drew his plough-share awry.</hi> This <hi>Parker</hi>
in his booke, which he arrogantly and
affectedly intituleth, <hi>Scholasticall discourse
against symbolizing with Antichrist in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
especially in the signe of the Crosse,</hi>
pag. 75. saith, <hi>we use</hi> Valentinus <hi>his Crosse;
I call it his, because he was the first that used
this figure the verie first that made account
of it:</hi> and a few lines after, Valentinus
<hi>the hereticke being the first deviser of it:</hi> and
he quoteth (for proofe of this his bold
assertion) <hi>Ireneus</hi> in his first booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
heresies. But how grossely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he abuseth <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> will appeare by
setting down <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his owne words,
which are these, <hi>Adhuc etiam de Horo
suo, quem pluribus nominibus vocant, duas
operationes habere eum ostendunt, confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivam,
&amp; seperativam, &amp; secundÃ¹m id qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
quod confirmat &amp; stabilit Crucemesse,
secundÃ¹m id verÃ² quod dividit &amp; distinguit
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21360:14"/>
Horum esse:</hi> Further he relateth of his
fantasticall <hi>Aeon,</hi> that hee hath divers
names according to divers vertues and
operations, and giveth instance in two,
the vertue of establishing, according to
which he calleth him Crosse, and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of severing, according to which hee
is called Bound or Tearme. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
here speakes not of Christs Crosse, but
of the fantasticke <hi>Aeons</hi> Crosse; nor of
the signe of the Crosse, but of the name
of the Crosse: Neither saith he so much,
as that <hi>Valentinus</hi> was the deviser either
of the name, or of the signe, but onely
that one of his <hi>Aeons</hi> had two names:
the one <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, Terme or Bound, the other
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, or Crosse: And if wee may not
make the signe of the Crosse, because
one of <hi>Valentinus</hi> his fained <hi>Aeons</hi> was
called Crosse, by the same reason wee
may not make any bound in our fields,
nor definition of anything, because the
same <hi>Aeon</hi> was called by the heretickes
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, that is, bound or definition. And
by <hi>M. Parkers</hi> Logique, one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21360:14"/>
Pursivants must abjute his owne
name, and bee no more called <hi>Crosse,</hi>
lest hee symbolize with <hi>Valentinus,</hi> or
offend his god <hi>Aeon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> seculum crux:</hi>
yet this is one of the least absurdities in
that booke of <hi>Parker.</hi> No Scholler e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spilt so much wit and learning as
this braine-sicke Amsterdamian doth
in his Treatise of the Crosse: wherein
he layeth all his wit and learning upon
it, to prove that the making of the sign
of the Crosse is the breach of all the ten
Commandements. He is not content
to write of the <hi>Superstition and Idolatry
of the Crosse</hi> onely, which are notes we
have often heard sung by the <hi>Martines
brood;</hi> but hee spendeth 18. whole
Sections in discoursing of the <hi>hypocrisie
of the Crosse,</hi> and a whole large booke
of the <hi>Injustice of the Crosse,</hi> chap. 5. and
of the <hi>Murder of the Crosse,</hi> chap. 6. and of
the <hi>Adultery of the Crosse,</hi> chap. 7. and of
the <hi>Wrong of the Crosse,</hi> chap. 8. and of
the <hi>Slander of the Crosse,</hi> chap. 9. and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21360:15"/>
of the Crosse,</hi> chap. 10.</p>
            <p>For proofe of these his prodigious
conclusions, he so detorteth Scriptures,
and depraveth ancient and moderne
Writers, that what was said by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Epigrammatist of <hi>Gretzers</hi> booke
<hi>De adorandÃ¢ cruce,</hi> may bee applied to
this booke of <hi>Parkers De abolendÃ¢ cruce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dignum authore opus est, dignus at ille
opere est, nempe cruce.</p>
            <p>It will be here said, if this escape in
<hi>M. Cromptons</hi> book were so grosse, how
came it to passe, that it escaped my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in perusing and licensing the same?
my answer hereunto is direct, That it
did not escape mee, but I tooke notice
thereof in reading that Chapter, and
both corrected it in that place, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
In that place I inserted these
words <hi>(as some report,)</hi> thereby giving
the Reader to understand, that I avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the thing there reported, but
branded it with suspition: and <hi>pag.</hi> 84.
I determined the cleane contrary in the
conclusion of the Chapter, in these
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21360:15"/>
words following <hi>line 9. To conclude then
it is most certaine, that the signe of the crosse
was first invented and practiced against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
who used to make it onely in derision of
Christianity. The Valentinian heretickes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abused the Crosse to a fantasticall end,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. TOuching <hi>Womens baptizing in case
of necessity,</hi> his Majestie in part
disliked that which <hi>M. Crompton</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<hi>pag.</hi> 95. that for <hi>a lay man, and much
more for a woman to baptize in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
in S.</hi> Austines <hi>opinion it is a pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sinne: though pardonable, yet a sinne,
and the usurping of anothers office.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
hereunto made, as I take it, by <hi>M.
Crompton,</hi> (for I remember not that I
spake any thing at all to this point) was
that in the Conference at Hampton
Court womens baptizing was utterly
condemned: and that thereupon an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
was made in the Booke of
Common Prayer: and whereas before
women were allowed to baptize in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21360:16"/>
case of necessity, in the booke set out by
his Majestie, baptisme in private houses
in time of necessity is restrained to the
Minister of the Parish, or any other
lawfull Minister that can be procured.
Against this answer his Majestie excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>That neither in the Common Prayer
booke set out by King</hi> Edward, <hi>nor in that
by Queene</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>there was any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of womens baptizing. In King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Common Prayer Booke printed</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no

to be baptized in private houses in time of
necessity:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let them that be present call upon
God for his grace, and say the Lords
Prayer, if the time will permit, and
then one of them shall name the childe,
and dip it in the water, or powre wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon it, saying these words, <hi>N. I
baptize thee, &amp;c.</hi> and let them not
doubt but that the childe so baptized
is lawfully and sufficiently baptized.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21360:16"/>

Dom.</hi> 1552. hath the same ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
verbatim: Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
booke hath likewise the same words:
The booke set out upon the conference
at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, hath altered it
on this wise: Of them that are to be
baptized in priuate houses, in time of
necessity, by the Minister of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
or any other lawfull Minister
that can be procured, First, let the
lawfull Minister, and them that bee
present, call upon God for his grace,
and say the Lords prayer, if the time
will suffer, and then the childe being
named by some one that is present,
the said lawfull Minister shall dip it
in water, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In all which passages, in all the severall
Impressions of the bookes of Common praier,
there is nothing said of a womans baptizing,
neither to warrant it to be done, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it when it is done. Neither doth S.
<hi>Austine</hi> simply condemne a Lay man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
baptizing in case of necessitie, as a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21360:17"/>
sinne, but saith, either it is no fault, or a
pardonable. His words, <hi>Tom. quarto,
lib. 2. contra. Epist. Parmenionis,</hi> are,
<hi>Nulla cogente necessitate si fiat, alieni

And this said his Maiestie was the summe of
the resolution at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court in this
point, howsoever some have mistaken it.</p>
            <p>3. TOuching <hi>some kinde of ignorance
supposed to bee in Christ according
to his humane nature;</hi> His Majestie
disallowed Master <hi>Cromptons</hi> peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
resolution, set downe <hi>pag.</hi> 23, viz.
<hi>That Christ as man was subject to some kind
of ignorance,</hi> and this was the Primitive
truth taught by St. <hi>Austine,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Church of <hi>England. I
cannot endure (saith his Majesty) that my
Sauiour should be said to bee ignorant of any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21360:17"/>
thing. For in him the divine nature was
hypostatically united to the humane, in one
person; and that person being divine, could
not, nor cannot bee subject to any kinde of
ignorance.</hi> Here I humbly beseeched
his Majesty to be pleased to heare what
might be probably alleaged, in defence
of <hi>M. Cromptons</hi> opinion. The rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

who said, that hee would not that wee
should ground our judgement vpon la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
writers, especially those beyond the
Seas, which were not well acquainted
with the Tenets of our Church: and
moreover differed from vs in discipline
and judgement, touching the decent,
ancient and laudible Ceremonies used
in our Church. Vpon this occasion, his
Majestie gave <hi>M. Crompton</hi> and Me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
most usefull instructions in our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21360:18"/>
study in Divinitie, agreeable to those
Directions sent heretofore to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
which deserve to bee written
with the point of a Diamond, for the
perpetuall use of the Church, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of sacred knowledge and
learning. For these Directions, having
given his Majesty thankes, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to follow them, I propounded
those words of our Saviour, <hi>Marke 13.
32. But of that day and houre knoweth no
man, no not the Angels, neither the Sonne,
but the Father;</hi> Which, as I conceived,
made for <hi>M. Cromptons</hi> opinion, <hi>viz.</hi>
That Christ, according to his humane
nature, might be said, if not subject to
ignorance, yet to a nescience of some
particulars, such as that which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Text; for, as for the Iesuits
interpretation of that Text, <hi>(viz.) That
Christ knew not the day of Iudgement, [ad
dicendum nobis,] to tell us;</hi> I never could
like of it, because it is forced, and serveth
to give support to the doctrine of
Aequivocation. <hi>Neither doe I, said his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21360:18"/>
allow of the Gloss of the Iesuites, but
you must observe, said he, that Christ said
not, that neither the Son of God doth know,
but neither the Son himselfe. And hee was
the Sonne of God as well as the son of man;
and though as man, or by his humane nature
he knew not the day of Iudgement, yet as
the Sonne of God he knew it.</hi> In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his Majesties, according to
the interpretation of the ancient fathers
<hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambros. in hunc locum, temporu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> finem non per naturam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, sed per naturam Dei novit.</note> wee rested both sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and I humbly desired his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
that hee would bee pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
us in what sense those words of
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 52.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyril. non dicit spiritum sanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, sed Angelos, &amp; filium; nec fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Dei, sed fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um solummodo, de seipso loquens ut homine; nec sibi derogans ut Deo. scit enim, ut Deus, quod ut homo ignorat.</hi> He knew the end of time, not by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, but by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God. Hee saith not, the Holy Ghost knoweth not, but that the Angels know it not, nor the Son: neither doth he say, the Son of God knoweth not, but onely the Son knoweth not; speaking of himselfe as man, and not derogating fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> himselfe as God, for he knoweth that as God, which as man he is ignorant of.</note> were to bee taken;
<hi>And Iesus increased in wisedome, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and favour with God and man.</hi> For
if Christ increased in wisedome and
knowledge, he had then more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in his riper yeares, then hee had in
his Infancy; and if he had lesse know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in his younger yeares then in his
elder, it seemeth that we may without
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21360:19"/>
any disparagement to his omniscience,
according to his divine nature, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
comparative ignorance, or rather
nescience to him, according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature. This knot his Majesty
thus dexterously untied. In the same
verse, saith his Majiesty, it followeth,
<hi>That he increased in favour with God: now
saith he, was not Christ alwayes in highest
and greatest favour with God? Did God
favour and love him more at one time then
another? Doubtless not, yet is he said truly
to increase in favour with God, because God
more manifested &amp; declared his love &amp; favor
unto him by the effects, and outward tokens
thereof; as he grew in yeares, so likewise
may he be said to grow and increase in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and knowledge, because he more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
and declared his wisedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as he came to riper age.</hi> To this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his Majesty, I replyed; I
could not imagine any thing that might
with any colour be objected against it,
save onely that it is said in the same
place, <hi>That Iesus increased in wisedome,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21360:19"/>
and stature,</hi> but his growth and increase
in stature was not onely in appearance
to the world, but in truth and properly,
and therefore his growth, and increase
in wisedome might be conceived to be
reall, and in inward habit, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in outward manifestation thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this his Majestie sayd,</hi> that these
words, <hi>He increased in wisedome,</hi> may
as wel be interpreted by the other, <hi>He grew
in favor,</hi> as by these, <hi>He grew in stature,</hi>
yet said he, Christ might also be said truly to
<hi>increase in wisedome, and knowledge</hi>
in himselfe, as hee did <hi>in stature;</hi> If wee
speake of experimentall knowledge, whereof
S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Heb 5. 6. <hi>That he learned
obedience by the things he suffered;</hi> but
from this increase in experimentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
none could inferre any ignorance at all
in Christ, because, though he knew not some
things experimentally in his Infancy, which
he knew afterwards in his riper yeares, yet
he knew the selfe same things before other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by his divine knowledge, and by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitall
infused humane.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:21360:20"/>
               <hi>The last point questioned by his
Majestie in</hi> M. Cromptons <hi>book, was
his undertaking to vindicate St.</hi> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
<hi>from the imputatioon of being</hi>
durus pater infantum, <hi>a hard censurer of
poore children dying unbaptized;
whom hee excludeth from all hope of
salvation. Although saith his Majesty,</hi>
I like it better especially in a yong Divine,
to endevour to defend an ancient Father,
where the truth will bear it, then like <hi>Cham</hi>
to seeke to discouer the nakednesse of the
Fathers; Yet I like not your defence of Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> in this particular, because it is a
knowne errour in him, and you ought to have
observed three Caveats in reading of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
and other ancient Fathers workes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> You should observe what they write
out of their private opinion, and what
they deliver as the Iudgement of the
Church. When any of them goe alone,
it is not so safe following them, but
where wee have their unanimous and
joynt consent in any materiall point,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21360:20"/>
we may more securely relie upon them.
All the Iesuites in the world shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to produce the unanimous
consent of the Fathers against us; or
for themselves in any substantiall
point of Faith, as I have maintained
in my bookes against them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That you should distinguish
what the Fathers write dogmatically,
and what rhetorically: For sometimes
they may straine somewhat too far in
flourish of exornation and we ought
to make the best, not the worst of their
sayings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You should observe what they
deliver in rofessed discourse, and for
positive doctrine, and what they write
in heate of opposition; wherein some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
through too much vehemency
they over straine in their polemicall
tractates against Heretickes; For
instance, in this very point S. <hi>Austin</hi>
in his worthy treatises, extant in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21360:21"/>
seventh Tome of his workes, in vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
oppuguing those <hi>Heretickes,
that agree with our Arminians,</hi>
(to wit) the Pelagians, who denyed
originall sinne in Infants and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the necessity of Baptisme, was
so farre transported to urge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
thereof, that hee excludeth all
Infants dying unbaptized from all
hope of salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether his Majesty received these
Observations from any ancient Father,
or late judicious Writer: Or whether
the same spirit which directed them
immediately, instructed him, I know
not. But after I tooke a note of these
Cautions joyntly from his Majesties
mouth, I found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> severally delivered
by divers renowned Authors. The first
by</hi> Vincentius Lirinensis adversus hareses.

and <hi>Chrysostome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last Caution his Majesty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
with great S. <hi>Basil,</hi> who noteth it of
<hi>Dionysius,</hi> that he gave the first occasion

<hi>Not out of any evill minde he had

an over vehement desire to contradict
and confute</hi> Sabellius. <hi>Sixtus Senen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and <hi>Vasques</hi> ingenuously confesse,
that many of the ancient Fathers, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the <hi>Manichean</hi> Heresie of
fatalitie, spake too freely of mens free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.
And doth not St. <hi>Ierome</hi> in heate
of opposition to <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> who too
much undervalued Virginitie, runne
somewhat upon the other extreame,
by too highly extolling the same, even
to the disparaging (in some sort) of
holy wedlocke? It cannot likewise be
denyed, but that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> was
caried too farre in the point in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21360:22"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>:
Not out of any evill mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
but out of opposition to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi>
his Heresie. In censuring <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
his Heresie, he goeth so farre in ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the absolute necessity of Baptisme,
that he holdeth all children dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized
in the state of damnation. For
which his severe censure of poore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
hee is called <hi>durus pater Infantum.</hi>
And this, said his Majestie, I learned
when I was but 22. yeares old, and
therefore marvell that a Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
and a Writer against Papists
should bee ignorant thereof. My an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
hereunto was, I was not ignorant,
that no children dying unbaptized, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to S. <hi>Austines</hi> opinion, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
were, or could bee saved. And in
this regard, hee might justly bee called,
<hi>durus pater Infantum.</hi> But yet I could
not thinke S. <hi>Austine</hi> so severe against
poore Infants, as to denie, but that some
children dying without Baptisme, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
borne of religious parents,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21360:23"/>
might by the extraordinary mercy of
God be saved, as the Thiefe was upon
the Crosse, without receiving that, or
the other Sacrament, and for proofe of
this my opinion touching St. <hi>Austine,</hi> I
alledged these words out of his fourth
book <hi>de baptismo contra Donatistas, ca. 24.
Sicut in illo latrone quod ex baptismi sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento
deficerat complevit omnipotentis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitas,
quia non superbiÃ¢, aut contemptu,
sed necessitate defuerat; sic in ijs infantibus,
qui non baptisati moriuntur, eadem gratia
omnipotentis implere credenda est.</hi> Of this
place of Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> his Majestie said,
<hi>That the words were misalleaged, that Saint</hi>
Austines <hi>words were not,</hi> [Sic in infanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,
qui non baptizati moriuntur,] <hi>but</hi>
sic in infantibus, qui baptisati moriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tur,
eadem omnipotentis gratia implere
credenda est. Hereunto craving leave
to speake what I could, with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
yet to his Majesties better Iudgment,
I said, that I thought, the former reading
was the truer, because there was never
any question of the salvation of Infants
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21360:23"/>
borne of faithfull parents, which dyed
being baptized; Neither seemed there
to me any good correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the parts of the similitudes, If
we read the words without the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
particle thus: As the thiefe upon
the Cross by the extraordinary mercy of
God was saved without baptisme, so
Infants are saved dying with bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
by the mercie of God. Moreover
the reason which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> here ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to prove the thiefe on the Crosse
was saved without baptisme, because
he contemned not baptisme, makes as
strongly or more strongly for infants,
who questionlesse cannot bee thought
any way to contemne baptisme. If ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
excuse the thiefe on the Crosse,
it seemeth that the same necessity in S.
<hi>Augustines</hi> judgement might excuse In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
for the want of baptisme. To
this his Majestie answered, <hi>That the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
in S.</hi> Austine <hi>stood thus, That as
the thiefe on the Crosse was saved without
baptisme, because the want thereof was of
necessity, and not of contempt, so also chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21360:24"/>
that are baptised are saved by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
mercy of God, without actuall
faith and confessing thereof.</hi> And to prove
this to be S. <hi>Augustines</hi> meaning, hee
commanded my Lord of <hi>Durham</hi> to
reade the words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which are these: <hi>QuÃ²d non ex impia
voluntate, sed ex aetatis indigentia, nec cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
credere ad justitiam possunt, nec ore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteri
ad salutem.</hi> Which words, when I
heard read, I confessed that his Majesty
had more exactly viewed the place,
with the severall editions, than I; and
that not onely the Authors, but the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censers
of bookes were subject to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
especially in variety of Editions
of the same Author.</p>
            <p>And here as I beganne to intreat his
Majesties favourable construction of
what I had said in all this defence of my
selfe and <hi>M Crompton,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
prevented me herein, &amp; his Majesty
graciously reached me out his hand to
kisse; and thus with fatherly admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and benedictions also, he dismist
us both.</p>

            <head>THE
PRINTER TO
THE READER.</head>
            <p>COurteous Reader, this Relation inclosed
in a Letter to the D. of W. was shewed to
King <hi>Iames</hi> our late Soveraigne of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
memorie and order was given by his Majesty
for the present printing thereof: it was licenced
for the Presse, and entred for my Copie, Ian. 19.
1625. with an Epistle Dedicatory prefixed to his
most excellent Majestie that now is, shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Coronation. Since which time (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
not urging the printing thereof) I let it lye
by me, and imployed my selfe in printing divers
other bookes which were then more sought after;
whereby I hoped in some measure to repaire that
exceeding great losse which I sustained by <hi>Fire,</hi>
in the burning of M. <hi>Elton</hi> his booke on the ten
Commandements, and Lords Prayer, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
losse (in that kinde) that ever any Stationer
received: for I had taken from me almost nine
hundred bookes, bound and in quires. which
(with my<note n="*" place="margin">Albeit for my releasement I was and will acknowledge my selfe much obliged to a great and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelate in this Church.</note> Imprisonment, and other charges)
cost me above threescore and ten pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:21360:25"/>
And though I have since beene beholding to
my good friends for some good Copies, that would
have helped to make me whole againe, (if they
might have passed freely without checke or rub)
yet I found, to my great disadvantage, that the
Informer, who so persecuted M. <hi>Elton</hi> after his
death, held on his course to calumniate the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of my friends living, and to procure them
either to be altogether suppressed or to be so gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and mangled, that the sale of them thereby
was very much hindred: Neither was hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to doe me and my friends this wrong while
he hovered here about London for such preyes,
but since his flight into the <hi>North,</hi> he triumphed
and boasted at the table of a great personage, that
<hi>he had procured</hi> Pelagius Redivivus <hi>to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in, and utterly suppressed; and that 300.
of them were taken from the Printer.</hi> But
herein hee was not his crafts-master, but was
<hi>Cousened</hi> himselfe: for though a great number
of the Copies of that Worke were taken from me,
upon his clamor, and delivered to the Bishop of
London that then was, yet they were all given me
backe againe: and by the stirre hee made about
them, they were much more inquired after and
sold the better, being called for even from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest
parts of Scotland.</p>
            <p>As for this Relation, I feare not his, nor any
