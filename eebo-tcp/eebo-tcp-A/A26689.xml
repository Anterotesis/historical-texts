            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> I. WHerein should Christians be singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in their obedience? Or what
may they, and must they do more
then others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Take the Answer in these 16 <hi>Rules</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Character and Compass of a Christian.—</p>
               <p>Rule I. <hi>Heartily to love them that slight you,</hi> and
to wish <hi>and seek the good of those that hate you, and
seek to hurt you:</hi> This is the very thing urged in
the Text: <hi>If you salute your brethren only and love
them that love you, do not even the Publicans the
same?</hi> Matth. 5. 44, 46. To love them that do
respect and value us, this every one can do: but
to love them truly that <hi>think meanly of us,</hi> and
have prejudices and hard thoughts against us, and
to speak well of them that speak evil of us, (as the
sweet spirited <hi>Calvin, [Let</hi> Luther <hi>call me Dog or
Devil, I will say of him nevertheless, he is a precious
servant of Christ Iesus.]</hi> This is to do more then
others. Thus the Martyr <hi>Cranmer,</hi> of whom it
was a Proverb, [<hi>Do the Bishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
and you shall ever have him your friend.</hi>]
Thus that Holy Man in his much to be admired
parting words [<hi>I had never any greater pleasure in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64323:3"/>
all my life then to forget and forgive injuries, and to
shew kindness to them that sought evil to me.</hi>] Study
who have offended you, and disobliged you, and
slighted you, and keep up good thoughts of them
(if the case will bear it) and speak nothing but good
of them, and think what kindness you may shew
them: <hi>pray for them; wish well to them; so shall you
be the children of your Father which is in Heaven,</hi>
Mat. 5. 45.</p>
               <p>Rule II. <hi>To swim against the stream of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:</hi>
The <hi>dead fish</hi> will swim <hi>with,</hi> but the
<hi>living against</hi> the stream: Many will turn <hi>Iews</hi>
when their interest will carry it in the world:
when religion is the fashion every one will be in
it: But to bear head against the current of the
times, and to be for strict Godliness in all your
ways, when the stream runs quite against it, to
bear it down, and to resolve as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>to be yet
more vile,</hi> this is to be, and do more then others.
The <hi>Samaritanes</hi> will needs be <hi>Iews,</hi> when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
favours and helps them, but when <hi>Antiochus</hi>
bloodily rages against them (as in the time of the
<hi>Maccabees</hi>) then they will be none of the kin, but
pretend themselves to be of another stock: (Which
by the way, was the reason of the deadly hatred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
between the <hi>Iews</hi> and them). But to be
singular in your good choice and resolutions with
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> though all should vote against you with
one consent, and with <hi>Noah</hi> to be <hi>perfect in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations</hi>
when never so wicked and so adulterous;
and <hi>to walk with God</hi> when all flesh have corrupted
their way, and tread a contrary course; this is to
do more then others. Thus the three Children
(or rather the three Champions) who would not
fear the flouts of the multitude, nor the frowns of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64323:3"/>
the great ones, nor the charge of singularity, but
when all the Princes, Governours, Captains, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,
Sheriffs, and all the People, Nations and
Languages fell down and worshipped, they stood
by themselves and would not sinfully comply,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 3, 7, 18.</p>
               <p>Rule III. <hi>To take most care of that which is most
out of sight.</hi> A Christians eye is most on the things
least seen; first <hi>upon his heart,</hi> herein he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the righteousness of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> whose great
care was to keep all fair and clean that came to
view, but looked no farther: Make great consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of your carriage in secret, and let your main
guard be upon your hearts, and this will be more
then others reach to. This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s care to
keep his conscience, his inside clean and undefiled,
<hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16. And <hi>Iob's</hi> care that though all the
world did reproach him, he might not put a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
into the mouth of his conscience, <hi>Iob</hi> 27.
6. and <hi>David</hi>'s care that his heart might be clean.
2. <hi>Vpon his hope.</hi> Others look to the things <hi>seen,</hi>
things in <hi>hand.</hi> but the true believer eyes his
<hi>hopes,</hi> walks by <hi>faith,</hi> not by sight; and lives
quite a different life from any others in the world
besides; As living upon the hopes of Heaven, doth
differ from living on the pleasures, profits, and
honours of this world.</p>
               <p>Rule IV. <hi>To be merciful to others failings, and
very severe to our own.</hi> The noble Romane <hi>Cato</hi>
could more easily forgive any then himself: To
aggravate our <hi>own evils,</hi> and to have an <hi>excuse</hi>
ready for our brothers; to censure our selves free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to come with the mantle behind us to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our <hi>brother;</hi> this is to do more than others.
The hypocrite is a severe censurer abroad: he is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64323:4"/>
like the eye that can see any thing but it self: he
can discern a moat in his brothers eye, but not a
beam in his own. But the servant of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
others with meekness, but falls out <hi>easily</hi>
and bitterly with himself.</p>
               <p>Rule V. <hi>To suffer rather then to sin:</hi> This was
<hi>Moses</hi> choice: But the hypocrites is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
he chooseth iniquity rather then affliction:
To go so far with Christ as our way lies together,
is to do no more then an unsound Professour may
reach to: The tryal is when Christs interest and
ours do cross; and we must either baulk our duty
or our safety and advantage. The famous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
under <hi>Iulian,</hi> would not give one half-penny
towards the building of the Idols Temple, though
he was offered his life by the Emperour on those
terms. The godly High Priest <hi>Eleazer</hi> when the
Nobles perswaded him to eat <hi>other meat under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of swines flesh,</hi> and they would perswade the
King <hi>Antiochus</hi> that he had eaten swines flesh,
would die rather then stain his profession with the
appearance of evil. When a man shall lie in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
misery and have a door of deliverance open,
if he will but sin, and yet he will not accept it, as
those worthies in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Martyrology; this is to
do more then others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 36.</p>
               <p>Rule VI. <hi>To rejoyce in losses for Christ, and glory
in the Cross:</hi> When others be discouraged at the
news of hardship; as that forward and seemingly
resolved Disciple; or shall be offended assoon as the
Sun of persecution is up. We shall <hi>take pleasure in
infirmities,</hi> in <hi>tribulations,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> that we are
<hi>counted worthy</hi> to <hi>suffer</hi> shame for the name of
Christ; This is to do more then others. When
the servants of God shall not only <hi>patiently,</hi> but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64323:4"/>
                  <hi>triumphantly</hi> undergo the Crosses, that crack the
brains, and break the hearts of others, and shall
shake off the Viper without receiving any hurt;
when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> shall <hi>sing in the stocks,</hi> and the
resolved <hi>Martyrs</hi> shall embrace the Faggots &amp; kiss
the Stake: When the Valiant <hi>Philpot</hi> shall say of
his Prison [<hi>In the judgment of the world we are in
Hell, but I find in it the sweet consolations of Heaven:</hi>]
and the Holy <hi>Bradford [My Prison is sweeter to me
then any Parlour, then any pleasure I have had in all
my life.]</hi> This is indeed to exceed others.</p>
               <p>Rule VII. <hi>To be good when we shall be evil spoken
of for our labour.</hi> A <hi>Pharisee</hi> will do those duties
that will gain applause with men, but to take up
with despised duties, disgraceful duties, and with
<hi>David</hi> to be religious, when it will render him
<hi>Vile,</hi> this is to do more then others. The <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi>
could say, <hi>It is noble indeed for a man to do well
when he knows he shall hear ill for it.</hi> To take up
Religion when every one kicks it off: to stand up
alone with <hi>Luther</hi> for the truth, when the whole
world is gone a wandring after the Whore. To
have his hand against every man, and to be for
Christ with <hi>Athanasius</hi> against the whole Universe,
this is indeed to do some singular thing.</p>
               <p>Rule VIII. <hi>To strike in with Gods interest when
it is falling.</hi> To joyn our selves to the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
when its the weakest side: To espouse their
interest with <hi>Moses,</hi> when they were in deep affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 26. To own our selves to be
some of them, undauntedly, when <hi>this way is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where spoken against;</hi> this is to tread Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes
to the course of this world.</p>
               <p>Rule IX. <hi>To be most cruel to the sin that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
most dear.</hi> The hypocrite hides his sweet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64323:5"/>
morsels under his tongue: he spares as it were the
fattest of the Cattel: he saith, <hi>The Lord pardon
his servant concerning this thing:</hi> But when a man
shall <hi>off with his right hand, out with the right eye,</hi>
serve his <hi>Absolon</hi> as <hi>Ioab</hi> did, when he took three
darts, and thrust thorow his heart, this is to do
more then others. The sincere Christian is most
angry with the sin of his temper, against this he
aims the arrows of all his prayers: he <hi>keeps him from
his iniquity:</hi> he drives the whole herd of sin before
him, but especially shoots at and singles out this
to run it down.</p>
               <p>Rule X. <hi>To live upon the divine promises when
others live upon their possessions.</hi> Others are all
for what is <hi>in hand,</hi> with them words are but
wind; they cannot live upon them: the promises
are to them <hi>a barren heath and dry breasts:</hi> but
when we make the <hi>promises</hi> our <hi>heritage,</hi> the staff
of our life, the life of our hearts, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are the bottle we run to in all our faintings;
and while others hope in their <hi>Wealth,</hi> our hope
is in the <hi>Word,</hi> this is to do more then others.</p>
               <p>Rule XI. <hi>To love that best and choose it soonest,
which doth cross the flesh most?</hi> The godly mans rule
is, <hi>to take the self-denying side,</hi> so he be sure it be <hi>safe:</hi>
when others study is <hi>to please themselves,</hi> his is to
<hi>curb himself:</hi> the life of others is a <hi>flesh-pleasing,</hi>
his a <hi>self-denying</hi> life: others joy is, when they
can <hi>gratifie themselves,</hi> his when he can get <hi>victory
over himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rule XII. <hi>To be most hot in that wherein self is
least concerned. Paul</hi> is meek as a lamb under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
injuries, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 12. Acts</hi> 17. 16. but how
is his spirit stirred when God is dishonoured? A
man of understanding is of a cool spirit, that is, in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64323:5"/>
his <hi>own concerns:</hi> but <hi>Moses</hi> the meek waxes hot
with indignation at the sight of the calf. To be
hot and forward in those duties where the fleshes
interest is concerned, is to do no more then a <hi>Iehu,
2 Kings</hi> 10. 16, 30.</p>
               <p>Rule XIII. <hi>To make true conscience of the least sins,
but most conscience of the greatest.</hi> In one of these
will the hyhocrite be found tardy: It may be he
will fly from open sins and startle at gross staring
sins; but of <hi>little</hi> sins he makes little conscience,
This he allows of and connives at. Or else he will
be very tender of <hi>little things,</hi> scruple the picking
the ears of corn on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> or the curing
of the sick, and strain at the gnat; when he will
in other things swallow a camel; devour widows
houses. The sincere will indulge no sin; grieves
for, groans under, cryes out feelingly against his
very infirmities, but <hi>most</hi> dreads what God most
hates.—</p>
               <p>Rule XIV. <hi>To allow your selves in the neglect of
no duty, but to reserve your zeal for the duties of most
weight.</hi> To tythe mint, and cummin, and neglect
judgment, mercy and faith; to be zealous for
humane Ceremonies, Ordinances, and mens Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and omit the weightier matters of the
Law, is right the <hi>Pharisees</hi> guise, <hi>Matth. 23. 23.
Matth.</hi> 15. 2. To eye both the Tables, to joyn
sweetly together morality and piety, to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
with Men, but not careless of God; to give
to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things that be <hi>Caesars,</hi> but first to give
to God the things that be Gods, this is to do more
then others. The sincere Christian hath respect
to all Gods Commandments, walks in all his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
he is throughout with God, but he is most
zealous in those things that lie next the heart of
religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64323:6"/>Rule XV. <hi>To love your Reprovers.</hi> Herein <hi>David</hi>
doth more then <hi>Ahab,</hi> see their contrary frames,
1 <hi>Kings 22. 8. Psal.</hi> 141. 5.</p>
               <p>Rule XVI. <hi>To subject all your worldly interest to
your Makers glory,</hi> and perform holy duties with
holy ends, and while others do their best actions
with carnal aims; you must do your common and
civil actions with heavenly aims.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How we may know whether we be, and
do more then others that are unsound?</p>
               <p>I shall answer this Question by propounding
eight Questions to you, beseeching you to retire
to the most solemn and strict examination, and
make conscience to give a clear answer to these
few Interrogatories, and that will resolve the
Case.</p>
               <p>Q. I. <hi>When others do pick and choose, have you
respect to all Gods Commandments?</hi>—The hypocrite
may have great respect to the <hi>comforts,</hi> but he hath
little to the <hi>commands</hi> of Religion: He is much for
the priviledges and promises: little for the <hi>Precepts</hi>
and Duties: He is partial in the Law: he will take
but here and there where he likes, and where Gods
commands will serve his interest: or at least will
not pinch too hard upon the flesh. The sound
Christian sets all Gods commands before him:
He eyes all his copy; and heartily designs and
studies a throughout conformity: He hath no
starting holes, nor <hi>contrived haunts;</hi> nor doth he
halt between the Lord and <hi>Baal;</hi> nor serve two
Masters: He doth not fear the Lord and serve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gods; nor divides his service between God
and Mammon, but he is all for uniformity and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64323:6"/>
entirely devoted to Gods service, and fear alone:
He hath a good conscience, willing in all things
to live honestly, and doth truly, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
forsake all his sins and keep all Gods sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
that are known to him: Let me therefore
ask you two questions. (1.) When others divide
the Tables, do you sweetly conjoyn them in your
practice? The hypocrite it may be is <hi>just</hi> and
<hi>square</hi> towards men, but follow him to his family
or closet; you shall find but little of God: His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
is neglected, his soul is neglected: Or it may be
he is a forward first-Table man, but you shall find
him tardy in the second: He will make <hi>many
prayers,</hi> and <hi>long prayers,</hi> yet make no conscience
of devouring widdows houses: He is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to piety, but mean while neglects judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and mercy: The sincere joyn altogether:
He is so far careful of justice with men, that mean
while he will not neglect the first and great part of
justice, <hi>viz.</hi> to give God his due: He doth justly,
he loves mercy, but withall walks humbly with
God: He walketh <hi>soberly,</hi> with respect to himself;
<hi>righteously</hi> towards his neighbour, and <hi>godly</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Maker: He is not of those that are
good only on their knees, but you shall find him
every where conscientious: you shall have <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
at his table, <hi>chastity</hi> and <hi>modesty</hi> in his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
<hi>grace</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> in his words; <hi>charity</hi> in
his deeds, <hi>faithfulness</hi> in his trust <hi>justice</hi> in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
He doth not only <hi>seem</hi> to be religious, but
bridleth his tongue: He is not only a <hi>good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
but a <hi>good Neighbour,</hi> not only a <hi>good Man,</hi> but
a good <hi>Husband,</hi> a good <hi>Master,</hi> a <hi>dutiful Child,</hi> a
<hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>faithful Servant,</hi> a good <hi>Subject.</hi> In
a word, he makes great conscience of discharging
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64323:7"/>
the duties of his relations among men.] (2.) When
others stick in <hi>externals,</hi> do you look to the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
part of every command, and principally
mind the inwards and vitals of Religion? Do you
not only make conscience of performing duties,
but do you carefully look to the <hi>manner</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of them, and the <hi>ends</hi> for which you do
perform them? Do you not only make conscience
of <hi>open</hi> but of <hi>secret</hi> sins? Do you abound above
all in <hi>secret</hi> duties? Do you keep a watch upon
your hearts, and make conscience, not only of the
gross acts of sin, but even of sinful thoughts, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and desires? And are grieved even with
your very infirmities and the corrupt disposition
of your natures, which you cannot help though you
would?—</p>
               <p>Q. II. <hi>When others have their reserves in closing
with Christ,</hi> do you <hi>give up all to him entirely?</hi> Have
you taken Christ not hand over head, but delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
understandingly, sitting down first, and
counting the cost? Have you not secret reserves
for your own ease, safety, estates, esteem on some
beloved sin? Have you upon solemn considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
accepted Christ as the Lord your righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for better for worse, for all changes of times
and conditions? to run all hazards with him, and
to take your lot with him fall as it will?—</p>
               <p>Q. III. <hi>When others are for a little of religion by
the by, do you make religion your business?</hi> Do you
not put off God with the worlds leavings? and
serve him when you are at leisure? Must not God
stand by while the world is first served? and are
not your souls the least of your cares? and put off
with some by <hi>scraps,</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> of your time? Is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
your Trade, and your <hi>conversation in Heaven?</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64323:7"/>
do you <hi>walk with God?</hi> or have you only now and
then a turn with him? When you have ended
your prayers, is there an end of your religion till
you come to them again? or do you carry on a
design of religion throughout your whole course?
Have you only a list of religion at the outside the
piece? or is the woof of religion woven into the
whole cloth? into heart and life? into your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and trades and tables? do you <hi>first seek the
kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof?</hi> Is it
the chief care of your lives, that God be served,
and your souls be saved? and is this the one thing
necessary with you, that you chiefly mind, and are
most solicitous about? Do your very hearts say
with <hi>David, one thing have I desired of the Lord,
that I will seek after,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
               <p>Q. IV. <hi>When others are for the wages of religion,
are you for the work?</hi> Can you say with <hi>David, I
have chosen thy precepts?</hi> do your hearts come off
freely in this choice? Had you rather be <hi>holy,</hi> than
otherwise, if you were at your choice? had you
rather be Gods servants and live at his command,
then at your own lusts? Do you count the Laws
of Christ your heritage, or rather do you not
count them your bondage? Do you choose not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>wages</hi> of righteousness, but the <hi>wayes</hi> of
righteousness? Are Gods Commandments your
<hi>delight?</hi> and are the <hi>sweetest hours</hi> of your lives,
the hours you spend with him? Do you never
injoy your selves so much as when you most injoy
God? Is his service the greatest comfort, and is it
meat and drink to you to do his will, (unless when
you are not your selves in the time of temptation
or desertion.) Do you make use of holy duties
only as men do of Physick, when they are ill at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64323:8"/>
ease, when conscience lasheth or affliction stings,
as it were, to conjure down the frightful furies?
or to pacifie God, that he may not hurt you? or
else do you use them as your daily bread, the
very staff of your life, and means of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts?</p>
               <p>Q. V. <hi>When others are for the cheap and easie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are you for self-denial?</hi> When others are
for the religion that will serve <hi>them best,</hi> are you
for that which will serve <hi>God best?</hi> When others
are all upon the sparing hand, and will spare what
may be spared, and study how they may best save
charges in going to heaven, are you of Princely
spirits, to resolve not to serve the Lord with that
which will cost you nothing? Is your course of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
such as doth put your flesh to it, and cross
and curb its desires? Or do you love to give it
what it craves, and suffer it to take its own way?
Have you no enemy you dread so much as self?
Do you pamper and please it and make provision
for it? or do you pray and watch against it, and
grieve for its unhappy infirmities in your actions?
and had rather then all the world that this enemy
were under your feet:—</p>
               <p>Q. VI. <hi>When others are for no more of religion
then needs must, are you for the height of religion?</hi>
The hypocrite (as one well) is very inquisitive
what is the lowest pitch that a man may have, and
go to heaven; and upon this design, if he could
find but this, he would look no further: but the
sincere Christian though satisfied that his state is
safe, will rest in no attainments in grace; but
reaches forward and presses on, if it were possible to
attain to the resurrection of the dead. He that doth
not <hi>desire and design and endeavour perfection, never
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64323:8"/>
yet came up to sincerity.</hi> A true believer desires <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
for holiness</hi> sake, and therefore is set upon
<hi>perfecting holiness;</hi> Others desire
it only for heavens sake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are only for so much as will
bear their charges thither; others
make use of holiness only as a
bridge to Heaven, and therefore are
for no more then will just serve
their turn<note n="*" place="margin">And they have a false notion of Heaven it self: else they might justly desire it as the end of their present ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, it being the fruition of God in perfect holiness.</note>. The true believer hath
a <hi>holy nature,</hi> and therefore holiness
is his element and natural employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and he must needs desire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in its height, because every nature reaches
after perfection in its kind: The godly desires not
holiness only because it is the way to Heaven,
but he loves Heaven the better for the holy
way that leads to it, and for the perfect holiness
which is there.</p>
               <p>Q. VII. <hi>When others are all for the Salvation of
Christ, are you as truly for Sanctification by Christ?</hi>
Do you take Christ as God offers him with all his
offices, and benefits, to be both a Prince and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
to give you repentance as well as remission
of sins? Are you willing of the <hi>dominion</hi> of Christ,
as well as <hi>deliverance by Christ?</hi> Do you close with
his burden, as well as his benefits? do you count
his laws your liberty? his government, not your
bondage but your priviledge? his service your
freedom? Do you go in Christs ways, as in jives
or fetters? or do you run with inlargement of
heart, delight or real willingness?</p>
               <p>Q. VIII. <hi>When others do make self their end, do
you set up God above all as your highest end?</hi> The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
doth the <hi>same duties</hi> with the godly, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64323:9"/>
with different ends: He eats for himself and fasts
for himself, and prays with no better then self ends,
and therefore is rejected. Now is it your great
design in your whole course to glorifie God and
enjoy God? Do you count this your whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and blessedness? do you make other business
to stoop to this? other interest to yield to this?
Do your souls breath after this above all worldly
good, that Christ may be magnified in you? Do
you count your <hi>name</hi> and your <hi>estate</hi> as <hi>loss,</hi> and the
delights of sense but <hi>puddle-water</hi> in comparison
of Christ? If conscience give in a comfortable and
clear answer to these Questions, Go in peace, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are you of the Lord: God is your Friend.
Heaven is your Heritage: The Promises are your
Portion: Christ is yours, all is yours; For he
that doth these things shall never be moved,

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHat may, and must a Christian be, and
do, that he may please God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To your pleasing of God something is necessary
as to your persons or estates, and something as to your
performances and acts?</p>
               <p>First, As to your <hi>persons</hi> or <hi>estates,</hi> it is necessary
in general that you be in a <hi>state of reconciliation
with God:</hi> If you would walk worthy of the Lord
unto <hi>all pleasing,</hi> you must first be <hi>friends with him:</hi>
for <hi>how can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi>
Get the controversie taken up between God and
thee, and then shalt thou with <hi>Levi, walk with God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64323:9"/>
in peace.</hi> Labour to get the breaches made up,
to have the enmity slain, to have divine displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
removed: till thy pardon be obtained, and
thy peace made, nothing thou canst do will please
God: he will be angry with thy person, and angry
with thy prayers: What a tart Message is that to
impenitent sinners, <hi>Malach.</hi> 1. 10. God cannot take
pleasure in their persons: <hi>I have no pleasure in you,
saith the Lord of Hosts</hi>] nor in any of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances;
<hi>neither will I accept an offering at your
hand.</hi>] He professeth that his soul had no delight
in them, and tells them they are unto him <hi>as a
Vessel wherein there is no pleasure,</hi> Gen. 22. 28. It's
the modest expression of that Vessel into which
Nature empties it self. Come in then, and touch
the golden Scepter; yield to mercy; kiss the Son;
resign to Christ: accept of the peace tendred you
in the Word of Reconciliation, and then God
will be friends. More particularly, that you may
be in a state of reconciliation, and so in a capacity
of pleasing God, you must follow these directions.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Put off every sin:</hi> It is your iniquity that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth
between you and your God: this is the
make-bate. If thou wouldst have God pleased,
turn every sin out of doors, pluck it out, cast it
from thee: <hi>If thou regard iniquity in thy heart, God
will not hear thee, nor regard thee,</hi> Psal. 66. 8. If thou
art of them that have <hi>pleasure in unrighteousness,</hi> the
Lord hath no <hi>pleasure in thee.</hi> He is not a God that
hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not dwell
with him: the foolish shall not stand in his sight:
he hateth all the workers of iniquity. See that
thou abandon every sin that thou knowest; spare
not one <hi>Agag;</hi> not a right eye, not an <hi>Herodias;</hi>
for then God will not spare thee: Give the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64323:10"/>
of thy bosom a Bill of divorce: say to all thy
Idols, <hi>get thee hence.</hi> God will not <hi>look to that
man</hi> that looks pleasantly upon any sin: The Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
God will not endure to see thee hankering on
the Harlots lips; embracing any sin with delight:
He will not bear it, to see thee smile upon any
sin: He holds thee for a Traytor to his Crown,
if thou willingly harbour his Enemy: Though
thou be very diligent in Gods Service, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentest
him with multitude of Sacrifices, and many
Prayers, he will be pleased with nothing, but hide
his Face, and stop his Ears, whilst thou keepest
thine iniquities in thine hands, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. God
will not amicably treat with them that will not
put away the evil of their doings. O look into thy
hands! look into thy heart! look into thy house! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy shop! thy trade! thy calling! see if there be
not some <hi>way of wickedness,</hi> that thou art found in.
Thou canst not have peace with God, nor he
pleasure in thee till this be removed; put off
therefore the old Man with his deeds.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Put on the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 13.]</p>
               <p>First, <hi>The red Robe of his Righteousness for Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi>
The Lord will never give thee a good look,
nor a good word but in Christ: He is a revenging,
a consuming fire out of Christ: but get on his robes,
&amp; he will be well pleased. <hi>Enoch</hi> had this testimony
that he pleased God: but Christ had much more
that God was well-pleased with sinners, in
and for him. Away with these rags, and with
these fig-leaves. How can the righteous soul of
God but abhor you, whilst in the menstruous
cloaths of your own righteousness? Dare not to
come to God but with Christ in your Arms? Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him not but in the garments of your elder
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64323:10"/>
Brother, lest you carry away the curse. <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s
filthy garments must be put off, and Christs Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
put on: or else there is no standing before
the bright and burning eyes of infinite holiness.
Put on the Lord Jesus in believing; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of him in all his Offices, with all his inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
and deliver up thy self to him; and this
will intitle thee to his merits, and righteousness:
Without this nothing will avail. If thy head
were waters, and thine eyes a fountain of tears, if
thou shouldst wear thy tongue to the roots with
praying, if thou shouldst weep an Ocean, and
wash thy self in thine own brine; all could not
get out one spot: nothing can be accepted while
thou art out of Christ; and therefore in the first
place apply thy self to him. God will accept of
no Gift but off his Altar.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The white Robe of his grace of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
Rev. 5. 11. Thou that art in the <hi>flesh,</hi>
that is, unrenewed, unsanctified, <hi>canst not please</hi> God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. Never think to make up the matter by
a little <hi>mending</hi> and <hi>reforming</hi> particular Acts:
Man thy <hi>heart</hi> must be <hi>renewed;</hi> thy state must be
<hi>clean altered;</hi> or God cannot be pleased, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.
16, 17, 18. The Tree must be made <hi>good;</hi> the
Fountain must be healed, or else the Stream will
be salt and the Fruit sowr. If Christ be once
formed in thee, that is, his image in his grace:
Likeness is the ground of Love: Similitude and
suitableness of nature, is the loadstone of Affection.
God cannot but love his own likeness, wouldst
thou have his Favour? wouldst thou be his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light?
then conform to his pleasure, study to be
like him, purifie thy self as he is pure. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Lord loveth righteousness: he desireth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64323:11"/>
truth in the inward parts, and takes infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in the graces of his people. These are the
Spikenard and the Saffron, the Spices, the Beds of
Lillies; the sweet Ointments that Christ is so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with: These are the Cinamon and the
Trees of Frankincense, the Calamus and the
Camphire; the Myrrhe and the Aloes: the Chains
of the neck, and the precious Pearls that he is so
ravished withall, and doth so superlatively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. This is the Rayment of Needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
and Gold of Ophir, wherein the Queen is
presented to her Royal Husband, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 9, 13.
Therefore as the Elect of God holy and beloved,
<hi>Col.</hi> 5. 12, 13. Put ye on <hi>bowels of mercy, kindness:</hi>
put off all <hi>these, anger, wrath, malice, filthy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and put on the new Man,</hi> Col. 3. 9, 10. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
let me commend to you some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
graces which God doth manifest himself to be
wonderfully pleased withall. As ever you would
please God get on these:</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Be cloathed with Humility,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. This
is a Garment which must be put on, or else you
cannot be accepted or saved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3. Here is
the dress that you must come to God in. He must
be <hi>served in humility of mind, Acts</hi> 20. 14. You
must humble your selves to walk with him, <hi>Mich.</hi>
6. 8. Humility is a plain, but yet a comely gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This grace doth eminently honour God;
and therefore God doth put a peculiar honour
upon, and manifest a most special delight in this.
Of all the men in the world this is the man that
God will lock unto; even he that is poor and of
a contrite spirit that trembleth at his Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.
2. Though he be the high and lofty One, who
inhabiteth Eternity, whose Name is Holy, (from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64323:11"/>
whence the trembling soul is ready to conclude,
that surely such a fearful Majesty, cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
him; such sin hating purity cannot but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
him; yet he will lay (<hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 15.) aside
his Majesty and bear with mans impurity, and
condescend to most familiar and constant commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and cohabitation with his poor dust, when
contrite at his feet, and prostrate in humility. If
thou wouldst be accepted of God, come as <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dads</hi>
servants to the King of <hi>Israel</hi> with a rope
about thy neck, and ashes on thy head, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.
32. think meanly of thy self, and God will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. Put thy self in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
room, and God will set thee higher. Be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in thine own eyes, and thou shalt be high in
his. A proud heart and a proud look is with God
the first-born of abomination. As ever thou
wouldst have God well-pleased with thee, be
throughly displeased with thy self: If thou dost
throughly loath thy self, God doth love thee: If
thou abhorrest thy self, God delighteth in thee.
Be angry with thy self, and the Almighty will
turn away his anger from thee: Condemn thy self
and God will acquit thee. In no wise extenuate
thy sins, nor justifie thy self. Think the worse of
thy self, and be willing that others should think
meanly of thee, and heartily love them that slight
thee. This is the frame in which God is well-pleased:
pass sentence on thy self, and God will
absolve thee: Set thy self at his foot-stool, and
he will lift thee up into the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Labour for sincerity:</hi> This is not a distinct grace
from the rest; yet for Doctrines sake I speak to it
distinctly. <hi>Vprightness</hi> is the great thing that
God looks after, and covenants for, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64323:12"/>
It renders all our persons and performances ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
before God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. Such as are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in the way are Gods delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 20.
To these are all the promises of peace, Salvation,
Pardon, preservation, Blessedness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 87. 10. In
a word, there is <hi>no good thing</hi> God will <hi>with-hold
from them that walk uprightly, Prov.</hi> 28. 10. This was
<hi>Noah</hi>'s praise that <hi>he was upright in his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
This was that set off <hi>Iob</hi> at such a rate that
God doth so extol him for, and as it were make
his boast of him, the singular sincerity and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of his heart. Study to be upright: See that
the main bent of your hearts be to please God, and
honour him: That Gods interest be uppermost
with you: That he hath the chief share in you,
and the eye of the soul be principally to him; for
in this sincerity doth consist, as to your main
state. Let your great care be of your hearts:
Here is a Christians great work. The Lord seeth
not as man seeth; for man looketh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, but the Lord looketh to the
heart: see therefore that thou look to it: Let thine
eye be chiefly there where Gods eye is: He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not so much what thou dost as with what a
heart: Go then and do likewise: yet be not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in this that you are upright as to your
states, but labour to approve your selves in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness
to God in your particular actions: Do
common as well as spiritual actions with holy
ends: Much of our lives are lost for want of this:
So much as is done for God, of his strange grace
he accounts himself our debtour. But what <hi>is
done</hi> for no higher end then <hi>self,</hi> is lost from our
account.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Put on a spirit of zeal and activity.</hi> How
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64323:12"/>
wonderfully is God pleased with <hi>Phineas</hi> zeal,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 11, 12, 13. What a great approbation
doth he manifest of him? What an attestation
doth he give to him? he is so greatly pleased with
his zealous appearance for him, that he turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his displeasure from the whole congregation
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and overlooks their crimson provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against him. On the contrary, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that God is more displeased with then the
remisness, and lifelessness, and indifferency in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
The luke-warm water is not a greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the stomach, then the luke-warm Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
is to God; and therefore he will spue such a
one out of his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. Christians, where
is your zeal for the Lord of Hosts? Christs redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
must be zealous of good works: <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.
not slothful in business but fervent in spirit serving
the Lord, <hi>Acts 18. 25. Rom. 12. 11. Acts</hi> 26. 6, 7.
instantly night and day for the hope of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
do not only that which is right in the sight
of the Lord, but do it with all your heart:
The Lord loveth a willing servant: Bestir your
selves for the Lord. Be ye followers of Christ
who went up and down doing good. Every
Christian should be a common blessing. A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
good. This is to be the children of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven, who is good unto all,
and his tender mercies are over all his works: And
be sure the Father doth best love that child that is
most like him: A private narrow spirit is a low
and a base spirit; unworthy of a Christian.
A Catholick communicative spirit, full of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and great designes. A large heart, set upon
doing good, whose fire though ever hottest within,
will be breaking forth of his breast and provoking
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64323:13"/>
others: whose love will not be <hi>confined to a party;</hi>
but gladly and thankfully owneth Christ where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he sees him. This <hi>Catholick spirit,</hi> I say, is
the <hi>glory of Religion;</hi> the <hi>Churches blessing,</hi> and
<hi>Gods delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Live by faith,</hi> Heb. 10. 38. This is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
grace in Gods account, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 1. 1 Pet.</hi> 1.
7. It giveth glory to God; and therefore God
taketh no small pleasure in it. By faith <hi>Enoch</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that testimony that he <hi>pleased</hi> God, <hi>Rom. 4.
20. Heb. 11. 5. 2 Cor. 4. 18. Heb. 11. 39. Matth.</hi>
8. 10. If you would so walk as to please
God, you must walk by faith. Christians
must look to the things unseen; they must not
live at the common rate: Christ must be their
life and breath, their prayers and their promises,
their dayly bread. By faith did the Elders ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that good report: 'twas Faith that Christ
was so greatly taken with in the Centurion, which
made him to commend him for a none-such.
This was that which won such a singular praise
and approbation from our Saviour to the woman
of <hi>Canaan;</hi> even her victorious faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.
28. Thou hast taken away my heart, my Sister,
my Spouse, thou hast taken away my heart with
one of thine eyes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. that is, with thy
<hi>faith.</hi> Live in the power of faith, and thou wilt
please him to the heart: Give glory to him by
believing. Let the life thou now livest in the
flesh be by faith of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Live by faith in <hi>prosperity,</hi> though thou hast
the world about thee, let it not be above
thee: Keep it at thy feet; use it as thy servant:
Be much in the views of glory, and contemplation
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64323:13"/>
of Eternity: Buy as though thou possest not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
as though thou rejoycedst not, love as though
thou lovedst not, use this world as not abusing it,
it is but a <hi>fashion</hi> not a <hi>substance,</hi> and that which
it is passeth away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30, 31. Use it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with mortified affections, and prove the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of your faith by the victory over your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
content and delight in, and desires after,
and cares for the things of this world, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi>
5. 4.</p>
               <p>Live <hi>by faith in adversity:</hi> Weep as though
you wept not; enduring the cross and despising
the shame, as looking unto Jesus, <hi>Heb. 12. 2. Heb.</hi>
11. 26. accounting Christs reproaches your riches,
his shame your glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. Compare these
light afflictions with the weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor. 4.
17. Rom.</hi> 8. 18. Ply your hearts with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
Count if you can the riches that are laid
up in them. Roll your selves upon the Lord,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 5. and know that your heavenly Father
hath no greater delight, then to see his Children
trust him with confidence, when all visible helps
are out of sight, and he seems to be their enemy,
<hi>Iob</hi> 13. 15.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Put on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,</hi>
this is in the <hi>sight of God of great price. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 4.
Study to be like your Father, slow to anger,
ready to forgive, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 1. 8. forgetting inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
loving enemies, requiting ill-will with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
ill words with courtesies, neglects with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
and if any wrong you, do him a kindness
the sooner: so shall you bear his likeness and be
his delight. And know ye that are of unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
passions and unbridled tongues God hath an
especial hatred and displeasure against, a <hi>froward
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64323:14"/>
heart</hi> and a <hi>froward tongue, Prov.</hi> 3. 32. 11, 20. 1. 12.
8. 12. Oh seek meekness: How can the holy
Dove rest in a wrathful heart. Christ is a Lamb
of meekness: how can he take pleasure in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
contentious spirit: Verily with the froward
he will shew himself froward, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 26. If
you will not forgive others he will not forgive
you. Art thou hard to be pleased, a froward wife,
a froward master, a cross and willful servant?
surely God will not be pleased with thee: he will
mete to you as you measure to others, <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. 24.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>Get a spirit of self-denyal.</hi> God is then
pleased best when self is displeased most: When
we can be content to be emptied, content to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based,
that God may be honoured; and with the
Holy Baptist, are wiling to be eclipsed by Christ;
willing to decrease that he may increase: counting
our selves no losers whilst his interest is a gainer:
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 29, 30. rejoycing that we are made low
for Christs advancement: This is well-pleasing
unto God: How greatly was he pleased with
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s self-denying choice, and gives him his
asking, throwing in riches, and honours into the
bargain? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12. Strange was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
self-denyal. What! to sacrifice with his
own hand, the whole hope of his Family! the
Heir of Promise! the Child of his Years! a Son!
an only Son! when his life was bound up in the
lads life! Was ever mortal thus put to it? But
<hi>Abraham</hi> shall not be a loser. God gives him a
testimony from Heaven: blesses him, blesses his
Seed: blesses all Nations in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 15, 16,
17, 18. Wonderful was <hi>Moses his self-denyal;</hi>
but more wonderful was his acceptation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64323:14"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24. none like <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 34. 10.
God preferred him in another manner then <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
could. He must speak with him face to face
as a man with his friend: His word shall be as it
were a Law with God: Speak for whom he will,
they shal be spared though they seemed to be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to destruction. But speak against him who durst,
he shall be sure to bear his iniquity, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 8.
Forget self: Renounce thine own wisdom; thine
own worthiness; thine own will; Bite in thy
passions: Curb thine appetite: Bridle thy tongue:
This do and thou shalt be greatly accepted: and
shalt find that Gods favour will infinitely reward
thee, for all the murmuring oppositions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of thy flesh, which will be ready to be
impatient to have the reins held so hard.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>Maintain a spirit of resolution and constancy
in the ways of God,</hi> Heb. 10. 38. This was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
of the three Worthies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. They feared
not the fierceness of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> rage, nor the
fire of the furnace: all the world could not make
them bow: and how gloriously did God own
them, and miraculously evidence his pleasure in
them: Stand your ground: Resolve to live and
die by substantial godliness: cleave to the Lord
with full purpose of heart: Let no difficulties
make you change your station, then shall you
be an honour and a pleasure to the God that
made you.</p>
               <p>Well then, would you know what frame of
heart is pleasing to God? why this <hi>humble, sincere,
zealous, active, frame,</hi> this <hi>believing, meek, self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
resolved</hi> frame; this is the frame that is well
pleasing in the sight of God?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As to your performances,</hi> more briefly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64323:15"/>
that those may please God, you must heedfully
look to these five things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That they be done by the right Rule;</hi> which is
<hi>Gods Word;</hi> You must not follow the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of your own hearts, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 39. you must
not do that which is right in your own eyes: In
all sacred actions you must have Gods command
to warrant you: you may not offer to God of
that, of which you are not able to say, <hi>Thou requirest
these things at our hands, Isa.</hi> 1. 12. In all civil
actions you must have Gods allowance: Be sure
he will never accept that which his Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns;
under pains of Gods displeasure, dare not
to set your hands to what the <hi>Word forbids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>That they be done to the right end,</hi> which is
Gods glory: How damnably did the Pharisees
erre! How miserably did <hi>Iehu</hi> miscarry! and
both in acts for the <hi>matter commanded,</hi> for want
of aiming at this end.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That they proceed from right Principles.</hi> (1.)
<hi>Faith,</hi> without which it is impossible to please
God: Prayer will not avail except it be the prayer
of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. We beleeve, and therefore
we speak. (2.) <hi>Love:</hi> If we should give our
goods to the poor, and bodies to the fire, and not
from Love, it would profit us nothing. Where
the slavish fear of hell only, or of the lashes of
conscience, or the love of mans praise, carries men
to duties, or where any other carnal principle is
<hi>predominant</hi> in the act, it cannot please God. (3.)
<hi>Fear:</hi> we cannot serve God <hi>acceptably,</hi> without
<hi>reverence and godly</hi> fear (not <hi>slavish</hi> fear.) The
Lord <hi>taketh pleasure in them that fear him,</hi> in them
that hope in his <hi>mercy.</hi> Observe the happy mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where these two are conjoyned; that is, a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64323:15"/>
true filial fear and faith. Saith <hi>David I will come into
thy House in the multitude of thy mercy</hi> (Behold his
<hi>faith) and in thy fear will I worship towards thy
holy Temple</hi> (there is his <hi>fear</hi> with faith) <hi>Faith
without fear</hi> were bold presumption: Fear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith is sinful despair: joyn them together and
God is well-pleased.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>That they be done in a right manner: Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,</hi>
not <hi>rashly</hi> and inconsiderately in the presence
of so dreadful a Majesty: <hi>prudently,</hi> for lawful acts
may be spoiled, and be done unlawfully without
consideration had to the offence that may (in some
cases attend them): yea holy Duties as well as
common Actions may be turned into sins, by
being ill-timed, and for want of a due <hi>attending</hi>
the present circumstances: <hi>Holily,</hi> not rashly, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
any thing with our mouths before God;
but behaving our selves as in his sight: Heartily,
not feignedly: with our lips going, when our
minds are gadding.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>That they be directed through the right means,
that is, Iesus Christ the only way to the Father:</hi>
Bring all thy Sacrifices to the High Priest, offer all
upon this Altar, else all is lost: not that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to say (<hi>Through our Lord Iesus Christ,
Amen)</hi> at the end; but in every duty you must
come with lively dependance on him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and strength, for assistance and acceptance.
Remember to do <hi>all in the name of the Lord Iesus:</hi>
to come leaning upon his hand, without this all
your services will be rejected at last.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> In regard there is none that doth good and
finneth not, and God is not, nor can be pleased
with sin, no not in his own people, but most of
all hates it in them, it cannot be that any man in
this life should <hi>fully</hi> come up to Christs Example
in this: yet may we come so far on towards it, as
that not only in our immediate addresses to God,
but in the general course of our lives, we may
come to <hi>please God.</hi> Thus <hi>Enoch and Noah walked
with God: i. e.</hi> in their general course they walked

be followers of Christ in this, to do always those
things that <hi>please God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In order to this there is something necessary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64323:16"/>
with reference 1. To our Persons: 2. To our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
3. To our Practices, with reference to our
Persons: <hi>and here it is necessary 1. That there
be an alteration of</hi> our natures <hi>by</hi> renewing grace:
<hi>for</hi> they that are in the flesh cannot please God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8.</p>
            <p>These <hi>wild Vines</hi> must needs bring forth <hi>sowre
grapes, Isa.</hi> 5. 4. The fruit that they bear (how

<hi>bring forth good things,</hi> Matth. 12. 36.</p>
            <p>Many enlightned sinners think by reading, and
praying; forsaking some conscience-wasting sins,
to pacifie God, and set all right: Mistaken souls,
let me undeceive you: you begin at the wrong
end, your first and greatest care must be, to get
<hi>your hearts and natures changed and renewed by the
power of converting grace:</hi> you labour in vain at the
streams, while the fountain of corruption in the
heart remains in its strength. You must not
think it is with you as it is with a ruinous house,
where the mending of here and there a little will
make up all again; no, but the old building must
be quite book down, and the foundation stone laid
anew, in a <hi>sound repentance from dead works,</hi> and
<hi>through conversion unto God.</hi> Till this be done you
must know that God hath <hi>no pleasure in you,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will accept an offering at your hand, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.
10. as he doth from those that are his friends.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That there be the Acceptation of your persons
through faith in Christ Iesus:</hi> For in him alone it
is that God will be well-pleased, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. last, so
that <hi>without faith,</hi> interessing us in him, <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to please God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64323:17"/>For the better understanding both these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
know that there are two Attributes of
God to which you must bear a conformity, or else
you cannot please him.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The holiness of God:</hi> for he is not a God that
hath pleasure in iniquity; He heareth not sinners:
The foolish shall not stand in his sight; He hateth
all the workers of iniquity, <hi>Psal. 5. 4, 5. Iohn</hi> 9.
31. God can no more take pleasure in the unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
then we in swine or serpents.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Iustice of God:</hi> for he will by no means
clear the guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. Could we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
holiness in us in our unpardoned state, yet
<hi>justice</hi> could not but be infinitely offended while
guilt lyeth unremoved: as you may see in Christ.
For though he were <hi>perfectly holy,</hi> yet being under
the guilt of our sins imputed to him, the severity
of Gods justice broke out against him.</p>
            <p>Now man being naturally an offence both to
the <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> of God, there must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
pass upon him in order to his <hi>pleasing God,</hi>
this two-fold change.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>real change of Sanctification:</hi> I call this
a real change, because by this there is a real change
infusing of new qualities and dispositions, making
him of proud humble, of carnal spiritual, and
heavenly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>relative change of Iustification:</hi> I call
this a <hi>relative</hi> change, because this is not a change
<hi>in a mans nature,</hi> but in his <hi>condition,</hi> making him
to stand in a new relation to the <hi>Law,</hi> with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to which he was before guilty and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
but now the Law pronounces the same man
clear and acquitted; and this is not for any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<hi>infused</hi> into him, but for the <hi>satisfaction</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64323:17"/>
and <hi>payment</hi> of another laid down for him: satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
there must be, and a righteousness must
be tendered, or else God cannot be at peace. We
have <hi>nothing to pay, Luke</hi> 7. 42. Oh sinner! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to Christ for it, Hide thee in the Clifts of
that Rock; Run to the Fountain opened for sin
and for uncleanness. Appear not before God but
in the Robes of Christs Righteousness. He sends
you to Jesus, as he did them to <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 42.
the last. <hi>Go to my servant</hi> Job, <hi>he shall pray for you,
him will I accept:</hi> Get out of your selves: fly to
Christ, labour to be found in him; else all your
endeavours in wrinsing and washing your selves
will be to no effect.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>With reference to our Principles.</hi> And here
it is necessary that some <hi>corrupt principles</hi> be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnt,</hi>
and some <hi>holy principles.</hi> be <hi>received</hi> and
retained.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>corrupt Principles</hi> must be <hi>unlearnt.</hi> As
1. That <hi>it is enough if we serve God on the Lords day,
and we may serve our selves all the rest of the week.</hi>
Though God hath reserved one day in seven
wholly for his immediate service, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in a peculiar sense called the Lords day, yet
we must know that <hi>every day</hi> is his, and that
he hath not allowed us one hour nor inch of
time, but only for his service. Indeed he hath
service of <hi>more sorts then one:</hi> but we must know
that the business of our ordinary affairs, if rightly
done, is a <hi>serving of the Lord Christ,</hi> Col. 3. 24.
God is as truly served by you in the <hi>working</hi> days
labour, as the <hi>Sabbath days rest,</hi> if you do it in a
right manner and to holy ends.</p>
            <p>There are a generation whose Religion is but
a <hi>Sundays Religion,</hi> which they put on and off
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64323:18"/>
with their Sundays Cloaths; and then they think
God is fairly served for the week: although God
knows, that little they do then, is but poorly done
neither. Never think God will accept it at thy
hands when thou livest six days to the world and
thy self, for <hi>one</hi> that thou spendest for him. This
shews thee to be under the unmortified power of
self-love and not to be the Lords: for none of
<hi>his,</hi> liveth to <hi>himself, Rom.</hi> 14. 7. You must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that you are but to <hi>learn,</hi> upon the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
how to serve God all the <hi>week,</hi> and not
think when the Lords day is ended his work is
done.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That if God be served morning and evening it
is enough,</hi> though we serve our selves the rest of
the day: God must be served <hi>every day</hi> and <hi>all the
day Prov.</hi> 23. 17. You must be serving him not
only in your <hi>Fasts,</hi> but at your <hi>Meals;</hi> not
onely on your <hi>Knees,</hi> but in your <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some think that if they keep up <hi>religious duties</hi>
they may do what they list at other times: that if
they be <hi>intermperate, lascivious, unrighteous,</hi> it is but
to make even again with God at night, and all will
be well. Like the whore in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that having
made her offering was presently ready for new
wickedness, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 14. as if she had paid off the
old score, and might now boldly run upon a new.
These are not the Children of God, but of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others think that though they may not serve
the <hi>Devil</hi> at any time, yet giving God his dues
<hi>morning and evening</hi> they may <hi>serve themselves</hi> the
rest of the time. But in vain do they lay claim to
God, who live more to themselves then they do
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64323:18"/>
to him. This will be found horrible sacriledge to
put off God but with the tenth. God is to be
eyed, and served in all that you do; and this is
that I drive at, that we may not <hi>divide our selves</hi>
between God and the world; between his service
and our own ends, and so put off him with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
service, but that we may do all in obedience
to him, and we may be <hi>intirely</hi> the Lords. That
he <hi>in all things may be glorified by us,</hi> and we
may not <hi>lose our Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Some holy Principles must be received and
retained. As</p>
            <p>Pr. 1. <hi>That the pleasing of God is our only Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and our highest Blessedness.</hi> First our <hi>only Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness:</hi>
what is it that we call or count our <hi>Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi>
1. That is a mans <hi>Business</hi> which his <hi>liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
and <hi>subsistence</hi> depends upon. The <hi>Lawyer</hi>
counts the <hi>Law</hi> his <hi>Business:</hi> And the <hi>Tradesman</hi>
counts his Trade his <hi>Business;</hi> because upon this
their <hi>livelihood</hi> and <hi>subsistence</hi> depends. Brethren,
our <hi>whole</hi> depends upon the <hi>pleasing of God:</hi> Do
this and do all: miss in this, and you marr all:
please him and you are made for ever: if he be
not pleased you are undone for ever. How careful
is the <hi>selfish</hi> Courtier to please his Prince? how
will he crouch and flatter? and if he can but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
what will gratifie and please him, he thinks
himself happy: And why? but because all his
<hi>dependance</hi> is upon his Princes favour: Much
more do we depend upon the favour of God.
Blessed is the man <hi>whom he chooseth,</hi> Psal. 65. 4. <hi>In
his favour is life,</hi> Psal. 30. 5. But wo to them
that have God against them: these are perfectly
miserable: <hi>Reprobate silver shall men call them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6. 30. If the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64323:19"/>
Lord do but say to a man as he did to <hi>Moses, Thou
hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name,</hi>
Happy is that man. But if he thus say, <hi>I have no
pleasure in thee,</hi> you may cover the face of that
man, as they did <hi>Hamans,</hi> and carry him away:
miserable must his end be if he so continue.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That is a mans Business which he hath his Stock
and Talents for:</hi> If a Man be entrusted as a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
or a Factour, his <hi>Business</hi> is to buy in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
that are useful. Beloved, all our Time,
Parts, Interests, Food, Rayment, and whatever
Mercies spiritual or temporal, are the Stock
wherewith God hath entrusted us, and all for his
own use and service. And is it not a sad and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
case, that God should have so great a Stock
going, as lies in the hands of all the Sons of Men,
and yet have, (if I may so so speak) so little profit
of it? I mean so little glory by it: That he should
sow so much and reap so little; strew so much
and gather so little? Is it not sad that men should
have so much in vain? Hast thou health or wealth,
and dost not use in for God, it is all in vain.
Hast thou understanding, and yet improvest it but
for contriving thine own affairs, and worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
thy reason and understanding are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
in vain. Oh how wilt thou answer it,
that thou hast had so great a stock in thine hands,
and made so little improvement of it? It had been
good for some men if they had never had a foot of
Land, or an hours ease, if they had never had the
understanding of men, because they have not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their Talents for God, and for the ends for
which they were put into their hands.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That is a mans Business which his capacities
do call for:</hi> It is a mans <hi>Business</hi> if in the capacity
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64323:19"/>
of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> to do justice; or of a Servant to do his
Masters will. Brethren, all your <hi>capacities</hi> do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
it to be your <hi>business to please God:</hi> you
are his <hi>Friends,</hi> you are his <hi>Servants,</hi> therefore
must <hi>please him well in all things,</hi> Titus 2. 9. His
<hi>children,</hi> And therefore must set your selves to
<hi>honour him, Malach.</hi> 1. 6. his <hi>Spouse,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is your <hi>business to please your Husband,</hi> 1 Cor.
7. 34.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That is a mans Business which he hath his
maintenance for:</hi> If a man be maintained in the place
of a Schoolmaster, it is his Business to teach: if of
a <hi>Souldier,</hi> it is his Business to fight. Beloved, do
you not know at whose <hi>finding</hi> you are? And do
you think God keeps so many servants to be idle,
or to mind their own designs and pleasures? God
hath cut you out every one his work: every man
his hands full: So much work is to be done <hi>within
door,</hi> and so much <hi>without door;</hi> so much <hi>towards
God, towards your Neighbour, towards your own
selves:</hi> that you have no time to be idle in. And
you shall dearly reckon for it, if you will eat his
Bread and will not do his work: And as pleasing
God is our chiefest Business,</p>
            <p>Secondly, So it is also our <hi>highest Blessedness:</hi>
For mans <hi>happiness</hi> lies in <hi>Gods favour, Psal.</hi> 4. 6.
Our happiness is in attaining the <hi>end of our being;</hi>
and therefore the great quaery amongst the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
still was, <hi>What was the end; or the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of man.</hi> Now the <hi>true end</hi> of our Being is,
that we may <hi>please God: for his pleasure we are and
were created,</hi> Rev. 4. 11. And for this end also
we were <hi>new created</hi> that we should yield our
selves unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13. and being <hi>built up
a spiritual house, should offer up to him spiritual sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,

acceptable through, Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. This
is the end of our <hi>Redemption</hi> that we should serve
not <hi>our selves but him,</hi> in <hi>holiness and righteousness all
the days of our lives,</hi> Luke 1. 75. And <hi>that we
should not henceforth live to our selves but to him that
died for us,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 15. 'Tis the end likewise
of our <hi>Iustification,</hi> that our <hi>consciences</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purged we should <hi>acceptably</hi> serve the living
God. In a word, 'tis the end of our <hi>Glorification,</hi>
that being translated into <hi>Heaven</hi> we should <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
please</hi> God, and serve him <hi>night and day is his
Temple,</hi> Rev. 7. 15. and 22. 3. So that the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of God</hi> is the <hi>whole end</hi> or <hi>whole happiness of
Man,</hi> Eccles. 12. 13. And this will be clear, because
<hi>We do then promote our selves most when we please
God best:</hi> For by this you shall have this two-fold
advantage.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>You shall be the favourites of God.</hi> O glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
promotion! <hi>Haman</hi> thought himself no
little man when he was <hi>Abasuerus</hi> his right hand;
and yet he was at length but preferred to the
Gallows, <hi>Esther</hi> 5. 11. and 7. 10. But what shall
be done to the man whom God delights to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
Oh blessed is that man! wo to him that
toucheth him: <hi>It had been better for him that a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
had been hanged about his neck, and he drowned
in the midst of the sea</hi> then that he should offend
such a one, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 2. God is infinitely chary
of his <hi>favourites.</hi> The apple of his eye is touched
when they are injured, <hi>Zechariah 2. 8. Whosoever
toucheth them shall not be innocent,</hi> Psal. 107. 15.
God hath a blessing for those that shew them a
kindness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. He will render vengeance
upon the ungodly for every <hi>hard speech</hi> they utter
against them, <hi>Iude</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64323:22"/>O man doth not thy soul say, <hi>Happy is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that is in such a case:</hi> will not thy condition
be most Blessed when God shall be thus infinitely
tender of thee, to take all the kindnesses done to
thee as done to himself? <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 45. and all
the injuries done to thee as affronts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4. This is the happy Case of his
Favourites.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Every thing you do shall be found upon
your account with God.</hi> Brethren, are you Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
or are you not? Do you believe the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul, and the Life to come, or do you
not? The ways of the most do declare them to be
real Infidels, though professed Christians. If you
think there be an eternal State to come, will it not
be your highest wisdom to be providing for it,
and laying up what possibly you can, that you
may inherit it in the other world? Will not every
wise man that knows he is shortly to be removed
into another Country be careful to transport all
that he can, that he may enjoy it at his coming?
Beloved, if you do believe indeed that you must
be for ever in another world, will it not be your
best course to be <hi>doing</hi> that, the fruit whereof you
shall enjoy for ever? Were not he a mad man
that having but a very short term upon a Living,
should yet go to building and planting there
when he had Land of Inheritance to build upon?
Infinite is the mischief that comes of <hi>self-seeking</hi>
and <hi>self-pleasing.</hi> You are <hi>eternal</hi> losers by it:
God will say, <hi>you have your reward,</hi> Matth. 6. 5.
Something you may have in hand, but the <hi>eternal
reward</hi> is lost. Brethren, I am ambitious for you,
that what you do, you should do for ever: that
all you do should meet you in the other world, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64323:23"/>
that there you should reap the everlasting fruit of
what you are a doing now. A wise Builder will
build for ever, and not only that which shall last
for a day or for a year. O that you would be
wise Builders! Do all for God, and you shall
have eternal advantage. Learn but this Lesson,
<hi>to set your selves in all things to please God, and you
will be promoting and advancing your selves in all
that ever you do,</hi> always laying up a treasure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
still adding to the heap. And O what riches
will you come to, when by every day, and every
hour, and every action you are gainers? For God
will not let the least thing that is done for him,
no not a cup of cold water go without an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
reward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 42. not your labour be
in vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58.</p>
            <p>Pr. 3. <hi>That when you have done all, if God be
not pleased you have done nothing.</hi> Settle it upon
your hearts, That all is in vain that is not done for
God: when you do not <hi>please God</hi> you do not
profit your selves. When men offer never so
richly, and freely, if not in such a manner as is
<hi>pleasing to God,</hi> all is but a vain oblation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 13.
If men will do more then <hi>ever</hi> God <hi>required,</hi> and
be zealous in things that God hath not <hi>commanded,</hi>
it is but <hi>in vain that they worship him,</hi> Matth. 15. 9.
Beloved, so much time as you have lived to your
selves you have lived in vain; because it was quite
besides your end. O it is a heart-cutting conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to a tender Christian to think of this; that
when his life is so short, and time so little in all,
yet he must be fain to cut off so much! why man,
so many hours must thou cut off from thy dayes,
and so many years from thy life, as thou hast lived
not to God but to thy self; They are all lost as to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64323:23"/>
the ends of life and time. If on repentance
thou be forgiven, thou art not <hi>rewarded</hi> for
them.</p>
            <p>Beloved, You must count that you have lived
no longer then you have <hi>lived unto God,</hi> Phil. 1. 21.
<hi>To me to live is Christ.</hi> I should account I did <hi>not
live,</hi> if I did not live to him: 'Tis the only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of my life to serve him. I should not
tell what to do with my life unless it were to
spend it for him.</p>
            <p>Christian, Thus thou must reckon; so much
time as I have lived to Christ, so much have I
lived; and so much as I have lived to my self, so
much I have lost. 'Tis not the <hi>Man</hi> but the <hi>Beast</hi>
that lives, while we live below our reason, which
distinguishes the <hi>humane life</hi> from that of <hi>Bruits.</hi>
Now while we live not to God, we live utterly
below our <hi>reason it self;</hi> which is sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in that God is the Author and End of
Man. Doth not <hi>reason</hi> dictate that God should
have the glory of his <hi>own work,</hi> and the Vessel
should be to the Potters use? Doth any plant
a Vineyard, or keep a Flock and not expect the
Fruit or the Milk? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. God hath made
thee, O man, <hi>for himself, Prov.</hi> 16. 4. And hast
thou the face of a man and dost not blush at this,
to think that God should make and maintain thee
in vain? If thou hast one grain of ingenuity thou
wilt abhor the thought of this, that thou shouldst <hi>be
in vain.</hi> Why, so much as thou art for thy self
thou art for nothing. It may be thou livest a very
busie life: but if thou actest not for <hi>God</hi> thou art
all this while but busily doing nothing. Thou
mayst sit down in the evening, and say, I have
been all this day doing nothing. Thou wilt find
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64323:24"/>
a blank in Gods Book for that day, nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thine account: on this sad record, such a day
spent and nothing done: God hath his Day-book
and takes notice of all your carriages, how you
rise and how you go forth to your labours, how
you speak, how you eat, and whether you eye
him and his glory in all, or look no higher then
your selves. <hi>Luke 5. 5. We have been toyling all
night and caught nothing.</hi> May not this be the
sad complaint of many a man? I have been toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all my life and yet I have done nothing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
what I did was not done unto the Lord.
How would you take it of your servants, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home in the evening, you should find every
one of them minding their own business, and
pleasure, and your work left undone? Is it not,
sad, sirs, that so many hours and days should pass
over us, and we no nearer our end then ever we
were before? Your little <hi>Children</hi> are busie from
morning to night, and yet all the while have been
doing nothing: And so are <hi>you</hi> when you are but
seeking your carnal selves, and not serving and
pleasing God in what you undertake.</p>
            <p>Pr. 4. <hi>That the favour all of the world can nothing
stead you if God be not pleased with you, and by you.</hi>
If there were any that could save you from his
wrath, you need not be so solicitous to <hi>please him:</hi>
but if he be not pleased we are all undone. <hi>Thou,
even thou art to be feared and who shall stand when
once thou art angry?</hi> Psal. 76. 7. Isa. 43. 13. When
men have slight thoughts of Gods anger, and the
fear and dread of him is not upon their hearts, no
wonder if they be not careful to <hi>please him:</hi> you
must be convinced, that the <hi>displeasure</hi> of God is
the most formidable thing in the world, or else
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64323:24"/>
you will never learn this great Lesson. Beloved,
if you should please men, and all the world should
be on your side, what would this avail while <hi>God</hi>
is your enemy? If all men should bless you and
speak well of you, what would this profit when
God should rise up in judgment against you and
condemn you? It is not at mans Bar, but Gods
that you must stand: It is not at mens Votes that
you must be cast or quitted. It will not go by most
voices, but God himself is the Judge, <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 7.
In <hi>his Breast</hi> it is whether you shall live or die. If
a man were upon a tryal for his life, what would
it avail him that all his fellow prisoners, and the
whole crowd about him were for him, when the
whole Bench and Jury were against him? If your
Lives and Estates were in question, to whom
would you go to make your friend? the <hi>Iudge</hi>
or the <hi>People?</hi> Sirs, be convinced that if God be
against, you, tis as bad as if God and all the world
were against you. For <hi>all</hi> signifies <hi>nothing</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him. Oh, whatever you do, study to get in
and keep in with him. I tell you, the time is
coming when the breath of men will signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
when their Commendation will do you
no good. O man! though all the world should
give thee their hands, and subscribe thy Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
it would signifie nothing in Gods account, or
his Court. Many build their hopes for Heaven upon
the good opinion that others have of them: But I
tell thee man, though thou couldst carry Letters of
commendation with thee when thou diest, and all
the Ministers of the Gospel should give thee their
<hi>Bene discessit,</hi> all would be no more then a blank
paper; and he would not save thee a jot the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if he should find thee to have been but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64323:25"/>
hypocrite, a rotten-hearted Professor all the
while.</p>
            <p>Pr. 5. <hi>That God would not be pleased with you</hi> in
any thing, except <hi>you make it your care to please
him well in every thing.</hi> You will be one <hi>day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,</hi>
except you have <hi>respect to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
Psal. 119. 6. you have not a <hi>good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
except it be your care <hi>in all things to live
honestly,</hi> Heb. 13. 18. If <hi>Naaman</hi> must be excused
in <hi>one thing,</hi> to bow in the house of <hi>Rimmon</hi> that he
might not displease his Master, this is enough to
spoil every thing, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 18. Some will
needs keep Gods good will and the worlds too,
and so will give both their turns; They will serve
God at home, and conform to the world abroad;
and it shall be a great thing indeed that they will
not swallow, rather then lose the good will of men,
especially great men. These men have two faces,
and two tongues; the one for the good, and the
other for the bad company that they come into.
Some held two <hi>first principles,</hi> the one the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fountain of all good (which is God,) and
the other the cause of all evil, and they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
both the <hi>good principle</hi> for <hi>love,</hi> and the <hi>evil for
fear:</hi> Just such a Religion are many among us
now of. But let them know whoever they are,
that while they grasp all, they lose all: For God
will never own time-servers, nor men-pleasers
for the Servants of Christ, <hi>Ephes. 6. 6. Gal.</hi>
1. 10.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>With reference to your practices.</hi> And here as
ever you desire to come up to this blessed life of
<hi>doing always those things that please God,</hi> you must
carefully follow these six Rules.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64323:25"/>Rule 1. <hi>Look round about you to the whole latitude
and compass of your duty.</hi> Great is the latitude of
Christianity. The <hi>Commandment is exceeding
broad,</hi> Psal. 119. 96. And many Professors do
scarce look more then one way: but while they
intensly mind one thing, they neglect another.
It may be while they are taken up with the care of
<hi>religious</hi> duties, they forget <hi>relative</hi> duties: Or
they are careful of <hi>personal duties,</hi> but very remiss
in the duties that they owe to the souls of their <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;</hi>
Or they complain and mourn over their
<hi>own sins,</hi> but lay not to heart <hi>others</hi> sins: It may
be they are more punctual in their more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
duties towards God, but are very negligent
in their duties towards <hi>men;</hi> or they will spend
much time for their souls, but do little lay to
heart the case of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the misery of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
souls that are round about them. Possible
they keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi> strictly, and pray, and hear,
and fear an oath: but in the mean time make little
conscience of breaking their <hi>promises;</hi> passing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and uncharitable <hi>censures; spending time vainly,</hi>
being <hi>unprofitable</hi> in their <hi>discourse, Close handed</hi>
to godly uses; suffering sin to go unreproved;
letting out their <hi>passions</hi> at every petty cross: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will mind their duty to them that are within,
and in the mean time are very short in their duties
to them that are without. This is too common
a case. Where is the Christian almost that seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
bethinks himself, what might I do to win
souls? It may be you will go into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the godly, where you may be edified, but
when do you go to your poor neighbours, whom
you see to live in a sinful state, and tell him of his
danger, and labour to gain him unto Christ? yea,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64323:26"/>
so much is this great duty neglected, and out of
fashion, that I am afraid many question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a <hi>duty</hi> or no. As if you might let sin lie
upon the soul of your Brother and yet be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. If it were but his Oxe or
his Ass that lay ready to perish, you would make
no question but it were your duty to help him out
of the ditch: And do you think in earnest, that
you owe more to these, then you do to his <hi>soul?</hi>
Is it to <hi>Ministers</hi> only, or to all Believers that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
belongs, Prov. 11. 30. <hi>The fruit of the
righteous is a tree of life, and be that winneth souls
is wise?</hi> Surely the lives of too many Christians
do speak the same language that <hi>Cain</hi> spake with
his mouth, <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> Gen. 4. 9.
'Tis true, God will have you keep every one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of your proper stations, but so as
to take occasions, yea to seek occasions as you are
able to be doing good to others. Do you not
know how to get within your poor neighbours?
Carry an alms with you, do him a kindness, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him by your courteous and winning carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
Then I shall look to see the Kingdom of
Christ flourish gloriously, when every one that
professeth godliness, shall arise and take hold of
the skirt of his neighbour. Oh see your neglects
in this, Do not think it enough to keep your own
Vineyard: Let your Friends and Neighbours
have no quiet for you, till you see them setting in
good earnest to seek after Heaven. Oh if you
might bring in but every one <hi>his man</hi> to Christ,
what a blessed thing were this! I lose my self in
this Argument, but I am content to do so, this
duty being so miserably neglected.</p>
            <p>Too many live as if Religion lay all in <hi>praying</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:64323:26"/>
and <hi>hearing holy conference,</hi> and the like; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that <hi>pure Religion and undefiled is this, to visit
the Fatherless and the Widow in their affliction,</hi> Jam.
1. 27. The other should be so done, as that this
should not be left undone. You make conscience
of being just and true, and faithful; but do you
not forget to win upon others by your kindness
and affableness? as if it were not written in your
Bibles; <hi>be pitiful, be courteous, having compassion one
of another,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 8. Say not, It is not my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
What doth grace serve for, but to correct
the evils of your temper? Is not ours a Religion
of self-denyal? Do not the Rules of our Religion
enjoyn us, to be followers of whatsoever is lovely,
and of good report, and may render Religion ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the world? <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>Rule 2: <hi>Vse a wise forecast, that every duty may
fall in in its time and order; and every work may have
its room.</hi> It is not enough <hi>to do</hi> Gods work, but
it must be done in <hi>his order.</hi> That which in it self
is good and necessary, may be so ill timed, as to
become a sin. It is a duty to tell your Brother of
his sin: but to rip it up in your passion, or to be
retorting upon him when he is christianly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
you is a sin. Your wordly business must
not shut out Religion, nor religious Duties take
you so up, as to neglect your callings. But every
duty must have its place. But for the doing all
in Gods order, Take these Five <hi>Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Begin at home in provoking to
good:</hi> Why should God plead with you? <hi>Thou
that teachest another teachest thou not thy self?</hi> Rom.
2. 21. Be an <hi>example</hi> of thine <hi>own rule,</hi> else the
hypocrites charge will come in against thee. <hi>Mat.</hi>
23. 4. <hi>They bind heavy burdens, but will not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64323:27"/>
touch them with one of their fingers.</hi> Observe Gods
order, <hi>Deut. 6. 6, 7. These words which I command
thee shall be in thine heart.</hi> That must be our <hi>first
care.</hi> And then having got our Lesson well our
selves, we must then Teach it to others: <hi>And thou
shalt teach them diligently to thy children, and tell of
them when thou,</hi> &amp;c. At least if thou hast not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
attained it, be sure to learn with the first:
and when thou pressest a duty, intend thy self first,
and speak most to thine own heart.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In reproving evil:</hi> Otherwise thou wilt be
branded for an hypocrite; <hi>Matth. 7. 5. First cast
the beam out of thine own eye.</hi> We may not think
as many do mistakingly, that we must not reprove
another when we are guilty of the same sin. But
we must in such a case be sure to cast the first stone
at our selves. Be <hi>soonest angry</hi> with thy self, and
<hi>more severe</hi> to thine own sins, then any others.
'Tis strange to see the great <hi>censoriousness of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
to others,</hi> and how tender they are of their
own corruptions, and impatient of reproof:
Reader, fear and avoid this sin.</p>
            <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Let God be first served.</hi> Let God
have the <hi>first</hi> of thy <hi>thoughts,</hi> the first of the <hi>day,</hi>
the first of thy <hi>strength:</hi> How heavily is God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with the prophane Priests, because they
will serve <hi>themselves first</hi> with the Sacrifices before
him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 15, 16. And it is the holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
that one gives: <hi>Hold the door of thy heart fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the world in the morning, till thy heart hath
been first in Heaven, and seasoned and fortified from
thence against the Temptations that thou art like to
meet with assoon as thou comest down below.</hi> Indeed all
must be done as Gods service: but so as that his
<hi>immediate</hi> service must be done <hi>first.</hi> It is the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64323:27"/>
counsel of several Heathens, <hi>That all our undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
should be begun with prayer.</hi> Saith <hi>Aratus, Let
us begin with God:</hi> And the very <hi>Mahumetans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
their Books alwayes as men do use to do their
Wills, <hi>In the Name of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Direct. 3. <hi>First cleanse the inside.</hi> Matth. 23. 26.
<hi>Cleanse first that which is within the Cup.</hi> Though
they are much out that live as if <hi>all</hi> their work
did lie within door, yet remember that it lies
<hi>chiefly</hi> here. Its a most preposterous course in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to begin first with the out-side. Jer. 4. 14. <hi>O
Ierusalem wash thine heart!</hi> when once this is done,
reformation will soon follow in the life, but not
otherwise. Many are careful that all that appears
to men should be beautiful, but their hearts are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected:
These carry upon them the marks of
the hypocrite, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 27, 28. And what will
it profit thee, O vain man, to have all kept secret
from men, since God knows and detests thee? And
hath appointed a day when he will rip open all
thy pack, and anatomize thy heart, before the
world, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 5. Eccles. 12. 14. Rom.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>Direct. 4. <hi>Eye those duties most that are of most
importance,</hi> Matth. 23. 23. The hypocrite is very
punctual in <hi>lesser</hi> matters, but neglects the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
things of the Law, Judgment, and Mercy,
and Faith: He is for a religion that will <hi>cost him
little:</hi> and therefore <hi>words</hi> being <hi>good cheap,</hi> he
will be as forward in talk as any; mighty zealous
in the <hi>circumstantials</hi> of Religion, and marvellous
<hi>censorious</hi> of others that come not up to this mind,
as men of <hi>wide principles</hi> and <hi>large consciences:</hi>
But in the mean time, he is very negligent is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
duties, a great stranger to <hi>self-denyal,</hi> and
<hi>walking humbly with God.</hi> He <hi>strains wonderfully
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64323:28"/>
at a Ceremony;</hi> but it may be he can swallow the
<hi>gains of unrighteousness,</hi> or the baits of intemperance
fast enough: It may be he will <hi>decry Superstition,</hi>
and never wants a stone to fling at a <hi>prophane
Church-man:</hi> But in the mean time <hi>walks loosly</hi>
in his <hi>Family,</hi> makes little conscience of his <hi>deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
or will take up his <hi>Cups</hi> as freely as another
so he be not drunk: Or if he will not take a penny
of his neighbours <hi>estate,</hi> he is most unmerciful to
his <hi>good name,</hi> and will <hi>take up any report that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
Brethren you must make conscience of the
least sin, and of the least duty. But it is a fearful
sign when men are zealous against <hi>lesser sins,</hi> and
yet <hi>connive at greater</hi> (as these are,) <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.
24.</p>
            <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Take the first opportunity when God
gives a fit season for any duty:</hi> Let not Satan beguile
you, by telling you of <hi>another</hi> or a better time. It
may be thou hast a purpose to reprove thy
brother for his sin, but how long wilt thou be a
<hi>purposing? Now</hi> God gives thee an opportuity, it
may be thy backward heart saith, [<hi>not now, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time.</hi>] And so it is <hi>put off,</hi> till he or thy self
are removed, or he is hardned, or at least thou art
guilty of the sin that he commits in the mean
while: because thou hast <hi>not done thy duty</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it. It is in thine heart to deal with thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
friend or neighbour about his spiritual
estate, but it may be while thou <hi>art delaying,</hi> death
comes and snatches him away in his sins, or takes
thee off, and so farewel for ever to any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for doing the soul of thy Brother any good.
How often are our closet-duties hindred, or mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
disturbed for want of care to lay hold on the
first opportunity? we think another hour in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64323:28"/>
day may do as well: but then one thing or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unexpectedly falls in, that nothing in done,
or nothing to purpose. Therefore beware of this
cheat. A man can scarce peep into the world but
one brier and thorn or another will catch him.
Therefore take opportunity by the fore-top. Our
Saviour would take his <hi>season</hi> for prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day, when his other work was pressing,
<hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35.</p>
            <p>Rule 3. <hi>Do nothing of things Sacred without Gods
command: nothing in things Civil without Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance;</hi>
Offer not with strange fire. In Gods
worship you must see you be well able to answer
that question, <hi>Who hath required these things at your
hands?</hi> Here the command must be observed
without adding or diminishing. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. yet
understand this with two Cautions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Though men may not stamp their invented Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
with a moral signification, nor impose nor
use them, though with good intentions of edifying the
people by devised means.</hi> Matth. 15. 9. As if
Christ had not sufficiently provided for the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his people without their devices: And
though nothing may be used as a <hi>part of worship</hi>
that God hath not commanded, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. (for it
is enough to make any thing rejected by the Lord
(of divine worship) if he shall say [<hi>I commanded it
not, spake it not, neither came it into my mind.</hi>] Jer. 7.
31. and 19. 5. Yet nevertheless those things that
are <hi>meerly circumstantial,</hi> and are in their <hi>general
kind</hi> necessary, and not intended as any <hi>part</hi> or
means of worship, may be <hi>determined of by humane
prudence</hi> according to the <hi>general Rules of the Word,</hi>
which must always be observed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. 40.
And for want of understanding, many have igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64323:29"/>
condemned <hi>preaching by an Hour-glass,</hi> in a
<hi>high Place,</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> by way of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Vse,</hi> &amp;c. running from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>2. We may not think that Gods Ordinances
remaining for substance his, may be <hi>forsaken,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of <hi>some faults</hi> of <hi>the administratours,</hi> or in the
<hi>way of their administration.</hi> The <hi>administring</hi> of <hi>Gods
Ordinances</hi> belongs not to the <hi>People,</hi> but to the
<hi>Minister:</hi> And if <hi>he fail in his duty by administring
them in a way that is not fit,</hi> and is <hi>less edifying,</hi>
☞ it is <hi>my grief,</hi> but <hi>his sin. Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi>
were corrupt in their lives, and brought in
much corruption and rudeness into the service of
God: yet <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> with others of the
Godly, did nevertheless attend Gods Worship
and Sanctuary, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 2. Much corruption
was crept in both into the Doctrine and Worship,
and Lives of the Administratours in the Church
of the <hi>Iews:</hi> yet our Saviour (though he
☞ still cried down the Corruptions, and would
not joyn in them) never prohibited Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them in Gods Worship, but enjoyns it,
<hi>Matth. 5. 24. Mark 1. 40. Luke</hi> 5. 14. and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
it, both he, his Parents, and Apostles,
<hi>Luke 2. 21, 22, 24, 39, 41, 42, 46. Acts</hi> 21. 23,
24, 26.</p>
            <p>But now in <hi>things Civil,</hi> it is sufficient that
you have the <hi>allowance</hi> of the Word, though not
the command: always provided that the <hi>general
Rules</hi> be here observed, <hi>to do all to the glory of God,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. And not to abuse our <hi>lawful liberty</hi>
to the offence of others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 21. Now your
actions being thus justifiable as to the <hi>matter</hi> of
them (without which it is impossible, had you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64323:29"/>
so good intentions, of <hi>please God)</hi> the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and verture of <hi>holy Ends</hi> into them will be so
effectual, as to turn all into <hi>religious Duties;</hi> as
the touch of the Philosophers Stone turns the
baser Mettal into Gold.</p>
            <p>Rule 4. <hi>In every action let God be uppermost; but
in religious Actions let God be all.</hi> Let <hi>none</hi> of your
actions <hi>terminate in your selves,</hi> but labour to be
able in sincerity to give this account of any thing
you set about, that this you do <hi>because it is pleasing
unto God, because this is his will</hi> concerning you.
Set a mark upon this Caution. Beware in
those Actions wherein <hi>self</hi> may bear a part, lest
it should sweep Stakes and carry all. You
may in your <hi>common actions</hi> have an eye to your
<hi>outward commodity,</hi> and <hi>comfortable being</hi> in the
world: but this must not be the <hi>chief thing</hi> much
less <hi>the all</hi> that you design herein: for by looking
no higher then <hi>self</hi> you incur this double mischief.
1. You lose so much from your own account.
2. You usurp upon the great Prerogatives of God.
I fear we are not aware of the fearful evil that is
in <hi>self-seeking;</hi> It is no less then justling God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the Throne, and setting our selves in his room.
It is Gods great Prerogative, and the proper
Worship that is due to him as God, that he
should be the <hi>last end of all the operations of us
his Creatures,</hi> and that all our motions should ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in him. Now when we eye our <hi>own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity</hi>
and <hi>not God;</hi> or look to <hi>this more</hi> then unto
God, we arrogate the divine Prerogative to our
selves, and set our selves above him, which is no
less then hainous Idolatry: And if it be such a
hainous sin to bow down to an Image, which is
but the giving Gods <hi>outward worship</hi> to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64323:30"/>
how much more to seek and honour our
selves before God? which is to give his <hi>inward
worship,</hi> which of all is the principal, to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Oh how many that pass for good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will be found heinous Idolaters! because they
have sought their own carnal ends more then God
and his glory. And many real Christians, though
they mainly design God and his glory, yet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular actions contract great guilt by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no higher then themselves in what they do. I
know you cannot be alwayes thinking of God:
yet I would have you never to forget what you
have been taught, In the entrance of every solemn
action to remember God and make him <hi>your end,
Lie down</hi> in the Name of God every <hi>Evening:</hi> Go
forth in his Name <hi>every Morning,</hi> resolving to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
all for him. When you enter upon your
Callings, sit down to your Meals, make any Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or visit, do it as unto the Lord, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to <hi>please him therein.</hi> This you may come to
with care and watchfulness.</p>
            <p>Again, In <hi>religious actions</hi> let <hi>God be all.</hi> Here
<hi>self (I mean carnal self,</hi>) must be shut out: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
this dead Flie will spoil the Box of most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Oyntment. 'Tis true, <hi>self</hi> will be crowding
in, but you must knock it down carefully: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if this be the predominant ingredient, all your
duties will be but lost labour. What more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God then <hi>prayer?</hi> This is as <hi>incense</hi> before
him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 2. what more delightful then
<hi>alms?</hi> This is a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing
unto him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18. How happy a
Testimony had <hi>Cornelius, Thy Prayers and Alms
are come up as a memorial before God!</hi> Acts
10. 4. Yet when <hi>self</hi> is predominant in those
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64323:30"/>
Duties, <hi>Prayers, Alms,</hi> &amp;c. all are lost, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.
7. and 23. 5.</p>
            <p>Rule 5. <hi>When you have done all, be careful to deny
all, Luke</hi> 17. 10. not denying <hi>Gods mercy</hi> in inabling
and assisting you: This must be with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
observed: But attributing nothing to your
selves, and giving God all the glory. Take the
pattern of holy <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 14. <hi>But who
am I, and what is my people, that we should offer so
willingly? of thine own have we given thee.</hi>] And of
Blessed <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>Not I, but the grace of
God which was with me.</hi>] And of good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
who when he had done most eminent service for
God, flies at last to pardoning mercy, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 13. 22.
<hi>Remember me, O God, concerning this also; and
spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rule 6. <hi>Do all in the Name of the Lord Iesus,
Col.</hi> 3. 17. Having carefully set out for God in
the morning, and directed your common actions
to <hi>him</hi> as <hi>your end,</hi> throughout the day, doing all
as in his sight, and with a desire to please him
therein, bring all to <hi>Christ in the evening,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
all unto God by him, confidently expecting
Gods acceptance and reward for all that you have
done. For this he hath promised, be your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
never so mean, because they were <hi>done as his
service, Col. 3. 22, 23, 24. Ephes.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. If
you neglect this, you lose all at last: For God
will accept of no Sacrifice but from the hand of
the <hi>Priest:</hi> and therefore you must look for no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with God, nor any reward from him,
but only through Christ, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. Iohn</hi> 14. 6.
You must be sure therefore not only to make a
formal mention of Christs Name, but to build all
your hope of success only upon him, and to come
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64323:31"/>
to GOD with an Actual and Lively dependance
upon him:—</p>
            <p>Thus I have resolved the Case propounded. I
will but Answer an Objection, and briefly
press your Duty by some Motives, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> You bind heavy burdens: what must
we be always in the traces? surely this severity
of Religion is more then needs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Burden man! why, it is thy Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
If Holiness and pleasing God be a burden,
Health is a burden; Heaven and Happiness are
burdens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. This is no other burden then what
<hi>God himself</hi> hath bound upon your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
<hi>Rom. 9. 20. Who art thou, O man, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliest
against God!</hi> Have I put upon you a devised
and unnecessary strictness? or bound that burden
upon you which I will not touch with one of my
fingers? 1 Cor. 9. 8. <hi>Say I this as a man, or saith
not the Law the same also?</hi> I pray you whose word
is this? <hi>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day
long,</hi> Prov. 23. 17. <hi>Do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor.
10. 31. <hi>Exercise thy self unto godliness,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 7.
What have I pressed but what the Saints have
practiced? Phil. 3. 13, 14. <hi>One thing I do, I press
towards the mark,</hi> Psal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of the Lord, that I will seek after.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 38. <hi>Thy servant that is devoted to thy fear.</hi>
Gen. 5. 22. <hi>Enoch walked with God three hundred
years.</hi> What is this but what the Scripture hath
foretold shall be? <hi>They shall walk up and down in
the Name of the Lord,</hi> Zech. 10. 12. <hi>There shall be
upon the Bells of the Horses, and every Pet in</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<hi>Holniess to the Lord,</hi> Zech. 14. 20, 21. Dispute
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64323:31"/>
not against God, but up and be doing. It's an
ill sign when the heart rises against the strictness
of the duty: you utterly mistake in thinking this
life of strictness to be a bondage. Who have joy
unspeakable and full of glory? Who do know the
peace that passeth all understanding, if not those
that do thus walk with God?</p>
            <p>Now, my Brethren, let me beseech you to be
the conscientious Practitioners of this great Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Study to do always those things that are
<hi>pleasing unto God.</hi> Oh that I knew but how to
engage you; that I could but get you to set these
Rules before you all the days of your lives for your
practice! 'Tis not enough that you give the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and like the Preacher, and approve the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
But Sirs, what will you do? Too many
of my Hearers are like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s, Chap. 33. 32.
What say you Brethren, will you learn with me?
O that I might lead you on to a through acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the strictness and power of Religion,
and to that holy frame that will be <hi>Gods delight</hi>
and your <hi>felicity.</hi> Brethren, what seek I for? God
knows this is my ambition, that I may but help
you on in the way of holiness: I would not that
you should be such bad Proficients, as to be always
of the lower form, and to keep on meerly in a dull
and barren course. My desire for you is, that you
should not be Shrubs, but Cedars, of tall growth,
choice Experience, singular Communion, walking
with God, shining to the conviction of the world.
Will you let me but prevail with you in so good a
Design? why should you mourn at the last, and
say, <hi>How have I hated Instruction, and my heart
despised Reproof! I have not obeyed the voice of my
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64323:32"/>
Teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed
me,</hi> Prov. 5. 11, 12, 13. That I may incite you
to this holy course, Consider,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is very possible:</hi> for first, <hi>God is very easie
to be pleased:</hi> He is not like a froward Master that
cannot, that will not be pleased: If you do but
make it your <hi>study</hi> and your <hi>care</hi> to <hi>please him,</hi> and
throughly set your hearts to it, your willing mind
shall be accepted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. And though you
should not go through with the work, God will
say, <hi>thou didst well that it was in thine heart,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 8. when the <hi>heart is set</hi> to please the
Lord, and we do unfeignedly put to it, though
there by very many failings, God will overlook
them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hath <hi>told you what will please him,</hi>
and hath cut out your work to your hand. You
need not say, <hi>Wherewith shall we come before the
Lord? he hath shewed you what is good, and what
he requireth of you,</hi> Micah 6. 6, 7, 8. You need not
say, <hi>Who shall ascend into Heaven to bring down the
mind of God from Heaven?</hi> No, <hi>the word is nigh
you,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. God hath set before you in
his Law as in a Table, on one side the things that
<hi>please,</hi> on the other, those that displease him: oh
that you may be found among those that <hi>choose the
things that please him,</hi> Isa. 56. 4, 5. Otherwise
since <hi>you know your Masters will, and yet do it not,</hi>
you will be found worthy of <hi>many stripes,</hi> Luke
12. 47.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>God hath given particular Rules for the
doing of all your work in that manner, that will please
him.</hi> Had God told you only <hi>what must be done,</hi>
and not <hi>how</hi> it must be done; you might have
been at a loss: but he hath prescribed the very
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64323:32"/>
               <hi>manner,</hi> how every thing must be done, that you
might have full direction, <hi>Rom. 12. 8. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 11.
He hath shewed you how you must pray, and hear,
and give alms: how you must carry it in all your
relations: he hath told you not only how you
must fast, but how you must eat, to wit, with
watchfulness, and temperance; not as those who
have nothing to do, but to fill their paunches; but
with an eye to his glory, as those that are feeding
and relieving the servants of Jesus Christ. He
hath shewed you, not only how you should <hi>rest on
the Lords Day,</hi> but how you must follow your
Calling on the rest, to wit, with diligence and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
minding him as your end, as those that
herein serve the Lord Christ. He hath told you
how you must manage your dealings, with equity
and charity, doing the very same to others, that
your consciences tell you you would have them in
the like case to do unto you: how you must <hi>sleep,</hi>
even as those that know he <hi>compasseth</hi> your <hi>path
and your lying down;</hi> and how you must wake; to
wit, so as to <hi>be still with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>God hath given you special helps to this
end:</hi> You <hi>have the mind of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 16. and
you have the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. Indeed
<hi>they that are in the flesh cannot please God:</hi> but <hi>you
are not in the flesh, but in the spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 8, 9.
You that are Believers have not the Law only in
your Bibles, but in <hi>your hearts,</hi> Heb. 8. 10.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>It is very profitable: Glorious advantages
shall you have by this course.</hi> First, this is the most
speedy and certain way to <hi>assurance:</hi> for want of
which many of you complain; but henceforth
you must complain no more: For either you <hi>will
follow</hi> this course, and then you will have it:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64323:33"/>
or you <hi>will not,</hi> and then cease your hypocritical
complaints, when it is through your own wilful,
disobedience that you are without it. When once
you are habituated to this course, and do find it to
be the chief of your care, and that which your very
hearts are set upon above all things else, to <hi>glorifie
and please God, and approve your selves in his sight,</hi>
you cannot want assurance, unless through your
own ignorance: For this is the most undoubted
evidence in the world, that you are the children of
God, whatever unallowed failings you may be
guilty of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hereby you shall be certain of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and favourable presence always with you. <hi>See
the Text,</hi> He that sent me is with me; for I do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
those things that please him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>By this means you shall be always laying
up a Treasure in Heaven:</hi> Brethren, <hi>what are you for?</hi>
Are you men for Eternity, or are you for present
things? Is your <hi>design</hi> for Glory, Honour and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality?
Are you for riches in the other world?
or of dunghil spirits, preferring your part in <hi>Paris</hi>
before a part in <hi>Paradise?</hi> If you are for true
riches, here is your way; By this you shall be daily
and hourly encreasing the stock of your own glory:
my vehemency is only, that fruit may abound to
your account; that all you do might meet you in
Heaven, and Christ may shew your good works
another day, as the Widows did <hi>Dorcas</hi> her Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 39.</p>

            <p>WHat weariness in, and unwillingness to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may stand with grace, and what not?</p>
            <p>For the resolving this, some Distinctions must
be premised, and then some Conclusions eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Distinct.</hi> This <hi>weariness</hi> and <hi>unwillingness</hi> must
be distinguished, 1. According to the <hi>degrees</hi> of
it, and so it is either <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>gradual,</hi> or else
<hi>prevalent</hi> and <hi>plenary.</hi> 2. According to the <hi>subject</hi>
of it: and so this <hi>weariness</hi> is either of the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
or else of the <hi>mind:</hi> 3. According to the
<hi>prevalency</hi> of it, and so it is either <hi>transient</hi> and <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional,</hi>
or else <hi>setled</hi> and <hi>habitual.</hi> 4. According
to the <hi>sense</hi> we have of it, and so it is either matter
of <hi>Allowance</hi> to us, or matter of <hi>annoyance.</hi> 5. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>cause</hi> of it, and so it is either from
a <hi>fixed dislike of the food,</hi> or else from an <hi>Accidental
distemper</hi> of the stomach. 6. According to the
<hi>effects</hi> of it: for either it is <hi>victorious</hi> and makes us
give over duties, or else <hi>abhorred</hi> and repulsed by
grace, the Christian still holding on in the way
of Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclu.</hi> 1. Where the weariness is <hi>only</hi> in the
<hi>Members</hi> (or at least <hi>chiefly</hi>) but there is still a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness</hi>
of the <hi>mind,</hi> this is no matter of question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Estates: where the <hi>mind</hi> out-goes and out-does
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64323:34"/>
the <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>appetite</hi> to duties continues
in vigour, though there be a languishing of the
<hi>natural strength,</hi> and weariness of the <hi>bodily organs,</hi>
this is not our sin but affliction. But too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the <hi>body</hi> hath so much influence upon the
<hi>mind,</hi> and causeth a listlesness and sluggishness
there, and makes it negligent in its office: Yet
when this doth proceed from the failing of the
spirits tired with bodily labour and exercise, and
from the distemper of the parts, our most pitiful
Father considers our frame, and remembers we
are but dust: and our merciful High Priest that is
not untouched with the sense of our infirmities is
ready to frame our excuse, <hi>that the spirit is willing
but the flesh is weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Where our <hi>weariness</hi> in and <hi>unwillingness</hi> to
duties, is only <hi>gradual</hi> and <hi>partial,</hi> not <hi>plenary</hi>
and <hi>prevalent,</hi> it is not sufficient to conclude our
selves graceless: While the twins are together in
the womb, and two Nations within our bowels,
there will be contrary inclinations. The flesh will
never say <hi>Amen,</hi> to a good motion as such, but will
be lusting against the spirit, and will hang back
when the spirit puts forwards, and pull down
when the spirit bends upwards: So that while
corruption remaineth, there will be always a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting</hi>
party, and continual conflicts: from
whence it is no wonder there should arise some
weariness: yet the <hi>spirit</hi> is the <hi>prevailing interest,</hi>
and though oft-times <hi>fayled,</hi> yet hath <hi>mostly</hi> the
mastery in the combate, and carries it against the
flesh, though not without much resistance and
reluctancy from the rebel opponent.</p>
            <p>3. Where this <hi>weariness</hi> is only <hi>transient,</hi> during
the present temptation or defection, which assoon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64323:34"/>
as the tired soul can get out of, it returns to its
former temper and pleasure in holy duties, there
is only matter of <hi>humiliation.</hi> But when it is the
<hi>setled permanent</hi> and <hi>babitual</hi> frame of the mind, it
is matter of questioning our conditions. The
holy Psalmist under a dissertion was even almost
perswaded to give over with Religion; but when
he is <hi>himself</hi> nothing is so sweet, nothing so lovely
and desirable to him as the duties of holiness. But
for them who have in their ordinary setled course
and frame, <hi>no mind</hi> to duties, but are <hi>halled</hi> to
them by conscience, or engaged by <hi>company</hi> or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
or the like, their case is fearful in that
measure that duty is unpleasing and not
loved.</p>
            <p>4. Where this <hi>weariness</hi> of, and <hi>unwillingness</hi> to
Duties is <hi>paniful</hi> and <hi>grievous,</hi> as a sore in the eye,
as a sickness in the heart, the state is good: But
where it is <hi>naturally allowed,</hi> and meets with little
or no resistance, it is a black mark: for this argues
there is nothing but flesh, that there is no contrary
principle in such a heart. For if there were, the
spirit would at least make opposition: This was
the very frame of those unsanctified sinners that
counted the Sabbaths and Service of God an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
burden, a very <hi>weariness,</hi> a <hi>bondage</hi> not
to be born, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. A gracious heart when
under such a distemper, as that Gods service
seems a <hi>weariness,</hi> is even weary of himself: while
<hi>this</hi> is <hi>burdensome</hi> he is a <hi>burden to himself:</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enjoy himself, while in such a frame wherein
he cannot enjoy God: and if this be the Case, our
State is good though the frame be bad.</p>
            <p>5. Where this <hi>weariness</hi> and <hi>unwillingness</hi> is,
not from a <hi>rooted dislike</hi> of the food, but an <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64323:35"/>
and <hi>preter natural indisposition</hi> of the stomach,
or being disappointed of Gods presence in duties,
the main state is safe. You know under a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the appetite may disgust, and nauseate the food
that a man doth love above all other meats when
he is well: and so it is here: Do you when you
are your selves, relish more sweetness in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
then in your Meats and Drinks? are no
sweets so delightful to you as fellowship and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God when you can attain to it in
duties? Do you come away discontented because
you cannot meet with God? Is the ground why
your countenances fall, and your hearts be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
because you have (with them) toyled and
spread the net, and have not caught what you
went for; because you have no answer nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
from God? If it be thus, it is a sign your
hearts be set upon God, and that you place the
happiness and comfort of your lives in God, and
so that your state is safe: Otherwise when there
is a <hi>fixed antipathy</hi> to duties, and an <hi>habitual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
of them and <hi>contrariety</hi> to them, the Case is
very sad.</p>
            <p>6. Where our <hi>weariness</hi> and <hi>unwillingness</hi> is
such as makes us to <hi>give over</hi> our <hi>duties,</hi> so as to
live in the <hi>ordinary neglect</hi> of them, it is a fearful
sign: but where notwithstanding present discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
we hold on in the performance of
our duties, and a humble waiting upon God for
removal of our difficulties till we are brought to a
better frame, this argues well. The Church her
self may be greatly deserted: but then she gives
not over duties, but seeks after her beloved,
and makes diligent enquiring, and will not be at
rest until she hath found him. But the hypocrite
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64323:35"/>
gives up and will not wait upon the Lord any
longer. Not but that a deserted soul, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the violence of temptations omit duties for a
time: But his condition this while is most <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
restless</hi> and <hi>grievous</hi> to him, and he quickly
returns-again, and never comes to live in a quiet,
and ordinary omission of known duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclu.</hi> 7. When our <hi>weariness</hi> and <hi>unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is such as makes us <hi>fall out</hi> with the service of
Christ, and willing to ease our selves of his yoke,
and to throw off his burden: This is a bad sign.
But when we fall out with <hi>our selves;</hi> and justifie
and approve Christs Ways and Service, it is
well. Thus it was with <hi>Paul:</hi> he doth not
quarrel with the Law as too strict, and too
severe, nor think of breaking off his bonds, and
taking his liberty, but he pleads for the Law,
and greatly approves it, and commends it, and
condemns the backwardness of his own nature,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. 25. When men are more willing to
be rid of Christs burden, then of the distemper
that makes it grievous, and cast about for ease,
by widening their bonds, and not by bringing
their minds to them, it is a woful discovery of
an unsound heart. And thus much for this
Case.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>Vnconverted,</hi> there are these Six <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi>
which I would advise them daily to put to
their Souls.</p>
               <p>Q. I. <hi>What estate did my Soul come into the world
in?</hi> Was it not in a state of <hi>Death, Ephes.</hi> 2. 1.
An estate of <hi>Wrath? Verse</hi> 3. Sirs, awake and
bethink your selves where you are, and whither
you are going. While you are in your natural
unconverted unbelieving state, all your sins are
unpardoned, and the wrath of God abideth on
you, <hi>Acts 3. 19. Iohn</hi> 3. 36. Suppose you saw
a poor creature hanging over a burning fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
by nothing but a twine-thred like to break
every moment, would not your hearts shake for
such a one? Sirs, it is your very case, you hang
over the infernal burnings by nothing but the
small thred of your lives, which you know not
but it may crack the next moment, and then
where are you? Is this a Case for you to go on
merrily, and contentedly in?</p>
               <p>Q. II. <hi>What condition is my soul now in?</hi> Am
I changed and renewed by conversion, or am I
not? Speak Conscience, hath this man, this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64323:36"/>
man been soundly and savingly changed both in
heart and life? where are your evidences? Can you
shew the marks of the Lord Jesus upon your souls?
Let your conscience answer: where was the
place? what was the means? when was
the time, that thy soul was throughly renewed?
At least if you cannot shew the <hi>time, place,</hi>
nor <hi>means,</hi> can you prove the <hi>thing?</hi> Can you
say with him [one thing I know, that whereas
I was blind I now see.] Sirs, be not deceived, I
tell you whatever you be, and whatever you do,
nothing will avail you to salvation except you be
<hi>new creatures,</hi> Gal. 6. 15.</p>
               <p>Q. III. <hi>What if I should lose my soul?
What fair work should I make of it then?</hi> This
is very possible, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26. Yea it is the
case of the most: There are but few, few of
the children of men that do escape safe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 14. Sirs, be aware of your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and fear lest a promise being left of entring
into Rest, any of you should at last come short
of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. Suppose a man were to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
through some perilous Wood or Wilderness,
having but one Jewel in all the world, in which
his <hi>All</hi> was bound up, and should see some
stand on one hand and some on the other, and
hear one company in this place and another in
that, crying out under the hands of some cruel
Robbers: Oh in what fear would this Traveller
go least he should lose this Jewel, and be Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of all at once? Why thou art the man. This
Traveller is thy self; This Jewel is thy Soul;
This Wilderness or Wood is this World thou
art to Travel through. Swarms of sins, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Devils, a whole world of Temptations,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64323:37"/>
these are the Robbers that lie in wait for thy
Soul: and if all that these can do can keep thee
out of Heaven thou shalt never come there. Oh
what if thy Pride, or worldliness, thy delays,
and triflings in Religion, should at last betray
thy Soul into the Robbers hands? Other losses
may be repaired; But thy Soul being once lost,
God is lost, Christ is lost, Heaven, all lost for
evermore.</p>
               <p>Q. IV. <hi>What do I do for my Soul?</hi> What
have I a Soul and immortal Soul to care for, and
look no better after it, nor bestow no more of
my time, nor pains upon it, no more of my
thoughts about it? When <hi>Augustus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
saw the out-Landish Women carrying <hi>Apes,</hi>
and such kind of strange Creatures in the
Streets in their Armes, he asked what! have the
Women in these Countries no children? So it may
be said of many among us, that are early and late
at their worldly business, but let the care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
lie by neglected; what have these men
no Souls? why man hast thou a <hi>Soul,</hi> and yet dost
so little in thy Closet, so little in thy Family,
from day to day for it? what meanest thou O
sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, that thou
perish not, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 6. what will become
of thy Soul, it thou lookest to it onely at this
careless rate?</p>
               <p>Q. V. <hi>What if God should this night require
thy Soul? where would death land thee?</hi>
Luke 12. 19, 20. There was one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
himself many <hi>merry daies,</hi> and <hi>years,</hi>
as it is like thou doest, but that same night
God called for his Soul. Sirs are you in your
postures? are you fit to die? oh dare not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64323:37"/>
to live in such a case, nor in that course in
which you would not dare to die?</p>
               <p>Q. VI. <hi>What a happy case were I in if I
had but secured my Soul?</hi> oh if this were but
once done, how sweetly mightest thou live!
Then thou mightest eat thy bread, and drink
thy wine with a merry heart, when assured
that God accepteth thee and thy worke, <hi>Eccle.</hi>
9. 7. Then thou mightest lie down in peace,
and rise up in peace; go out and come in in
peace: then thou mightest look death in the face,
thou mightest look dangers in the face, yea, look
Devils in the face, and never be afraid. Oh
Sirs if there be any ensurance office for Souls in
all the world, one would think you should be
seeking to it. And thus much for the <hi>Questions,</hi>
which though of use to all, yet were intended
chiefly for unconverted impenitent Souls.</p>

                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:64323:38"/>Coun. II. <hi>That you value no mercy barely as it
serves in content to your flesh; but as it stands in
order to Eternity; and may serve to the furthering
of your Makers Glory.</hi> God hath <hi>preserved</hi> your
liberties, and hath restored mine: But what
of all this? unless we improve our liberties for
Eternity, what are we better then those that are
in Prison? If this be all the advantage we have,
a little more content to our flesh. The Cypher
put to the Figure is of great consideration, but
put by it self it signifies nothing at all. These
Creature comforts separated from their respect
to God, and Eternity, are of no value: but
in order to these ends, they signifie much. We
have ease and fullness, when many others are
in pains, and in poverty; And we have much
the start of them if we be wise to improve our
health in laying in apace against a wet day,
and preparing apace for Eternity: and if we
serve the Lord with the more abundant diligence,
and chearfulness, and gladness of heart, in the
abundance of all things. But if this be all we
have by it, that our bones do lie a little softer,
and our pallats are tickled with a little the
more delight, what profit have we by our health,
or our estates? If they that be sick, or poor do
love the Lord as well, or serve the Lord as
much as we, they have the advantage of us; and
better were it for us to be poor and sick as
they be.</p>
               <p>Coun. III. <hi>Rest not in probabilities for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but labour for certainties. Beloved, certainty
may be had: or else the counsel of God to make our
Calling and Election sure were in vain,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10.
Else the experience of the Saints were but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64323:38"/>
who tell us they know they are passed
from death to life, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 14. 2 Cor. 5. 1.
Iob</hi> 19. 25. 26. else the power of self-reflection
were to no purpose, and the spirit which is in
man should not know the things of the man,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. Now if a <hi>certainty may be had,</hi>
will you not put in for it, and turn every stone
but that you will get it? Sirs, now if ever, you
have need to put hard to it to get assurance:
We are at miserable uncertainties for all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enjoyments; we know not how soon we
may be called to part with them all: Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
what do you mean? will you be content
to have <hi>nothing</hi> sure? will you not settle your
everlasting conditions, now you are so unsetled
as to your outward condition? What will you
do in the day of visitation, when extremity
comes upon you, if you have not assurance
that God will receive you? It would make
ones heart tremble to think of being put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a fearful temptation to part with all for
Christ, and not to be sure of him neither?
O man, what an advantage will the tempter
now have upon thee, when he shall suggest
[wilt thoube such a fool as to let go all at once?
Thou seest Heaven is not sure, Christ is not
sure, therefore keep the world while thou
hast it, and hold what thou hast sure:] Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
what a fearful slighting of God and contempt
of Heaven and Glory and all the Promises doth
this argue, that you can be content to be at
uncertainties, whether they be yours or not?
How many of you be there that do not know
whether you be going to Heaven or to Hell?
and what desperate carelesness doth this argue,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64323:39"/>
to go on from week to week in such a case?
Some hopes you have that you shall do well,
but put not me off with hopes, never be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
till you are able to say, not only, I <hi>hope</hi> I
<hi>shall be saved, but I know I am passed from
death to life; I know that when the earthly house
of this Tabernacle shall be dissolved, I have a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
not made with hands,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 5. 1.</p>
               <p>Coun. IV. <hi>Be not satisfied with the truth of
Grace, but reach after the Growth.</hi> Do not think
all is done when you have attained the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Grace; but put on hard towards the
increase. That person that doth not desire and
design perfection, never came up to Sincerity.
He that desires Grace truly, desires it not barely
as a Bridg to Heaven, and so to seek no more
then will just bear his charges thither: but
he desires it for its <hi>own</hi> sake; And therefore
desires the height of it. That person that
desires Grace only for Heavens sake, and
inquires what is the lowest measure of Grace
that any one may have and come to Heaven
(by which he meaneth but to be saved from
misery) upon this design, that if he could but
come to that pitch he would desire no more,
that person is rotten at the heart. Christans,
the Lord doth expect of you, that you should
not be Babes and Dwarfs, He looks now
especially that you should make some progresse:
What do you more then heretofore? What! do
you feel his spurs in your sides, and his whip
at your backs; And yet never mend your
pace in Religion, nor stir one jot the faster?
Let me commend to you <hi>Pauls</hi> study <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.
12. 13. 14. It argues a base and unworthy
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64323:39"/>
spirit to content our selves with little things in
Religion.</p>
               <p>Coun. V. <hi>Labour that Holiness may become
your nature, and Religion your business.</hi> Then
you are come to somewhat indeed in Religion,
when the work of God is become your <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and beloved imployment, your Meat and
Drink, your Work and Wages. When your
Tongues and Hearts do as <hi>naturally</hi> run on God,
as others on and of the world: much of that
may be attained by constant care and prayer. Brethren
let Gods work be done by you, not by
the by, but as your greatest businesse: <hi>Seek
first the Kingdome of God</hi> Matth. 6. 33. And
so wherever you be, you may be able to give
that account of your selves, that our Saviour
did when they enquired of him, <hi>That you are
about your Fathers business,</hi> Luke 2. 59.</p>
               <p>Coun. VI. <hi>Confine not your Religion to your
knees, but carry on an even spun thred of Holiness
through your whole Course.</hi> Brethren, 'tis the
disgrace of Religion that Christians are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
themselves, unless it be when they are in
holy duties. This wounds Religion to the
quick, when it shall be said of Professors, these
men indeed will pray like <hi>Angels,</hi> but for ought
we can see they are as <hi>Peevish,</hi> and as <hi>Touchy</hi> as
any other men, and they are as <hi>Hard</hi> in their
<hi>Dealings,</hi> and make as little Conscience of
their <hi>Words</hi> as others do. Beloved, think
not Religion lies only or cheifly in <hi>Praying,
Hearing, Reading.</hi> No you must be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Religous. Sirs, bring forth your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
out of your Closets into your ordinary
Course. Let there not be a life of Holiness on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64323:40"/>
the outside of the Cloth: But Let Holiness
be woven into the whole of your Conversations.
Here lies the excellency &amp; difficulty of Religion:
when you have the baits of <hi>intemperance</hi> before
you, then to hold the Reins hard, and deny
your flesh: when you have <hi>provocation</hi> before
you, then to bite in your passions, and bridle
the unruly member? When you have <hi>dealings</hi>
with <hi>others,</hi> then to proceed by that golden
rule of Equity and Charity, <hi>To do to others as
your Consciences tell you, you would have them
do in the like case to you.</hi> When you are called
upon in your several relations, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
your selves with that tenderness and
love, with that reverence and obedience, with
that courtesie and condescension, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that becomes you in your various capacities;
In this I say lies the Excellency of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coun. VII. <hi>Ever walk with your End in
your Eye.</hi> It is true, according to the usual
and useful similitude, The Traveller thinks not
of his Journeyes end every step, nor need he:
yet there is no Traveller but thinks of it at
his setting out: Brethren, there is nothing
hinders but that with Prayer and Watchfulness
you might come to this, in <hi>every solemn action
to mind God as your End:</hi> Impose this upon
your selves as your daily rule to walk by,
never to lie down but with these thoughts
[<hi>Well I will make use of my Bed as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God for my natural refreshment, that
a weary Servant of his may be fitted for his
work.</hi>] Never to rise up but with these thoughts
<hi>I will set forth this day in the Name of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64323:40"/>
Lord, and make it my business this day throughout
to please him:</hi>] Never to set to your callings
but in the entrance to think thus [<hi>I will set
about my employment in obedience to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is his will, that I should walk with him
in my place and station.</hi>] Never to sit down
to your Tables but thinking [<hi>I will now Eat
and Drink not meerly to feed my flesh, but to
cherish a Servant of Christ Iesus, that he may
have strength for his service:</hi>] Charge this upon
your selves, and examine in the evening, how
you have minded it, and check your selves
wherein you come short. Once learn this, and
you are come up to something: and you shall
have the undoubted evidence of your sincerity,
and shall know the inside of that blessed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of walking with God.</p>
               <p>Coun. VIII. <hi>Be and do more then ordinary
in your Familys, and Closets now in the defects of
the more Publick Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. In your <hi>Closets:</hi> See that your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
be able to bear you witness, that under
Gods extraordinary providences, you do more
then ever in answer thereunto. It may be you
Prayed twice in the day heretofore; why
should you not at such a time as this is, make
one visit more then ordinary to Heaven, daily
to represent before God the calamites of his
Church. This be sure of, that somewhat more
then heretofore must now be done, else God
will look upon himself as intollerably slighted;
and upon his Church as most unnaturally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
if we do not now put to it. Be more
then ever in self-examination. God doth look
that when he is trying of us, we should be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64323:41"/>
much in the trial of our selves. And here let
me put it to your Consciences: How are your
rules for daily examination looked after? Do
you try your selves by them from day to day?
Ah wretched negligence! what have you given
your approbation and passed your promise, and
yet even in such a day as this so much forget
your duty? God expects it of you, that now
you see him angry, you should with more
jealous fear and tender circumspecton and holy
watchfulness and self-denial walk before him;
else you will greatly incense his indignation,
when he shall see that you slight his anger.</p>
               <p>2. In your <hi>Families:</hi> Christians, now the
Lord calls aloud upon you to set your houses
in order. Oh see what is amiss in them, and
strive to cast out that which may be a provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Three things I advise you to with reference
to your Families.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That you set up the Solemn exercise of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising
weekly among them:</hi> Methinks I would
not question but that in every Godly Family
there is a care of the <hi>Catechisme.</hi> But when Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
do onely impose it in general upon
their Families; and occasionally take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
I find but little progress is made: and
therefore I beseech you, to make it a <hi>Solemn,
standing, and constant exercise;</hi> and to expect of
your children and servants as due an account
weekly of what they have learnt in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Religion, as of any business of your
own. Oh the incredible benefit that would
speedily come of this, if I could but perswade
and prevail with my hearers in so small a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
as this!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64323:41"/>2. <hi>That you be often enquiring into their spiritual
estates;</hi> Follow them close, and let them have
no quiet till you see they seriously mind and
seek spirituall things. Put them upon secret
Prayer: Provide helps for them till they are
able to go without them: Shew them often
the necessity of Regeneration, and Conversion,
and the nature thereof. Put them in mind of
the fearfull misery of an unregenerate estate.
Ask them often whether they are Converted
or not. Shew them the danger of delaying
in such a case. Beloved, 'tis too sadly evident
that as the Ordinances are now somwhere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
there is little of Conversion work like to
be done. Oh you Governours of Families, do
but your duty in your several places, and I
doubt not but many Souls will nevertheless be
Born to Christ, even in such a day as this.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Call them to an account of their proficiency by
every opportunity.</hi> If there be but a Sermon, or a
Chapter read, let them give you some account
of it. Thus our Saviour, when the Disciples
(his Family) were in private, he was asking
them whether they did understand, and profit
by what they heard in publick.—<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 1.</p>
               <p>Coun. IX. <hi>Be not discouraged by the present
Difficulties of Religion, but rather rejoyce in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to shew your Love and Loyalty to your
Lord.</hi> Do not think God hath dealt hardly
with you now your Religion is like to cost you
something, and presently think of shrinking,
and drawing back to preserve your safety: If
you do love the Lord Jesus you should Rejoyce,
and be exceeding glad in the opportunity to shew
it. Brethren, what hath your Religion cost
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64323:42"/>
you hitherto? And for shame suffer not your
shrinking, and withdrawing to tell the world
that you have not Love enough to Christ to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
you to run any hazard for him. Do you
indeed Love the Lord? oh then now rejoyce
and be exceeding glad, for never had you such
an opportunity in all your lives to shew your
Love as now; For never were you called to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
so for him, and his service, as now you
be. Now resolve, that if Religion will make
you Vile, you will be yet more Vile; and let
your Zeal and resolution for God be intended
and heightened by the opposition.</p>

               <p>THis holy Sacrament is appointed as a
Sealing Ordinance between Christ and you.
The Covenants are made, the terms agreed to
on both sides; God is willing to be yours to
all intents and purposes; your Shield and
exceeding great Reward, your Refuge and your
Rest, your God, and your Guide. While
Christ hath it you shall never want; and what
God is to him, that he (in your order) will be
to you.</p>
               <p>You again (through grace) are willing to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64323:42"/>
be his: His in his own way, and on his own
terms: willing to serve him; willing to fashion
your selves after him, willing to be betrothed
to him and to be commanded by him; to use
his remedies, to follow his counsels, and to
acquiesce in him as your Blessedness: Thus all
are agreed; the Articles are drawn; The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
both on Gods part and yours are ready
written: And here you are come to put all past
controversie, and mutually to seal and subscribe:
Oh happy and blessed meeting! Christians,
do not forget your errand, Remember where
you are, and what you are come for, and know
that you are upon the solemnest transaction that
ever passed between the Creator and the Creature:
It is Gods admirable condescention that he will
be tied to us, and enter into bonds to us, to bless
us, and reward us. And because our <hi>Faith</hi> is
weak he hath brought his <hi>Surety</hi> with him, the
Lord Jesus Christ, who is a Surety on <hi>his part,</hi> as
well as <hi>ours,</hi> to undertake for the fulfilling of the
promises. And he hath brought the visible signs
and pledges by which all shall be firmly past and
ratified before your eyes. <hi>This is the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in my Bloud,</hi> Luke 22. 20. Written in my
Bloud: Ratified in my bloud. Oh Sirs, this is
that which God doth here reach forth unto you
with his own hand this day; <hi>The New Testament
in Christs Bloud.</hi> Christians, prepare your Ears;
And rouze up your Faith, and now believe and
hear some of the blessed Articles of that Covenant
that God doth here Sign and Seal to you: I shall
mention onely Nine, which I advise you to lay
next your hearts while you have a day to live.
And you shall find the vertue of these Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64323:43"/>
strong and operative in all conditions.</p>
               <p>Arti. I. <hi>That he will fulfil to you the place of
all Relations</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 18. <hi>I will be a Father to
you, and yee shall be my Sons and Daughters.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Children may expect from a Father, that
you may look for from me: I will find you
Meat, be not thoughtful, <hi>I know that you have
need of all these things,</hi> Matth. 26. 31, 32. You
shall be Clothed out of my Ward-robe, <hi>Matth.</hi>
6. 28, 29, 30. and wear my Livery: And when
you have need of Correction, I will Remember
to do it in mercy, and you shall find, <hi>that as a
man chastneth his Son, so the Lord your God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth
you,</hi> Deut. 8. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will be a Husband to you and will betroth you unto
me for ever,</hi> Hosea. 2. 19. You shall not need to

you my choice Love: I will give you my heart.</p>
               <p>I <hi>will be a Lord and Soveraign to you:</hi> The

The Lord is your <hi>King:</hi> Fear not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
of men; I will judge your cause,
I will defend your Rights, you shall not stand
or fall at mans Bar; you shall not be cast at their
Votes: Let them Curse, I will Bless: Let them
Condemn, I will Justifie: Who shall accuse,
when I shall acquit you? Who shall lay any thing
to your charge, when I do discharge you? When
you come upon trial for your life to have your
eternal state decided, you shall see your Friend,
your Father on the Bench: And you shall surely
stand in judgment, and be found at the right
hand among the sheep and hear the King say,
<hi>Come yee Blessed.</hi>

with you, you shall not want for I will feed you:
you shall not wander to be lost, for I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
you: I will cause you to lie down in
green Pastures, and lead you beside the still
waters: if my Officers be careless, I will do it
my self: As for you O my flock, thus saith
the Lord God, I will judge between Cattel
and Cattel, I will feed my flock, saith the Lord
God, and cause them to lie down. I will seek
that which is lost, and bring again that which
is driven away, and bind up that which is
broken, and strengthen that which is sick; but
I will destroy the Fat, and the strong, and will
feed them with judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will be a Physician to you.</hi> I will heal your
backslidings, and cure all your diseases, fear not,
never did soul miscarry that left it self in my
hands and would but follow my prescriptions.</p>
               <p>Well this is one of the Articles that God
here sealeth to, that he will be to you in the
place of all Relations. Silence thou quarelling
unbelief, methinks I hear thy whispers, that
this is too good to be true, that it were presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in us to count upon all this. What shall
they that must say to corruption, thou art my
father, be able to say to the incorruptible God,
thou art my Father; Shall they that must say
to the worm thou art my mother, and my sister,
be able to say to the Angels of Light, ye are my
fellow Servants? And to the King of Glory,
Thou art my Brother, and my Kinsman? Shall
Majesty espouse himself to misery, and the
worms meat be married to Immortallity and
life, How can these things be?</p>
               <p>Nay but O heart of Infidelity, who art thou
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64323:44"/>
that repliest against God? Dost thou, under a
sly pretence of humility, question with thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and call his Veracity into doubt? Is not this
his Word, his Promise, his Covenant? and
is not here his Seal? why then dost thou doubt
O thou of little Faith?</p>
               <p>Art. II. <hi>That he will entitle you to all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Persons and Perfections,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>I will
be a God unto thee;</hi> mark, God gives away <hi>himself;</hi>
and he gives his <hi>Son</hi> to you, <hi>Isa. 42. 6. I will
give thee for a Covenant of the people.</hi> This is the
Churches triumph, <hi>Isa. 9. 6. unto us a Son is
given.</hi> And he gives his <hi>Spirit</hi> to you, <hi>Iohn</hi>
14. 16. <hi>He shall give you another Comforter.</hi> And
Believers acknowledge the Receipt, 1 <hi>Cor. 2.
12. We have received the Spirit which is of God.</hi>
Thus you see all the <hi>Persons</hi> of the God-head
are made over to you; and so are all the <hi>Perfections</hi>
of the God-head; for so the Covenant runs,
<hi>Gen. 17. 1. I am the All-mighty God, or the All-sufficient
God, walk before me and be upright:</hi> these
are the terms between God and a believer, Be
thou upright before me, and I will be All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to thee: The All-sufficiency of God is the
comprehension of all his <hi>Perfections.</hi> Truth
without Power, or Power without Wisdome,
or both without Goodness, would not be <hi>All-sufficiency:</hi>
All-sufficiency takes in all that is in
God (it we may speak of Gods most simple Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
according to the shallow reach of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
capacity) yea it comprehends infinitely
more then can be said or thought. Why now
this is the Covenant of grace which God esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes
with you this day, that he will be a <hi>God
All-sufficient to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:64323:44"/>Christians rouse up your Faith: Now appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
and apply the Promises: Now believe
strongly, and stedfastly, and believing will fill
you with joy unspeakable, and full of glory. I
do not wonder if your Faith be put to it in so
high and great a mistery; To draw nigh to the
infinite Majesty, and consideringly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hesitancy to say, <hi>Thou art mine and all that
thou hast,</hi> this is no easie thing. But thou
mayst not dare to doubt it. Canst thou question
him who is the Truth? can the strength of <hi>Israel</hi>
lie, or his word deceive thee? But the soul is ready
to reply, oh the thing is too high, and too
great for me to presume to believe, and is ready
with <hi>Peter,</hi> astonied to cry out, <hi>Depart Lord, for
I am a sinful man.</hi> But why doth thine hand
tremble, and thy heart fail thee, and thy feet
(with <hi>Peters</hi> when walking on the waters) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to sink? What doest thou stick at? Is it at
the truth of the Promise? No saith the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
soul, but sure so much can never belong
to me so sinful, I am afraid it is not mine, why,
what saith the Promise? <hi>onely be upright.</hi> What
though thou hast an hundred failings, yet thy
heart is <hi>upright:</hi> the bent of thy heart is <hi>mainly
for God and Holiness;</hi> thou makest conscience of
all sin, little as well as great, secret as well as
open, and doest not deliberately allow thy self in
any: thou doest in the settled frame of thy heart
prefer the pleasing of God, and value his favour,
and fellowship above all worldly good, therefore
thou art <hi>upright,</hi> these marks are infalliable.
What, doest thou object thy failings? Art
thou under a Covenant of <hi>works?</hi> Do you think
God now stands upon Perfection? The
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64323:45"/>
Covenant is plain: God conditions but for <hi>upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and God <hi>hath wrought</hi> in thee the <hi>condition</hi>
that he requirts of thee. What can be plainer?
wilt thou suffer the Devil and unbelief to catch
the Bread out of thy hand, when God tells thee
it is thine? wilt thou be against thy self, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
thine own peace, when God is come to Seal
thee up to the day of Redemption: This is that
which the Lord here Seals to thee, <hi>That he will
be God All-sufficient to thee.</hi> O believe, and be
thankful, and rejoyce in thine own blessedness:
O happy, thrice happy souls, whom the living
God thus Signeth and Sealeth to, and Assignes
over all his infinite Perfections as its everlasting
possession.</p>
               <p>Art. III. <hi>That he will discharge you from all
your Debts.</hi> Heb. 8. 10, 12. <hi>This is the Covenant,
I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
sins and iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> Isa. 1.
18. <hi>Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as
white as Snow.</hi> Believest thou this? Come near
beloved Christian, approach believingly, and here
thou shalt see the Lord Crossing our all
thy Debts, taking away the hand writing that is
against thee, declaring that he hath received a
Ransome and is satisfied, Content, and Paid.
Oh happy man that shall leave all thy sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
thee, why this is the very thing that the
faithful God doth here Seal unto thee. Thy
Pardon is writen in this Sacred bloud, which
is here shed for the remission of sins. So that
thou mayest triumph with the Apostle, <hi>Who is
he that condemneth, it is Christ that died,</hi> Rom.
8. 34.</p>
               <p>Art. IV. <hi>That he will save you from all your
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64323:45"/>
enemies,</hi> not from the <hi>Combate,</hi> but from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi>
The victory shall <hi>be sure,</hi> so far God is
engaged. So the Covenant runs in its first
discovery, That <hi>the Seed of the Woman should
break the Serpents head, though he should bruise
his heel,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. by the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi>
understand not <hi>Christ only,</hi> but <hi>all Believers:</hi>
by the Serpent understand not <hi>Satan only,</hi> but
all <hi>his party,</hi> the ungodly persecuting world,
which are his Children; and all our Tyrannous
Lusts which are his brood, his works. By his
<hi>bruising our heel,</hi> understand his molesting, and
wounding of us, but not mortally. By our <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his head,</hi> understand the total and final
victory which we shall most certainly obtain
over him and all his party at last. Christians,
what should you fear! Death? The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
here Sealed makes over <hi>Death</hi> as a Legacy
to you, and behold it brings you the head of
your conquered enemy in a Charger. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 22. <hi>Death is yours:</hi> O blessed and most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
present. <hi>Satan?</hi> The Covenant assures
you God will <hi>bruise him under your feet shortly,</hi>
Rom. 16. 20. <hi>The World? Be of good chear,
Christ hath overcome the World,</hi> John. 16. 33.
<hi>Hell? There is no Condemnation to them that are
in Christ Iesus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>Sin?</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is to be dreaded, but with a <hi>watchful</hi> and
<hi>cautious</hi> fear: not with a <hi>fainting discouraging</hi> fear:
<hi>sin shall not have dominion over you,</hi> Rom. 6. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Christians, here now is meat for your Faith,
What do all these holy Promises nothing move
you? or carry little savour, or relish with them?
What, shall the All-mighty God give it to
thee under his own hands that thou art a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64323:46"/>
and thou make little account of it? shall
he give thee thy protection, and thou lay it
by as a useless paper that signifies little?
O sirs, when your hearts are ready to faint
because of the Sons of <hi>Anak</hi> that be in the
way, when you see the black guard gaping
upon you, and the King of Terrours levelling
at you, and a wicked World armed with rage
against you, and full of malice, and the theeves
and conspiratours in the bosome watching
their opportunity to betray all to them, yet let not
this discourage you: These were enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to make a considering mans heart to melt,
and die within him, but that the Covenant of
Grace yields such ample releif against all. Oh
be ever mindfull of the Covenant: Remember
what hath past this day between the Living God
and your Souls: Watch O Christian, and
stand fast, quit thee like a man. The Conquest
is sure: Who would not fight with courage
that hath assurance of the Victory.</p>
               <p>Art. V. <hi>That he will befriend you in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
He will be a fast friend to you in every
change, and turn all things to your good, even
when you are ready to say unbelievingly with
<hi>Iacob, All these things are against me,</hi> Rom.
8. 28. Gen. 42. 36. If he brings you into
the Wilderness, <hi>There he will speak comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to you,</hi> Hosea 2. 14. <hi>In the fire, And in
the water he will be with you,</hi> Isaiah 43. 2. <hi>He
will be a strength to the poor, a strength to the
needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm,
and a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the
terrible ones is as a storm against the wall,</hi> Isa. 25. 4.</p>
               <p>Beloved, here the Lord is come to Seal
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64323:46"/>
all these Promises to you: Oh go home and
bless your selves in the sweet security of your
estate. God hath promised you that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
condition you be in, you shall have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
and support from him, and enjoy
his presence with you; and see his Finger
in all your troubles, sweetly turning all to
the best: Go away and live like Believers.
Be not afraid of suffering, but shew that you
believe what God hath promised, that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
shall not hurt you. The next time
any trouble comes upon you, Remember what
a Promise God hath passed unto you this day,
and wait on him believingly for the happy
issue and and event of every triall that shall
befall you.</p>
               <p>Art. VI. <hi>That he will take upon him the
care of all your Concernments.</hi> You must be
<hi>Carefull in nothing,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. <hi>He careth for you,</hi>
1 Pet. 5. 7. <hi>Take no thought what you shall
eat or drink, neither be of doubtful mind,</hi> but
rather <hi>seek you the Kingdome of God, and all
these things shall be added to you,</hi> Luke 12. 29,
31. Come you to this holy Ordinance in
any distress or trouble? Methinks you should
go from it as <hi>Hannah,</hi> and your countenance
be no more sad. God will <hi>number your hairs,</hi>
and will take care that <hi>nothing be lost,</hi> John
6. 39. Luke 12. 7. He will take care of
your <hi>names,</hi> and bring <hi>forth your Righteousness
as the Light,</hi> Psalm 37. 5, 6. of your <hi>subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,</hi>
He will <hi>give meat to them that fear him,
and be ever mindful of his Covenant,</hi> Psalm 111.
5. of your <hi>seed,</hi> for he will be a God unto
them, and will entail the blessing upon them,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64323:47"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. He commands that your Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Fatherless Children should be left
on him. He is by Covenant to look after
their concerns, you need not be solicitous. He
is tender of you when he seems most to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
you, as <hi>Moses</hi> sister that was secretly
watching behind the Bush, and wistly looking
on, to see what was done to the Child,
though to the Finders it seemed exposed to
Famine, and Death in the Flags.</p>
               <p>Art. VII. <hi>That he will give you, or be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to you instead of all Comforts. He will
be a Sun and a sheild, and will give Grace and
Glory, and no good theing will he withold from
them that walk uprightly,</hi> Psalm 84. 11. Oh
the treasure in these words. <hi>I am thy Shield
and exceeding great Reward!</hi> I will undertake
both for thy Protection and Provision: When
any evil assailes thee I will be a Shield to thee:
When any good is wanting I will be a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
Thou shalt have Children, or I will
be better to thee then ten Children. Thou
shalt have <hi>Riches,</hi> or I will be thy Store.
Thou shalt have <hi>Friends</hi> if best for thee, or
else I will be thy <hi>Comforter</hi> in thy solitude,
thy Counsellour in thy distress. My Secrets,
my Ear, and my Door shall be ever open
to thee, <hi>Mark 10. 30. He shall receive an
hundred fold now in this time:</hi> Though he
have not the things themselves, yet he shall
have all these, and more then all in me: I
will be <hi>House,</hi> and <hi>Friend,</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> to him
all in one. If you should have an hundred
Candles burning in a Room, and should put
out every one, and open the window and let
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64323:47"/>
in the Sun, this would be better then the
hundred lights that were put out: So here,
though thou shouldst be called to forsake all,
'twill be but as the letting the Cistern run
and open to thee the Fountain.</p>
               <p>Arti. VIII. <hi>That he will maintain you all
your daies in his service.</hi> He will be your <hi>Guide</hi>
even <hi>unto Death,</hi> Psalm 48. 14. Christans,
whilst you have a day to live, God will
stand by you: <hi>He will never leave you
nor forsake you,</hi> Heb. 13. 5. <hi>Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow you all the daies of your
lives,</hi> Psalm 23. 6. <hi>And the Lord will never
turn away from you to do you good,</hi> Jer. 32. 40.
Oh happy Covenant that the Lord Sealeth
to you.</p>
               <p>Art. IX. <hi>That when you come to Age he will
give the Kingdome to you.</hi> God saith to the
Believer <hi>here: Thine is the Kingdome:</hi> What
ever is promised in the Covenant, is Sealed
in the Sacrament, <hi>Luke 12. 32. It is your
Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom,</hi>
Luke 22. 29. <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdome,</hi>
mark the promise is pregnant with a <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
'Tis no less then a <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that
is here delivered to you, <hi>Luke 19. 12. A
certain noble man went into a far Country to
receive to himself a Kingdome and to return:</hi> This
is the business you are come for hither, <hi>to
receive to your selves a Kingdome</hi> and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
Oh methinks you should forget what
ground you go upon, as you are going home,
to think what you have received here: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
you should go forth as <hi>Haman</hi> from
the Banquet joyful and with a glad heart.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64323:48"/>
Sirs, do you know <hi>what you are doing?</hi> why
the Lord doth by these signs give you <hi>the
Kingdome</hi> as a man by the delivering to you
a <hi>Turf</hi> or a <hi>Key</hi> gives possession of an <hi>House,
or Land.</hi> Brethren, have you ever read of
the <hi>Kingdome of joy,</hi> of the <hi>Crown of life,</hi> of
the <hi>Robes of Righteousness,</hi> of the Thrones of
Glory? Why all this God here makes over
to you: I tell you Sirs, these are not big
words, nor cunningly devised fables. God
All-mighty is here come to certifie you of the
reality of his promises. As sure as you do
now sit on your seats, you shall shortly sit
on your Thrones. As sure as you are now
cloathed with flesh, so surely shall you be cloathed
with Glory. Are you sure that you are now
on Earth? so surely shall you be shortly in Heaven.
The Lord intendeth you but for a very little
while in this lower Region, you must dwell
above; where Christ is, there you must be
also. As sure as you now see a Crucified
Christ, so sure shall you shortly see a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Christ. The Lord Jesus doth antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
his sentence here, and calls to you, Guests,
<hi>Come ye Blessed, inherit the Kingdome.</hi> Take
the writing, behold the Seals, here are the
Conveyances of the Kingdome: The donation
is sure and full, unalterable, irrevocable.</p>
               <p>Christians, do you believe? If you do, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
you should be ravished: methinks you
should be filled with joy unspeakable and full of
Glory! But do you stagger at the promise
through unbelief? Do you sey, oh it is too much,
and too great? why how can that be? What!
too great for God to make good? thou darest
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64323:48"/>
not think so: But it is too great for me to count
upon. Why but man, dost thou not bear upon
thee the <hi>marks of the Lord Iesus; Whose Image
and Superscription is this?</hi> Doth not your very
heart prize Christ above all the world? Hast thou
not made a deliberate choice of him, for thy
Head and Husband? Hast not thou entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a solemn contract with him, to be his for all
times and conditions, and to love, honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
him, before all others to the death? And
doth not thy heart stand to this choice? Hast not
thou taken him with his Yoke, and with his
Cross? And dost not thou in thy practice first
seek the Kingdome of God, and the Righteousness
thereof? And hast not thou chosen the way of
the Kingdome? Art not thou in love with Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and desirest grace more then Gold? Dost not
thou prefer a holy and spiritual life, before all
the grandeur of the world, and pleasure of the
flesh? And all this not only for a fit or a flash,
but in the setled frame and disposition of thy
heart? surely thou must wrong God and thy self,
if thou deniest it to be thus with thee. Why
these are the <hi>marks of the Lord Iesus</hi> upon thee,
the sure marks: fear not, these can not deceive
thee, They evidence that thou art born of God,
that thou art a Son, and so an Heir; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mayest lay claim to the inheritance.</p>
               <p>Come then Beloved Christians be of good
comfort, why shouldst thou doubt? Thou hast
the mark of the sheep, And therefore thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall be at the Right hand, and thy Sentence
among the Blessed. Well then, receive this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament as the pledg of all this. Go home
and look over all these blessed Promises, and count
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64323:49"/>
them thine: Do not read them (as too often
heretofore) as if they did not concern thee: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what God hath here promised under
hand and Seal to thee, and let not all be left
behind thee, when thou goest hence; but let the
remembrance, the fruit and sweet of this, abide
upon thee whilst thou hast a day to live, Never
forget what the Lord hath here spoken to thy
Soul: make more of the Promises then ever in thy
life before: Bless thy self in them: Remember
how the Lord <hi>delivered thee</hi> the Promises: how
he <hi>Sealed</hi> to the several Articles: how he sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the bloud upon the Book of the Covenant and
gave it to thee, and said, <hi>This is the New Testament
in my Bloud:</hi> Oh live henceforth a life of joy, and
Faith, as a man that is elevated above the world.
Do not live at thy old, dull, and slothful rate,
carry it like a Believer, and in a word, walk as
one that doth indeed take all for Truth that the
Lord hath spoken to thee this day. Let that of
the <hi>Apostle</hi> be a close to all, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having
therefore these Promises dearly beloved, let us Cleanse
our selves from all filthiness of flesh, and spirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
Holiness in the fear of God.</hi>
