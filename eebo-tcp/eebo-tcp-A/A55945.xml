            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

theſe.</p>
            <p>After the Information was read, the Kings Council opened the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in queſtion, alledging the heinouſneſs of the Fact, and of what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Conſequence it might prove if it ſhould paſs unpuniſhed, for
that it concerned the Nation in General, and might give Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to greater miſchief if it ſhould be paſſed over, or to that effect;
after which the Evidence for the King was called &amp; ſworn; who depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon Oath, that in the precedent Term at a Tryal between his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> the ſaid Sr. <hi>Patient VVard,</hi> being a Witneſs
for the Defendant did, upon Oath, depoſe that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Pilkinton</hi>
was not preſent at the time the diſcourſe begun in Relation to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs; and that afterwards coming to the Table, in the Matted
Gallery, when he began to ſpeak of burning the City, he the ſaid Sr. <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
VVard</hi> clapped his hand on his Mouth or Breſt, and bid him Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
himſelf; demanding whether he meant not one <hi>Hubert,</hi> that fired
the City, and was for the Fact Executed, and that many words lay'd
in the Declaration, in the Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> were not
ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Pilkinton</hi> to the <hi>Plantif, &amp;c.</hi> To this or the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
Eight or Nine Witneſſes were ſworn, and the matter ſtrongly
argued, and managed by Council. Divers Interrogatories being put &amp;
all doubtful matters amply Explained &amp; lay'd open to the Conſideration
of the Jurors, together with the Heineouſneſs of the ſin of Perjury;
which did not only expoſe mens Fortunes and Reputations, but lives,
to perpetual hazard and danger; the Council likewiſe put them in mind
that the words lay'd in the Declaration were ſworn to by perſons of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54426:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unſpotted Reputation and not only upon the Tryal of Mr. <hi>Pilkington,</hi>
but even again in their hearing, and that they ought to have regard to
the Poſſitive Evidence of Credible Affirmatives, for that they ſwore to
what they had heard and retained in their memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Kings Evidence had depoſed the matter of Fact at large,
as was lay'd in the Information, the Evidence for the Defendant were
called who were many in number, but the chief, one Mr. <hi>Blanie</hi> a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſter,
who took the Tryal between his Royal Highneſs, and Mr. <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ington</hi>
in ſhort-hand Notes, who in Court produced the ſaid Notes,
declaring that he had taken them true as to what they contained, to the
beſt of his Judgment and that he had peruſed them and could
not conceive any Error therein, as to what he had taken, but
withal, declared that he could not be ſo poſſitive, but that he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſome words, not withſtanding he ſat in a place advantageous for his
taking of the ſaid Notes, appealing to thoſe preſent, whether in his take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral Tryals in that Court, and others, he had omitted any thing
material, or falſyfied; againſt which ſome Objections were made. His
Evidence as likewiſe that given by many of the Defendants Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
was that the ſaid Defendant did not; at the Tryal,
between his Royal Highneſs and Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> to their memory
ſware poſſitively to each particular charged againſt him, but
that he depoſed, that as he believed, or to the beſt of his knowledg, or
according to the beſt of his memory, or that he did not hear ſuch and
ſuch words ſpoken; or that he was not poſſitive as to particulars; which was
that which the Council for the King for the moſt part inſiſted on in the Intero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories
or Queries put to the Defendants Evidence, who were not leſs then 12.
or 13. ſo that after the Tryal had laſted for the ſpace of four hours, or thereabouts
and the Witneſſes, with great diliberation, heard what they had to ſay. Firſt the
Kings Council ſummed up, what had been repeated, declaring that the matter
conſiſted of theſe points, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Defendant did ſwear poſitively at the
Tryal between his Royal Highneſs &amp; Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> to ſuch matters, as were ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, or not: for Conformation that he did many worthy Gentlemen had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
it upon Oath, who were preſent at the ſame Tryal: that he only ſwore dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
ſome perſons had depoſed. Therefore if they believed the Kings Evidence
they muſt find him Guilty, according to the Tenure of the Information.</p>
            <p>After which the Council for the Defendant ſummed up the Evidence, &amp; came to
particulars, but above all alledged the Credit and Reputation of the perſon, in
queſtion, arguing that he had born the chiefeſt Office in the City, and other great
Places of Truſt, and that he could propoſe to himſelf no advantage by perjury in
that Caſe neither did he by his giving Evidence perjudice, the Plantif a peny; for
that he had his damages to the full, as they were lay'd in the Declaration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which the Court gave the charge, &amp; as ſoon as the Jury went out, roſe, leaving
them to give a private Verdict to the Puiſne Judge: the matter being try'd
upon an Information at Common Law, Some hours being ſpent in debate as is
conceived, the Jury unanimouſly gave their Verdict that the Defendant was Guilty
of the particulars mentioned in the Information which Virdict on <hi>Munday</hi> laſt was
made Publick.</p>
