         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> so sound &amp; cleere
in proofe, that in my conceit it will doe much good: and

betwixt vs and Papists the chiefest, no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
more disputed, and lesse agreed vpon then this.
Christ and his bloud is the maine cause of our spirituall
peace; Papists and others diuide with him, and take
something to themselues: the spirituall pride that is in
the heart of man, would faine haue a finger in the work
of saluation, of other controuersies betwixt vs &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party: some befor the Popes Kitchin, some for the
Popes crowne, but this of our Iustification, toucheth the
life of Grace to the quicke, breeds more in our flesh then
any, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se sicknesses are most dangerous, that come
from within. It is a fundamentall case, wherein to faile,
takes away the essence of a Christian: Wherefore sith
there is now such need to haue the world confirmed in
this truth of God, I thought good to send this booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
wherein this is put out of question to any man of
a single eie; that we are not iustified by any thing wee
any thing we can doe or suffer.</p>
            <p>Many write bookes, and confute them themselues
when they haue done; but this our Author what hee
wrote, he beleeued; for being to die, he confirmed this
Truth, in a discoursefull of life and power, and professed
<pb facs="tcp:14751:5"/>
to take his last vpon it, that it was the very truth of
God. Wee reade that some learned Papists, when they
are to giue vp the ghost, disclaime their owne merits,
and would faine finde all in Christ alone: but this our
Author did it before sundry, with that life, and feeling,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cleare apprehension of the loue of God in his Sonne,
that such is heard him, and loued him well and long,
could not well tel, whether they should weepe, or reioice;
weepe, to see a friend die, reioyce to see him die so. Good
Reader, learne this holy instruction out of this booke:
that we are not to be found in our owne righteousnes at
all, and beleeue it; thou shalt haue as he had, peace pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all vnderstanding, in life, and in death, for being
iustified by saith (not by workes) we haue peace with
God saith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> If any ingenuous learned Papist
would vndertake to answer this booke, me thinkes I
might prophecy that as <hi>Vergeziꝰ</hi> (Bishop of Capo d' Istria,
and Nuncio to <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth, and <hi>Paul</hi> the
third) reading <hi>Luther,</hi> to answere <hi>Luther,</hi> was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and had his soule saued. And as <hi>Pighius,</hi> tho of a
peeuish Spirit enough, yet reading <hi>Caluin,</hi> to confute
<hi>Caluin,</hi> was in the very doctrine of Iustification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
himselfe, and wrote with vs. So I say, would a
modest Papist read this booke to reply vnto it, he could
not but see the truth, and yeeld vnto it. For tho many
have done excellently in this argument, yet to speake
my opinion freely, at least for perspicuitie, this surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them all. Farewell.</p>

                  <p>1 <hi>Legall</hi> and of <hi>Workes,</hi> which stands in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
vnto Gods law, which is inherent within our selues,
when in our owne persons and workes we possesse and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
that righteousnesse which is required of the Law.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Legall</hi> Iustice is also double,</p>
                  <p>1 Of <hi>Obedience,</hi> when all such things are done, as the
Law commandeth; or left vndone which it forbids. Hee
that doth so is a iust man.</p>
                  <p>2 Of <hi>Punishment</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> when the breach of
the Law is satisfied by enduring the vtmost of such penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as the rigour of the Law required. For not onely hee
who doth what the Law commandeth: but euen he also
that suffereth all such punishments, as the Law-giuer in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
can inflict for the breach of the Law, is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a lust man, and reckoned after such satisfaction made, as
no transgressor of the Law. The reason of this is plaine
from the name of penall Lawes.</p>
                  <p>For first, where the penalty is suffered, there the <hi>will</hi> of
the <hi>Law-giuer</hi> is satisfied; for as much as his will was, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the Law should be obserued, or the punishment
vndergone. If therefore he, to whom the Law is giuen, doe
either: he satisfies the will of the Law-giuer. Had his will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14751:6"/>
beene absolute, so that nothing else could haue contented
him, but onely obedience: then it had beene a vaine thing
to haue prescribed a determinate penalty. But when as a
penalty is limited in case of disobedience, 'tis manifest that
though the intent of the Law-giuer was in the first place
for Obedience; yet, in the next place it should suffice, if there
were satisfaction by bearing of the penalty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the good and benefit of the Law-giuer is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
also satisfied. For it is to be supposed in all penall lawes,
that the penalty limited is euery way proportionable and
equivalent, vnto that good which might accrew by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of the Law. Else were the wisedome of the Law-maker
iustly to be taxed, as giuing an apparant encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to offenders; when they should see the penalty, not
to be so much hurtfull to them; as their disobedience were
gainfull. He therefore that suffers the penalty is afterward
to be reckoned as if he had kept the Law: because by his
suffering, he hath aduanced, the Law-giuers honour, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
as much as he could by his obeying.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Euangelicall,</hi> and of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is such a conformity
to Gods Law as is not inherent in our owne persons; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in another is imputed vnto vs and reckoned ours. The
righteousnesse of the Law, and of the Gospell, are not two
seuerall kindes of righteousnesse; but the same in regard of
the matter and substance thereof: onely they differ in the
Subiect and Manner of application. The righteousnesse of
workes is that holinesse and obedience which is inherent in
our owne persons and performed by our selues: the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of Faith is the same holinesse and obedience inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the person of <hi>Christ</hi> and performed by him; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by our faith, and accepted by God, as done in our
stead, and for our benefit.</p>
                  <p>These are the diuers acceptions of this word Iustice or
Righteousnesse; so farre as it concernes the point in hand.</p>
                  <p>In the next we are to enquire of this word <hi>Iustification;</hi>
which being nothing but the making of a person iust or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14751:7"/>
righteous, may be taken in a double sense. For a person is
made iust either by <hi>Infusion,</hi> or <hi>Apology.</hi> Wee will take it in
these tearmes for want of better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Iustification</hi> by <hi>Infusion,</hi> is then, when the <hi>habituall
quality</hi> of <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Holinesse</hi> is wrought in any
person by any meanes whatsoeuer; whether it bee created
&amp; infused into him by the worke of another; or obtained by
his owne art and industry. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> was made iust. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi>
7. 29. God hauing giuen vnto him in his creation the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
qualities of Iustice and holinesse. Thus also the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
are made Iust, in as much as by the holy Ghost,
they are sanctified through the reall infusion of grace into
their soules; in the which they increase also more and more,
by the vse and exercise of all good meanes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 <hi>Iustification,</hi> by <hi>Apology</hi> is, when a person accused
as an offender is iudicially or otherwise, acquitted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be innocent of the fault: and so free from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
When the innocency of a party accused is thus
pleaded and declared; he is thereby said to bee iustified, or
made iust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according as, on the contrary by Accusation
and Condemnation, a party is said to be made vniust. As 'tis
plaine by that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 5. 23. [<hi>They iustifie the wicked for a
reward: and take away the righteousnesse of the righteous from
him</hi>] that is, they condemne the righteous, which is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them, vnrighteous in the sight &amp; estimation of men.
So in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 10. [<hi>He that beleeueth not God, hath made
him a lyer</hi>] because vnbeleeuers do in their hearts call Gods
truth into question: and accuse him to be false of his word.
So againe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 7. [<hi>When he is iudged, let him be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>]
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Let him goe out a wicked person.</hi> For
so his condemnation makes him (that is) declares him to
be. But here further it must be obserued, that this <hi>Iustification</hi>
of a person, by pleading to, and absolution in Iudgement, is
of two sorts; according as the Persons to be iustified, are
likewise of two seuerall conditions.</p>
                  <p>1 Some are truely and inherently iust, being no Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14751:7"/>
of the Law; either at all; or not in that whereof
they are accused. In this case if any crime, or suspition of
crime, be layed to their charge; they are iustified; either by
a plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e denyall of the fact, alledging that the fault whereof
they are accused, was neuer by them committed; or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the euill of the fact, alledging that in so doing they
haue done well, because they haue done what the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
and thats their warrant. Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> iustifies his
gouernment against all surmise of fraudulent and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
dealing, that the people might imagine by him. In
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. &amp;c. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> cleares himselfe before God,
from that crime of conspiracy against <hi>Saul</hi> his Master, and
seeking of the Kingdome (which <hi>Cush</hi> and other Courtiers
accused him of) professing his innocency; and desiring God
to iudge him according to his righteousnesse and integrity
in that behalfe: as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 3. 4. 8. There need not other
instances in so plaine a matter. Those that are iustified by
this meanes are iustified by that Righteousnesse which is of
the <hi>Law</hi> and of <hi>Workes.</hi> By which plea though man may be
iustified before man: yet in the sight of God no flesh liuing
shall be iustified. As hereafter we shall see.</p>
                  <p>2. Some are not truely righteous in themselues: but are
in their owne persons transgressors of the Law. These (when
they are accused) haue no other meanes whereby they may
be iustified, but by confessing the crime, and pleading <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:</hi>
that for their transgression against the Law, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
thereby against the Law-giuer, they haue fully satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by doing or suffering some such thing, as by way of iust
penalty hath beene required of them. Now hee that can
plead such a full and perfect satisfaction, ought therefore
to be accounted innocent, and free from all desert of further
punishment (for tis supposed he hath endured the vtmost of
euill the Law could inflict:) and so he is to be esteemed of,
as if he had not at all violated the Law. For plenary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for a fault, and the <hi>non-Commission</hi> of such a fault,
are of equall Iustice: and deserue alike Iustification. In
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14751:8"/>
which point, it must be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, that if the party offended doe
pardon without any satisfaction taken, there the offender is
not iustified at all. And againe if the offence be such, as there
can be no satisfaction made: then it is vtterly impossible
that the offender should euer be iustified. Now this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which an offender may plead for his Iustification, is
threefold.</p>
                  <p>1 That which is made by himselfe in his owne person.
He that can plead this kinde of satisfaction, is iustified <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally</hi>
by his owne righteousnesse and merits.</p>
                  <p>2 That which is made by another for him; When
another by consent and approbation of the party offended,
interposeth himselfe as <hi>surety</hi> for the party delinquent, in his
stead and name to make that <hi>satisfaction,</hi> which is required
of the party himselfe. Whether this be done by doing or
suffering the same things which the delinquent should haue
done or suffered, or some other things but of equivalent
worth and dignity. He that pleades this kinde of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is iustified Euangelically by grace, through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of another imputed to him, and accepted for
as his.</p>
                  <p>3 That which is made partly by himselfe and partly by
another. Which kinde of satisfaction may haue place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Man and Man: but betweene God and Man it hath
none at all. Neither by this, nor by that first kinde of <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
which is done in our owne Persons, can any man be
iustified in the sight of God, but onely by the second sort,
that <hi>satisfaction</hi> which is made by another for vs. As wee
shall see afterwards.</p>

the signification of words is to bee ruled, not by Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies:
but by the common vse:—<hi>Quem penes arbitrium est

We answere: That of a Multitude of places of Scripture,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
wherin the word Iustifie is vsed, our Adversaries may truly
pick out one two or three that seem to fauor their Assertion
of <hi>Infusion</hi> of <hi>habituall Iustice:</hi> yet haue they gained little
thereby, For where tenne or more may be alleadged against
one in which the contrary signification is vsed, reason tels
vs, that an Article and Doctrine of Religion ought to bee
framed out of the signification of words and phrases, which
is vsuall, ordinary, and regular; and not out of that which
sometimes comes in by way of particular exception. Might
he not be iudged destitute of sense or modesty, that would

first in Gods decree; then in the Execution of it by
three degrees of <hi>Vocation Iustification and Glorification:</hi> it
followes necessarily from thence; that either <hi>Sanctification</hi>
is left out: or that it is confounded with one of those three
degrees named. Tis a desperate shift to say that <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is signified by <hi>Vocation</hi> or <hi>Glorification:</hi> therefore it must
be the same with <hi>Iustification;</hi> And this cannot be avoyded

him to this place, this plaine direct answere. That <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
is here comprised in the word <hi>Vocation.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the linkes of this golden chaine are inseparable, and all
those that are called must needes be iustified and glorified:
by <hi>vocation,</hi> must here be meant that calling which is inward
and effectuall, not that alone which is outward by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Ministery of the Word. For all that are thus called, bee
not iustified, as is apparent; and againe, some, as Infants,
are iustified that are not capable of such a Calling. But now;
wherein stands the inward <hi>vocation</hi> of a sinner? Is it not in
the Infusion of inherent sanctifying Grace, enlightning his
Eyes, opening his Eare, changing his Heart, turning him
from darkenesse to light, from the power of Satan, to the

Sanctification,</hi> (whereto we are called by the Gospell

                     <hi>The fourth place is that in the Epistle to the</hi> Hebrewes,
Chap. 13. 14. [For if the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the

the blood of Christ, who through the eternall Spirit offered
himselfe without fault to God, purge our consciences from dead

                  <p>Hence they argue; That as Leuiticall Sacrifices and

so the Sacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> doth purge the Conscience
from inward spirituall vncleanenesse of dead Workes or

they must be confounded for one and the same Grace and

that in the Sunne Light and Heate are all one: because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

                  <p>That by this grace of Inherent Righteousnesse, a Man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is in some sort iustified before God. That is so farre as a
Man by the grace of God is become truly holy and good:
so farre God esteemes him holy &amp; good. God taketh notice
of his owne graces in his Children, he approues of them and
giues Testimony of them in case it be needfull; as appeares
by the Righteousnesse of <hi>Iob, Dauid, Zachary</hi> and other
holy Men; who were good and did good in Gods sight.
Yea in the Life to come when (all corruptions being vtterly
done away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the Saints shallbe invested with perfection of
Inherent Holinesse: by the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of their owne,
and not by any other shall they then appeare iust in Gods
fight.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre we agree with them. But herein now wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
differ, that although by the grace of Sanctification infused,
God doe make him righteous and holy in some measure that
was before altogether vnholy and wicked: neuerthelesse
we affirme that by and for this Holynesse, the best of Saints
living never were nor shallbe Iustified in Gods sight; that
is pronounced iust and innocent before the Tribunall of his
Iustice. For we here take vp the forenamed Rule layed
downe by our adversaries, <hi>Whomsoeuer God pronounceth to
be perfectly iust; he must needs be made perfectly iust.</hi> For
Gods Iudgment is according to trueth. Now that no man
in this life, is made perfectly iust by any such inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in him as is able to outstand the severe and exact triall
of Gods Iudgment: is a Trueth witnessed by the Scripture
and confessed alwaies by the most holy Saints of God.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14751:14"/>
Our Aduersaries indeed stiffly pleade the contrary: teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that sinne and Corruption in the Iustified is vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
The error and pride of which Imagination we shall
shortly haue occasion more at Large to Discouer vnto you.
Meane while let that much stand for good: that Man being
not made perfectly iust in himselfe cannot thereby be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
perfectly iust before God: and therefore some other
Righteousnesse, &amp; not that of Sanctification is to be sought
for, whereby a sinner may be Iustified in Gods sight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To that argument of ours from the Opposition of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication

many places of Scripture;<note place="margin">

nothing at all Both may agree to God who of his mercy
iustifies some; (that is) makes them inherently Iust; of his
Iustice condemns other (that is) punisheth them. To which
slight Answeres wee make this short reply. That where
words are opposite, (as they acknowledg these to be) there
according to the Lawes of opposition, they must carry op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Meaning. But vnto Accusation, Comdemnation, and
punishment nothing is opposite but defence, Absolution, and
Pardon. Where therefore <hi>Iustificare</hi> is coupled with these
words; it must needes beare this and no other meaning: of
a bad man to make a good is not opposite to Accusation,
Condemnation, or punishment of him: Accused he may be,
Condemned and punished iustly, and after made good.</p>
                  <p>I should but trouble you to alleadge more of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills.
Let thus much suffice for the clearing of this point:
That Iustification and Sanctification are to be Distinguished
and not confounded. The Righteousnesse of the one is in vs,
in its Nature, true and good: but for its degree and measure,
Imperfect; and alwaies yoaked with the remaynder of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore if a sinner should plead this
before the Iudgment seate of God, (offering himself to be
iudged according to this Righteousnesse and Innocency) oh
how soone his mouth would be stopped; And this confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
wrung out from out his Conscience; All my Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14751:14"/>
is as filthy Raggs! And againe <hi>Vilis sum;</hi> I am
vile, what shall I answere thee! But that other Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Iustification is without vs in Christs possession: but
ours by Gods gratious gift and acceptation, and this
euery way perfect and vnreproued in the seuerest Iudgment
of God. And therefore when a sinner is drawne before the
Barre of Gods Iudgment, accused by the law, Satan, his
Conscience; conuicted by the euidence of the Fact, and to
be now sentenced and deliuered to punishment by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
Iustice of God: In this case he hath to alleadge for
himself the al-sufficient righteousnesse of a Mighty redeemer
who onely had Done and suffered for him that which hee
could neuer doe nor suffer for himselfe. This Plea alone and
no other in the world, can stop vp the Mouth of hell, confute
the accusations of Satan, chase away the Terrors that haunt
a guilty conscience, and appease the infinite Indignation of
an angry Iudge. This alone will procure fauour and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in the presence of that Iudge of the whole world.
This alone brings downe from Heauen into our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that blessed peace, which passeth all vnderstanding;
but of him that hath it. Whereby we rest our selues secure
from feare of Condemnation; being provided of a defence
that will not faile vs, when after death wee shall come into
Iudgment.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Concerning the first at this time. The condition required
in such as shall be partakers of this grace of Iustification is
true faith,<note place="margin">Generall head.</note> wherunto God hath ordinarily annexed this great
priuiledge; That by faith and faith onely, a sinner shall bee
iustified: This the Scriptures witnesse in tearmes as direct
and expresse, as any can be. [<hi>Rom 3. 28. We conclude a man
is iustified by faith without the workes of the Law.</hi>] and <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. 9. [<hi>For we say that faith was imputed vnto Abraham for
righteousnesse.</hi>] and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. [<hi>Then being iustified by faith
we haue peace towards God through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>]
With other the like places. Whence it is agreed vpon on
all sides, that a sinner is iustified by faith: but touching the
manner, how he is said to be iustified by faith, there is much
controuersie and brawle, betweene the Orthodoxe of the
reformed Churches, and their Aduersaries of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Holland;</hi> the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and the <hi>Papists.</hi> The sentence of
the reformed Churches touching this point, consisteth of
two Branches.</p>
                  <p>First, that a sinner is iustified by faith, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
as it is a quality or action; which by it's owne
dignity and merit, deserues at Gods hands Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sinnes; or is by Gods fauourable acceptance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14751:15"/>
taken for the whole and perfect righteousnesse of
the Law, which is otherwise required of a sinner:
but onely in relation vnto the obiect of it, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of Christ; which it imbraceth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
vpon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that a sinner is iustified by faith in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
vnto the Righteousnesse of workes in the
fulfilling of the Law. Whereby now no man can
be iustified.</p>
                  <p>In this relatiue and inclusiue sense doe the Reformed
Churches take this proposition [<hi>A man is iustified by faith.</hi>]
They explaine themselues thus: There are two Couenants
that God hath made with man; By one of which and by no
other meanes in the world, saluation is to be obtained. The
one is the Couenant of workes, The tenor whereof is [<hi>Doe
this and thou shalt liue.</hi>] This Couenant is now vtterly
void, in regard of vs; who through the weaknes of our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
flesh cannot possibly fulfill the condition of Obedience
required therby: and therfore we cannot expect Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; Life by this means. The other is the Couenant of grace
the Tenor whereof is, Beleeue in the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> and thou
shalt be saued. The condition of this couenant is Faith: the
performance whereof differs from the performance of the
condition of that other Couenant. Doe this and Liue is a
compact of pure Iustice wherein wages is giuen by debt, so
that he which doth the worke obeying the Law, may in
strict Iustice for the worke sake claime the wages, eternall
life, vpon iust desert. Beleeue this and liue is a compact of
freest and purest Mercy: wherein the reward of eternall life
is giuen vs in fauour for that which beares not the least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of worth with it: so that he which personnes the
condition cannot yet demand the wages, as due vnto him in
seuerity of Iustice; but onely by the grace of a freer promise,
the fulfilling of which hee may humbly sue for. By which
grand difference betweene these two Couenants clearely
expressed in Scriptures, it appeares manifestly that these
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14751:16"/>
two Propositions. [<hi>A man is iustified by workes,</hi>] [<hi>A man
is iustified by Faith,</hi>] carry meanings vtterly opposite one to
the other. The one is proper and formall: the other Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymicall
and Relatiue. In this Proposition (<hi>A Man is
iustified by workes</hi>) we vnderstand all in proper and precise
termes: That a righteous man who hath kept the law exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in all points, is by and for the dignity and worth of that
his obedience iustified in Gods sight from all blame and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
whatsoeuer; because perfect obedience to the
morall Law in it selfe, for it owne sake deserues the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of Gods seuere Iustice and the reward of Heauen.
But in that other Proposition (<hi>A man is iustified by Faith.</hi>)
We must vnderstand all things relatiuely thus. A sinner is
iustified in the sight of God from all sinne and punishment
by faith (that is) by the obedience of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> beleeued
on; and embraced by a true faith. Which Act of Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a sinner, although it be properly the onely worke of
God, for the onely merit of <hi>Christ:</hi> yet is it rightly ascribed
vnto faith, and it alone, for as much as faith is that mayne
condition of that new Couenant, which as we must perform
if we will be iustified: so by the performance thereof we are
said to obtaine iustification and life. For when God by
grace hath enabled vs to performe the condition of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing;
then doe we beginne to enioy the benefit of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant;
then is the sentence of absolution pronounced in
our consciences; which shall be after confirmed in our
death; and published in the last iudgement. Secondly, our
faith and no other grace directly respects the promises of the
Gospell; accepting what God offers, sealing vnto the truth
thereof by assenting thereto, and imbracing the benefit and
fruit of it vnto it selfe, by relying wholly vpon it. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of that proposition the Reformed Churches do
admit, &amp; none other: reiecting as erronious and contrary to
the Scriptures such glosses as ascribe any thing to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of faith; or make any combination betweene Faith and
Workes, in the point of our Iustification. Amongst which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14751:16"/>
there are three erronious assertions touching mans Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by Faith; which we are briefly to examine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute.</p>
                  <p>1 That faith iustifieth vs [<hi>Per modum Causae efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
&amp; meritoriae</hi>] as a proper efficient and meritorious cause.
Which by it's owne worth and dignity deserues to obtaine
Iustification, Remission of sinnes, and the grace of well-doing.</p>
                  <p>This is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
labours to proue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his 17. <hi>Chap. lib. pr. de Iustificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
where disputing against Iustification by faith alone, hee
tels vs. If we could be perswaded that faith doth Iustifie
[<hi>impetrando, promerendo, &amp; suo modo inchoando Iustificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>]
then we would neuer deny that loue, feare, hope,
and other vertues did iustifie vs as well as faith. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he sets himselfe to prooue that there is in faith it selfe
some efficacy and merit to obtaine and deserue Iustification.
His Arguments are chiely two.</p>

and effectuall causes of Iustification. But if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dare
not thus presse the similitude for feare of being found guilty
of despising the blood of the <hi>New Couenant,</hi> attributing that
to the Merit of Faith which belongs only to the Merit of
<hi>Christ;</hi> he must then giue vs that leaue to distinguish which
he takes to himselfe; and if he fall to his <hi>Qualifications</hi> and

we dare not without horrible sacrilege ascribe the grace of
our Iustification vnto the worke and worth of any thing
whatsoeuer in our selues; but wholy and only to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of Christ. And therefore when the Scriptures
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14751:17"/>
say we are iustified (<hi>by</hi>) Faith; we take not the word (<hi>By</hi>)
in this formall and legall sense; we are iustified by the efficacy
of our Faith, or for the worth of our Faith, according as 'tis
vnderstood in Iustification by workes: but we take it <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely
&amp; Instrumentally:</hi> We are Iustified by Faith (that is)
by the Righteousnesse of Christ, the benefit whereof vnto
our Iustification, we are made partakers of by Faith, as the
only grace which accepts of the promise, and giues vs assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the performance. He that looked to the Brasen
serpent and was cured, might truly be sayd to be healed (by)
his looking on, though this Action was no proper cause
working the cure by any efficacy or dignity of it selfe; but
was only a necessary condition required of them that would
be healed, vpon the obedient observance whereof, God
would shew them favor: so he that looketh on Christ belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in him, may truly be sayed to be saued and Iustified by
Faith, not as for the worth, and by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Gospell, the Righteousnesse of the Law, to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14751:18"/>
of the Gospell, which is no other but the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of Christ. Thus faith is taken, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. Where he
expresly treats of Iustification. But <hi>before Faith came, we were
kept vnder the Law, shut vp vnto the Faith, which should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

exhibition of the Gospell, and the Righteousnesse thereof:
the Church was kept vnder the Ceremoniall Law, as vnder
a <hi>Schoole-master,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 13. 38.</note> directing her vnto Christ, that so [<hi>Wee
might be iustified by Faith.</hi>] that is, not by the Lesson of the
Law, but by <hi>Christ,</hi> typified and figured vnto vs therein.</p>
                  <p>2 Vnto the other Argument prooving the merit of
faith, we reply; That in those places is no ground, at all for
such a conceit. [<hi>Thy Faith hath saued thee,</hi>] saith Christ to
some who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cured both in Body &amp; Soule. But what? was it
by the efficacy and for the word of their faith that this was
done? No: As 'twas vertue went out of Christ that cured
their bodily diseases; and his compassion that mooued him
to it: so 'twas his grace and merits and free loue that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their soules, and brought them pardon of their sinnes in
the sight of GOD: Yet he saith; Their faith saued them,
because by beleeuing in the Sonne of God, they receiued
this fauour, though for their beleeuing they did not deserue
it. God bestowes mercy where he findes faith, not because
faith merits such fauour at his hands: but because he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to disperse his fauours in such an order, as himselfe hath
appointed; and vpon such conditions as hee thinkes good.
To that of the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman: Her great faith could
not claime by desert, that fauour which Christ shewed vnto
her daughter: onely Christ was pleased to honour her faith
by his testimony of it; and to helpe the daughter at the
Mothers entreaty. Christ did it vpon that request of hers
so instant and full of faith; But yet who can say she merited
ought at <hi>CHRISTS</hi> hands by that her faithfull and
instant petition? Her selfe yet liuing would deny it;
and shee doth deny it there, counting her selfe a dogge
vnworthy of the childrens bread, when yet shee beleeued
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14751:18"/>
strongly, and was a child of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
To that of <hi>Abraham</hi> who gaue glory to God, and of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi>
and others, who pleased God by their faith: Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere:
That it is one thing for a man to glorifie and please
God by his Obedience; 'Tis another, by so doing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
ought at his hands. If God in much grace and fauour
accept of the honour and contentment wee are able to doe
him by our Faith and Obedience: It followes not that
therefore we must in iustice merit at his hands. Other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for them there are: but so weakely knit; they fall
in sunder of themselues. Against them we haue to obiect
the Scriptures, that so often say, [<hi>We are iustified</hi>] <hi>gratiâ</hi> and
<hi>gratis;</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> which they respect more
then the Scriptures, which hath defined thus: <hi>Nihil eorum
quae Iustificationem praecedunt, siue fides, siue opera, ipsam Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationis
gratiam promeretur, Sess. 6. Cap.</hi> 8. How then can
they say Faith merits Iustification.</p>
                  <p>Heere our Aduersaries haue two shifts to runne vnto,
whereby they would avoide the absurdity of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>1 That this merit is not from vs: but of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Faith is the gift of Gods grace; and therefore though
we be iustified by merit: yet we are iustified by grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
merit is of grace. 'Tis of grace that our faith merits.</p>
                  <p>This you may be sure, is some of that smoake of the
bottomelesse pit, wherein hell vented out the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and
they their darke Imaginations; all to confound whatsoeuer
is cleare and lightsome in Scripture. Scripture opposeth
these paires; <hi>Grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6.</note> and <hi>Nature, Grace</hi> and <hi>Merit.</hi> As
the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old confounded Nature &amp; Grace, teaching
that we were saued by Grace: yet affirming that we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
saued by Nature, and the naturall strength of free-will.
Which they salued thus. To be saued by Nature, is to be
saued by Grace: for Nature is of Gods grace and giuing.
So these confound Grace and Merit, making a thing Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
because its of Grace. Faith merits because its Gods
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14751:19"/>
gracious gift. Nothing more contradictory. If it be his
gift, how doth it merit, or of whom? Of man it may, of
God it cannot: vnlesse we will senslesly affirme, that the gift
deserues something of the giuer. That he that giues an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound freely, is thereby bound to giue an hundred
more. Had they sayed that faith is good, because of Gods
giuing; that were true, and we may grant them that God is
honoured and pleased with his owne gifts: but that euery
good thing merits, and that we can deserue of God by his
owne gifts, is affirmed without all Reason, or Scriptures;
and will neuer be proued by either.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet another shift.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 Faith merits Iustification [<hi>Non de condigno</hi>] of the
worthinesse of it: but [<hi>de Congruo</hi>] of the fitnesse:<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> that is,
God in Iustice is not bound to bestow Iustification where
there is faith: but yet in fitnesse he ought to doe it. So that
if he doe not iustifie him that beleeues: he is likely to omit
a thing very fit and agreeable. This distinction is a meere
Imposture and collusion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in dealing with it
seemes to haue a dog by the eares, he is loath to loose him:
yet knowes not well how to hold him. If he be vrged
where Scriptures make any the least Intimation of such a
distinction: hee referres you to Divines, that is, Popish
<hi>Schoole-men,</hi> who out of their owne imagination haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it, and in time made it Authenticall. But he stickes in
the mire, when he is to shew what merit of <hi>Condignity</hi> and
merit of <hi>Congruity</hi> is. Merits of Condignity are workes,
to which wages is due of Iustice. What then are merits of
Congruity? Such workes whereto wages is not due by
any Iustice. As for example: He that labours the whole
day in the Vineyard, merits a penny of Condignity: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in Iustice his labour is worth his hire. But he that for
an houres worke, receiues a penny, he deserues it of Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity:
because though his labour be not worth it, yet he was
promised a penny by him that set him on worke: Then
which fond imagination nothing can be more ridiculous,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14751:19"/>
and contrary to common sense. For the merit of any worke
is the proportionablenesse of 'tis worth with the Reward.
Now in reason wherein ariseth this proportion of any work
with that reward? Stands it in the dignity of the worke it
selfe; or in the compact made betweene him that worketh
and him that rewardeth? It is apparant that the worke is
deseruing or not-deseruing according to 'its owne Nature,
not according to a compact made. He that promiseth vnto
one more for a little worke, then to another for a great
deale in the same kinde: doth not by such a compact make
the little labour of the one more deserving then the others
great pains. We must look to the worke, what it is in its own
Nature: &amp; as it is of some worth or no worth, so account it
deseruing or not deseruing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the distinction
they make some merits of Condignity or worthinesse, some
of Congruity, or of fitnesse without worthinesse, they offend
two wayes, grosly against two rules of Reason. First in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
termes not opposite: Worthinesse and fitnesse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same, if you take them in regard of the worke. For
that which deserues a reward worthily, deserues it fitly:
(how else is it worthy of the reward, if the reward be not
fit for it?) and that which deserues it fitly (if it deserues)
it deserues it worthily.</p>
                  <p>2 In distinguishing vpon tearmes that doe not <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire
t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ti.</hi> For Worthinesse agrees to merit onely: but fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
belongs to Compact. So that in plainer English, the
distinction runnes thus. Merits or deserts, are of two sorts.
Some, that are merits and doe deserue because they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a reward: others that are no merits and doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
because they are not worthy of the Reward: but
onely obtaine it, <hi>ex Congruo,</hi> in regard of Compact and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
For this Rule is most certaine, <hi>That a worke which
deserues nothing by its owne worthinesse: can neuer deserue any
thing by compact or promise.</hi> The <hi>Iesuites</hi> are senselesse in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the contrary.</p>
                  <p>If (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) a King promise a Beggar 1000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:14751:20"/>
pounds a yeare, vpon no condition, then indeed the Begger
doth not deserue it. But if vpon condition he shall do some
small matter, as that he shall come to the Court and fetch it,
or bring a Pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of flowers with him, now the Begger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
it: and he may come to the King, and tell him, hee
hath merited his 1000 pounds a yeare. Euery man, but a
<hi>Iesuite,</hi> would say 'twere extreame impudency in a Begger
to make such a demaund, so derogatorily to the Kings gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
bounty. Now can it helpe them to say, That a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
bindes vnto performance, so that God should be vniust
and vntrue, if he should not bestow the reward promised,
although the workes bee not equall to the reward. For
Gods Iustice and Truth in performing his promise, doe not
imply our merit in performing the Condition. We doe not
deserue by our well-doing; because God is iust in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding.
And the reason is manifest; Because God in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the promise, respected meerly the freenesse and bounty
of his owne grace, not the worthinesse of our workes. And
therefore that obligation whereby he hath tyed himselfe to
performance, is founded meerely in his owne Truth: not a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot in our merit. Wherefore when they tell vs, that faith
merits Iustification [<hi>de Congruo</hi>] they intrappe themselues
in a grosse Contradiction; seeing to deserue [<hi>de Congruo</hi>]
is not to deserue at all; but onely to receiue the reward by
meere promise: God hauing promised to iustifie beleeuers.
Thus much touching the first Assertion, that Faith is the
proper Cause of <hi>Iustification,</hi> working it by it owne efficacy
and merits.</p>

(<hi>His faith is imputed for righteousnesse.</hi>] he saith thus. [<hi>Vbiipsa
fides censetur esse Iustitia, ac per hoc non apprehendit fides
iustitiam Christi: sed ipsa fides in Christum est iustitia.</hi>] In
summe, their opinion runnes thus. God in the Legall Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
required the exact obedience of his Commandement:
but now in the Couenant of grace, he requires faith, which in
his gracious estimation stands in stead of that obedience to
the Morall Law, which wee ought to performe. Which
comes to passe by the Merit of Christ; for whose sake God
accounts our imperfect saith to be perfect obedience. This
Assertion we reiect as erronious, and in place thereof we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
this <hi>Proposition.</hi> God doth not iustifie a man by Faith
properly, impuring vnto him faith in Christ for his perfect
obedience to the Law, and therefore accounting him iust
and innocent in his sight. Which we proue by these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>1 We are not Iustified by any worke of our owne. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
beleeving is an Act of our owne: Therefore by the Act
of beleeving we are not Iustified.</p>
                  <p>The Maior is most manifest by the Scriptures, which teach
that we are saued by grace <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 5. [<hi>and therefore not by
the workes of Righteousnesse which we had wrought.] Tit.</hi> 3. 6.
[<hi>For if it be of Works, then were grace no more grace] Ro.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is likewise evident. [<hi>That Faith is a worke of
ours.</hi>] For though <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 29. it bee said, [<hi>This is the
worke of God that ye beleeue in him whom hee hath sent</hi>] yet
will not our adversaries conclude thence, that Faith is Gods
worke within vs, and not our worke by his helpe. For so
should they runne into that absurdity which they would
fasten vpon vs. (<hi>viz.</hi>) That when a Man beleeues, tis not
man beleeues: but God beleeues in him. To beleeue, though
it be done by Gods aide: yet 'tis we that doe it; and the Act
is properly ours. And being so, we conclude, that by it we
are not iustified in Gods sight.</p>
                  <p>Here two Exceptions may be made.</p>
                  <p>1 First that we are not iustified by any worke of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
owne (<hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>) which we our selues doe by our owne strength
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14751:22"/>
without the help of grace: But yet we may be iustified by
some worke which we doe (<hi>viz</hi>) by the aide of Grace; and
such a worke is Faith. Wee answere. This Distinction of
workes done without Grace and workes done by Grace,
was devised by one that had neither Wit nor Grace; being a
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icke to elude the force of such Scriptures as exclude indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
all workes from our Iustification, without distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either of Time when they are done, before or after; or of
the ayde &amp; helpe whereby they are done, whether by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or by Grace. Wherefore it is without all ground in
<hi>Scripture</hi> thus to interpret these Propositions: <hi>A man</hi> is
not iustified by workes (that is) by workes done by worth
of Nature before and without Grace. <hi>A Man</hi> is iustified
by Grace (that is) by workes done by aide of Grace. These
Interpretations are meere forged inventions of froward
Minds, affirmed but not proved: as we shall more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
declare,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 That we are not Iustified by any workes of our own,
(that is) by any works of the Law: but by a worke of the
Gospell such as faith is we may be iustified. <hi>Male res agitur
vbi opus est tot Remedijs (saith Erasmus</hi> in another case.) Tis
a certaine signe of an vntrue opinion when it must be bolste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp with so many distinctions. Nor yet hath this distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any ground in Scripture, or in Reason: for both tell vs
that the workes commamded in the Law, and workes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Gospell are one and the same for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, What worke can be named, that is enioyned vs
in the New Testament, which is not also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded vs in that
summary precept of the Morall Law [<hi>Thou shalt loue the

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rd thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soule and with
all they strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thy
selfe.] Luc. 5. 27. Deut.</hi> 6. 5 What sinne is there against the
Gospell, that is not a transgression of the Law? If the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand Charity, is it any other then that which the Law
commands: If the Gospell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand Faith, doth not the Law
enioine the same? you will say No. It doth not command
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14751:22"/>
Faith in Christ. I answere, yea, it doth: For that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
vs in generall to Beleeue what euer God shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
vnto vs: commands vs also to beleeue in Christ, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone
as God shall make knowne that tis his will we should
beleeue in him. The Gospell discouers vnto vs the Obiect;
the Law commands vs the obedience of beleeuing it.
Wherefore Faith, for the Substance of the Grace and works
done by vs, is a worke of the Law; and so to be Iustified by
the Action of beleeuing, is to be Iustified by workes and by
our owne Righteousnesse, contrary to the Scriptures; and
that <hi>Phil:</hi> 5. 9. (<hi>That I may be found not, &amp;c.</hi> This of the
first <hi>Reason.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of the Law, which is so in deed and truth.
But Faith is not the perfect fulfilling of the Law.
Therefore God doth not account it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or such.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is granted by our adversaries; That Faith is not
the exact Iustice of the Law; such as can stand before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of Gods Iudgments. The Maior must be proued: That
God accounts not that for perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ct Iustice which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
indeed. This appeares by that <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2. [<hi>The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God is according to trueth.</hi>] Where therefore any
thing is not truly good and perfect: there God esteemes it
not so. Here also twilbe excepted.</p>
                  <p>That God some time Iudgeth <hi>Iudicio iustitiae,</hi> according
to exact Iustice; and then he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udgeth nothing perfectly iust,
but that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h hath true perfection of Iustice in it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he iudgeth <hi>iudicio misericord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so he may esteeme a Man perfectly righteous for that
which is not perfect righteousnesse in it selfe; namely for his
Faith.</p>
                  <p>Surely, this is a trimme distinction thus applyed, that
sets Gods Mercy and Truth together by the Eares. As
who would say, When God iudgeth out of Mercy: hee
then doth not iudge according to truth. The Scriptures
doe not acquaint vs with any such mercifull iudgement of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14751:23"/>
God. This they doe acquaint vs with, That God iudgeth
according to mercy, not when he doth pronounce and cleare
a Sinner to be perfectly righteous for that righteousnesse
which is truely imperfect: but when he iudgeth a Sinner to
be righteous for that righteousnesse which is perfect; but is
not his owne. In this Iudgement there is both Truth and
Mercy. Truth, in that he esteemes me perfectly righteous,
for that righteousnesse sake which is euery way perfect:
and mercy, that he accepteth for sinne, that righteousnesse
which is performed for me by Christ my surety; but is not
mine owne. Other mercifull Iudgement of God besides
this, we acknowledge none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 We are not iustified by two righteousnesses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting
in two diuers subiects. But if wee be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the worke of Faith: we shall be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
partly by that righteousnesse which is in vs,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) of Faith: partly by the righteousnesse of
Christ without vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> we are not iustified by Faith properly.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is apparant. The Righteousnesse of Faith is

                     </gap>nherent in vs. and by it we are iustified (say our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.)
The righteousnesse of Christ is inherent in him: and
by it are we iustified, say the Scriptures. [<hi>Being now iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Ro. 5 9. &amp; v.</hi> 19. [<hi>By the obedience of one, many shall be made

there is an errour, and one part must stand out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We cannot
be properly iustified by both, for our own faith and Christs
obedience too: for if we be perfectly iust in Gods sight for
our own Faith, what need the Imputation of <hi>Christs</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to make vs iust? If for Christs righteousnes we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
iustified: how can God accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs perfectly iust for our
faith? <hi>Arminius</hi> and his friends, seeing these things cannot
stand together; haue (according to the good will which
they beare toward the righteousnesse of Christ) kept in our
faith, and thrust out Christs obedience, denying vtterly that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14751:23"/>
it is imputed vnto vs for righteousnesse. But my Brethren
(which I hope make a better choice) seeing it cannot part
with ours: part with our owne righteousnesse, leaning
wholy vpon the righteousnesse of Christ; and seeking for
the comfort of our Iustification in his perfect obedience, and
not in our weake and imperfect saith. These Reasons may

(that is) Christs righteousnesse beleeued on by Faith, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the beleeuer for righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Whereas our Aduersaries say that faith of its owne
dignity and desert, doth not obtaine this fauour of God,
to be esteemed for the perfect righteousnesse of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Law: but this comes to passe onely by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Christ, who hath procured this grace vnto vs, that
God should thus accept of our Faith: wee answere, that
this is affirmed, but 'tis not prooued. They speake a little
more fauourably then the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who make faith of it
selfe to merit Iustification: these will haue it not to merit it;
but to be graciously accepted for righteousnesse. But wee
find not in Scripture any such Doctrine as this, [<hi>Christ
hath merited that wee should bee iustified for our faith,</hi>]
or [<hi>Christ hath merited for our faith, that faith should
be esteemed by God for that perfect Iustice of the Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are iustified in Gods sight.</hi>] These things the Scriptures
teach not: they teach, that Christ is our righteousnesse, and
that we are iustified by his blood and obedience. But that
he hath merited by his obedience, that we should be iustified
by our owne obedience and righteousnesse, is a peruerse as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of men that loue to runne about the bush, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the streight, to runne in crooked and froward wayes.
And it differs little from the like shift of the Disciples of

too; salue it with this tricke. <hi>Christ hath merited that wee
might merit.</hi> But we acknowledge, as no other merit, but
that of Christ; so no other righteousnesse to Iustification,
but his alone. Thus much of the second Assertion.</p>

                  <p>This we also reject as an error, contrary to the Scriptures,
wherby we are taught, That a man is iustified by faith alone.
For opening the truth of which point: you must call to
minde the different acception of the word <hi>Iustifie:</hi> wherein
it is taken by vs, and by our Aduersaries. With them to
<hi>Iustifie</hi> is all one, as to <hi>Sanctifie:</hi> of vnjust and vnholy, to
make inherently iust and holy. With vs to <hi>Iustifie</hi> is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
an offender, quitting him from blame and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
According to these different Acceptions, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
[A man is iustified by faith alone] hath a double
meaning; one thus [A man by faith alone is inherently san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified]
another thus: [A man by faith alone obtaines ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
in Gods Iudgement, from all faultinesse and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This latter meaning onely is true, and tis that onely
which is defended by vs of the Reformed Churches; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that faith onely is the grace of God whereby a sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
the promise, and resting himselfe vpon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of Christ, receiues mercy from God in absoluing
him from the fault and punishment of all his Transgressions:
and to be accounted Righteous for Christs sake. Which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14751:24"/>
gracious priuiledge God hath annexed vnto faith, as vnto
the Condition of the New Covenant, and not vnto Loue,
Hope, Feare, Repentance, or any other grace; For not these,
but Faith onely, respecteth the promise of the Gospell. The
former sense of that Proposition, is false and absurde, <hi>viz.</hi>
[A Man by faith alone is inherently sanctified] nor doe any
of the Reformed deteine such a Construction thereof.
Wherefore when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his Complices dispute
eagerly against Iustification by faith alone, those Arguments
wherewith they suppose to smite through the Truth of our
Assertion, are let flye at a wrong Marke; being all aymed at
this Butte, (<hi>viz</hi>) to proue; That a man is sanctified by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Bellarmines</hi> long discourse; which he maintaines from the

to shew by Scriptures what force each of those
graces haue to Iustifie. But tis not worth-while
to repeate his proofes. Vnto the Argument, wee
answere two things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 That it is framed vpon the errour which puts out of
frame the whole dispute of our Aduersaries, about this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of <hi>Iustification;</hi> namely, that Regeneration and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is all one thing with Iustification; and that to Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
a sinner is nothing but to doe away inherent corruption,
by infusion of inherent righteousnesse. This we haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
by the Scriptures cleared to be false; and therefore
this Argument proouing our Sanctification to be wrought
by other graces as well as by faith, toucheth not the point
of Iustification in the Remission of sinnes, which faith alone
obtaineth through the promise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 Touching these graces which they make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
vnto Iustification, that is to Sanctification: Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
that tis a Philosophicall dreame of such as measure
out the workes of Gods Spirit in mans conuersion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Aristotles Physickes;</hi> and those disputes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
praeuious, or fore-going dispositions, that qualifie the
matter for receiuing of the Forme. We acknowledge, that
in mans Regeneration all graces of the Spirit are not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at once. But as the ioynts and sinewes in the bodily:
so the graces of Sanctification in the spirituall New-birth,
are at first weake and feeble: Which in continuance of time
gather more strength, according to our growth in Christ.
But yet these are true for the substance: though imperfect
in their degrees and measure. There is now true Spirituall
life in such a one which was before dead in sinne: although
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14751:25"/>
there be not the free and able exercise of all the vitall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

these vertues which are by our Aduersarics reckoned onely
as dispositions vnto Regeneration: are, if they be true and

                  <p>Hence we beleeue that these are foule errors (<hi>viz.</hi>) To
teach that a man without grace by the power of his free-wil
may dispose himselfe to his Regeneration, by beleeving in
Christ, fearing and louing of God, hoping of his Mercy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
of his sinnes, resoluing vpon amendment, and all
this with true and sincere affection: or to teach if a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do these things of his owne meere strength and free-will;
yet by the <hi>Spetiall</hi> aide of God inciting and helping him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

That true Faith, and Feare, and Hope, and Loue, and
Repentance, and purpose of Reformation, are Vertues and

of their Conversion, betweene Gods grace and their
owne free-will, and maintained by curious heads, whom
Philosophicall speculations haue transported beyond the
simplicity of diuine Truth. The Scripture speaks otherwise
of these Graces, as of those that belong to such as are not in
the way to be made good, but are made so already. [<hi>Ye are al

                     <hi>this Loue of

as the<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> Apostle speaketh. This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne forced
to grant: yet he puts it off with a distinction [<hi>No man can
loue God perfectly with all his heart, without the Holy Ghost:
but loue him he may imperfectly without the Holy Ghost dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in him, though not without the speciall aide of God.</hi>]
Whereto we answere; 'tis one thing to loue God perfectly,
and another to loue him truely. To loue him perfectly, is to
loue him with all the heart, all the soule, all the minde, &amp; all
the strength: which we grant no man can doe without the
<hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> but we also affirme, that no man did or shall euer
doe it in this life, so long as there is lustfull corruption in him
causing any the least auersion of his soule from God in any
motion thereof. So that if none haue the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14751:27"/>
in them; but such in whom Loue is thus perfected;
he must be confined with the Saints in heauen, and not haue
his dwelling with the faithfull on earth. But if imperfect
Loue of God be also from the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> dwelling in the
hearts of the Godly, who loue God truely in vnfeigned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse
of <hi>heart;</hi> though in much imperfection by reason
of sinne, which diuerts the heart vnto other pleasures: then it
must be knowne of the Iesuite, what he meanes by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Loue. Is it false Loue, such a meere naturall Man may
conceiue vpon generall grounds: That God is good, the
chiefest good, iust, holy, and full of all excellency? He will
not say for shame, this is a true preparatiue vnto <hi>Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Is it true loue, but in its degree imperfect, not so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
so vehement, so hot as coales of <hi>Iuniper:</hi> yet such as
hath some strength and warmth of spirituall affection?
Then we require that these men will draw vs out a line by
the Rule of the Scriptures, and to tell vs how farre the true
Loue of God may come, without the grace of the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> sanctifying the heart: But after tis past such a degree,
then there is required the sanctifying grace of the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> for it. Twill trouble their Mathematickes to describe
vnto vs in what degree of Perfection that Womans loue
was situated, whose example they alleadge for a proofe of
this point out of <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. [<hi>Her sinnes which were many,
are forgiuen her, for she loued much.</hi>] Can <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tell vs
how much this was? that so by that patterne we may know
how farre men goe in the true Loue of God before they bee
at all sanctified by inherent Grace? For such wonders they
would make vs beleeue concerning this penitent Sinner;
that when her soule was full of Faith and Loue to Christ,
her heart full of sorrow, her eyes full of teares for her sinnes;
yet for all that she was a gracelesse, vnholy person, whose
<hi>Loue,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> came not from the sanctifying
grace of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> but onely from free-will helped
with some kinde of externall aide of God.</p>
                  <p>We haue not Faith to beleeue such Mysteries as these.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14751:27"/>
Nor yet in the last place can we conceiue how there should
be true repentance,<note place="margin">Repentance.</note> with a sincere purpose of Reformation
and obedience,<note place="margin">Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> where the Heart is not changed and renued
by the Holy Ghost.<note place="margin">Not of <hi>Ahab</hi> or <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                     </note> That Godly sorrow and Hatred of
sinne should spring out of a gracelesse heart, that so holy a
Resolution of Amendment of Life should be in an vnholy
person; be Assertions so contradictory and iarring: that no
Christian Eare can with patience endure to heare them. We
conclude then touching these dispositions vnto Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that if these Graces be true, they are parts and chiefe
Branches of inherent Righteousnesse. But if they be false
and counterfeit, they are not so much as Preparations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.
So much of this first Argument: wherein yet one of
these 7 dispositions first reckoned vp is omitted (<hi>viz.</hi>) a
Desire of receauing the Sacrament of Baptisme. (that is) A
Man thats baptised in his youth, afterward, before he be
Iustified, must haue a desire to be Rebaptised. For what is
it for one baptised to desire to receaue that Sacrament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?
This conceit is so absured that howeuer <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

                     </gap>t when other graces are absent; as well
as when they are present. For seeing the Vertue
of Iustifing vs depends vpon Faith alone: and
that in this act it receaues no aide from any other
grace; It followeth that it needs not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of
any other grace: as in the law of sense. If the whole
force of Burning proceed onely from Heat: then
where Heat is, though there be no other Qualities
yet there will be burning; yea if Faith only haue
force to Iustifie, it will follow, that it may iustifie
not onely in the absence of other graces: but in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14751:28"/>
presence of the coutrary vices. For as the absence
of other graces doth not hinder: so the presence of
other vices will not hinder Faith one jot in it office
of Iustifying.</p>
                  <p>But twere absurd to affirme, that Faith can Iustifie
without other vertues with other vices—<hi>Ergo,</hi>
The force of Iustifying is not in Faith alone.</p>
                  <p>To this we answere. That this sophisme is fashioned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Block with the former, that to Iustifie and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
are all one. In which sense we confesse the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is vnauoydable. If Faith alone by it owne vertue and
force did sanctifie: then it would effect this not onely in the
absence of other graces; but in the presence of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Corruptions: and the similitude which we bring to
illustrate our assertion, would confirme that of the Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

Aduersaries; thats a very needelesse question indeed. For if
among them many seedes there be some one that hath such
soueraigne vertue; that it alone can cure all diseases, then tis
no Matter whether thou haue many or few, or none at all
of any other sort in thy hand. Thou hast that which by it
owne vertue without other ingredients will worke the Cure
Nor haue we ought to make answere in this case; If, as the
Eye sees, heate warmes, seeds and other simples doe cure by
their owne proper Vertue: so Faith alone by its owne effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
did sanctifie vs. But there is the Errour. Faith works
not in our sanctification or Iustification by any such inward
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14751:28"/>
power &amp; vertue of its own, from whence these effects should
properly follow. For Sanctification Faith, as we haue seene,
is part of that inherent Righteousnesse which the Holy
Ghost hath wrought in the Regenerate: and tis opposed
to the Corruption of our Nature which stands in Infidelity
Faith sanctifies not as a cause, but as a part of insused grace:
and such a part as goes not alone, but accompanied with all
other Graces of Loue, Feare, Zeale, Hope, Repentance, &amp;c.
Inasmuch as Mans regeneration is not the infusion of one;
but of the Habit of all graces. Againe, 'tis not the Vertue
of Faith that iustifies vs; The grace of Iustification is from
God, he workes it: but tis our Faith applies it and makes it
ours. The Act of Iustification is Gods meere worke; but
our Faith onely brings vs the Benefit and Assurance of it.
Iustification is an externall priuiledge which God bestowes
on beleeuers; hauing therein respect onely to their Faith,
which grace onely hath peculiar respect to the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ and the promise in him. Whereby tis manifest
that this argument is vaine. Faith alone is respected in our
Iustification: therefore Faith is or may be alone without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
graces of <hi>Iustification. Bellar:</hi>

we are Iustified by faith, without the workes of the Law.
Such places are these.</hi> Rom. 3. 28. (Therefore we conclude that
a man is iustified by faith, without the workes of the Law.)
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. 3. (If Abraham were iustified by workes, hee hath
whereof to glory: but not before God. For what saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Abraham beleeued God: and it was counted to him for
righteousnesse.) <hi>And vers.</hi> 14. 15. 16. (For if they which are

                  <p>A Man is iustified either by the workes of the Law,

                     </gap>ault with
vs for adding the word [<hi>onely</hi>] in the Conclusion; which
was not in the Praemises. For Reason will teach them, that
where two Tearmes are immediately opposite, if one bee
taken away, the other remaines alone. So that in euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiue
Syllogisme, whose Maior Proposition standeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
two Tearmes immediately opposite: if one be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the Minor, the Conclusion is plainely equivalent to
an exclusiue Proposition. As if we argue thus. Eyther the
wicked are saued: or the godly. But the wicked are not
saued. Thence it followes in exclusiue Tearmes, Therefore
the godly onely are saued. Our Aduersaries cannot deny,
but that the Proposition [A Man is iustified by workes, or
by Faith,] consists of Tearmes immediately opposite. For
else they accuse the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> of want of Logicke, who
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. should conclude falsely, [A man is iusitified by faith
without workes: if he be iustified either by both together, or
else by neither. Seeing then he opposeth Faith a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d workes as
incompatible, and exclude workes from Iustification: wee
conclude infallibly by the Scriptures, That a man is iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by faith alone. This Argument not auoidable by any
sound a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere, puts our aduersaries miserably to their shifts.
Yet rather then yeeld vnto the truth, they fall vnto their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions:
whereby, if twere possible, they would shift off
the force of this Argument. Whereas therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
oppose <hi>Workes</hi> and <hi>Faith:</hi> the [<hi>Law of Workes,</hi>] and
the [<hi>Law of Faith.</hi>] Our [<hi>owne righteousnesse which is of the

of Workes, nor by our owne Righteousnesse which is of the Law,
but that we are iustified by Faith, by the Righteousnesse of God
by Faith.</hi>) Our Aduersaries haue a distinction to salue this

(By workes done, by the strength of Nature wee are
not iustified. By workes done with the helpe of grace wee
are iustified.) This is the distinction: resolue it now into
these tearmes which are more proper, &amp; it runs thus. (A man
is not sanctified by those workes of the Mora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l Law which
he doth without grace: but a man is sanctified by those
workes of the Morall Law he doth by Grace.) Both Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
are squint eyed, and looke quite awry from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
ayme in this dispute touching Iustification. Is it his
intent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. to proue that a sinner destitute of grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made inherently holy, by Morality, or outward
workes of Piety? or thus. That a Sinner cannot attaine to
Sanctification by his owne strength: but he must attaine to
it by the grace of God? Take a suruey of the Chapter, and
follow the Apostles Argumentation. All both <hi>Iewes</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> are vnder sinne, <hi>verse</hi> 9. therefore (<hi>euery mouth must
be stopped</hi>) and none can pleade innocency; (<hi>and all the
world must be guilty before God.</hi>) and so liable to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<hi>verse</hi> 19. What followeth hence now? (<hi>Therefore
by the workes of the Law, shall no flesh be iustified in his sight,
verse.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>How strange were this Conclusion, taken in our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
Construction. <hi>Ergo,</hi> By Obedience vnto the Morall
Law done without grace no flesh can attaine Sanctification
in his sight. For neither doth the Apostle speake of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but of absolution as is apparant; All are sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law, <hi>Ergo,</hi> by pleading innocency in the keeping
of the Law, no Man can be wholy sanctified nor Iustified
nor absolued from Blame in Gods sight. Nor yet will the
Reason immediately annexed admit that glosse [<hi>Workes
without Grace] By the workes of the Law shall no flesh be
Iustified in his sight.</hi> Why] <hi>For by the Law commeth the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Sinne</hi>] that is, <hi>By the Law Men are conuinced of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14751:32"/>
Sinne, and declared not to be innocent.</hi> Which reason is not
worth a Rush, according to our Aduersaries Construction.
He that without grace shall doe the workes of the Law: he
is not thereby made holy. Why? Because the Law is
the knowledge of sinne. The Law thus obserued tels him
he is a sinner. In which reason there is no force, vnlesse it bee
true on the other side. He that by the helpe of grace doth
the workes of the Law, is thereby sanctified: because the
Law thus kept tels him he is not a sinner, which is most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.
In as much, as not onely those which are destitute of
grace; but those that haue grace also, and by the helpe
thereof, keepe the Law in some measure, are by the Law not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
convinced to be sinners. The Apostle yet goes
forward. (<hi>If we be not iustified by the workes of the Law, by
what then?</hi> He answeres, (<hi>verse</hi> 21.) <hi>But now is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of God made manifest without the Law.</hi>) We are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the righteousnesse of God: But what is that? It
is (saith the distinction) that obedience to the Law which
we performe by Gods grace. A glosse apparantly false. For
the righteousnesse of God here is a Righteousnesse without
the Law: But obedience to the Law, though performed
with grace, is a Righteousnesse (<hi>with</hi>) the Law; because tis
the Righteousnesse of the Law. For tis all one, he that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes
the Law by his owne strength; if he doe it<note n="d" place="margin">As Adam.</note> perfectly
he hath the righteousnes of the law, &amp; he that obeyethit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
by Gods grace, hath still the same righteousnes of the
law, and no other. For so the Law be kept, it alters not the
righteousnes thereof, that we keepe it by our own strength,
that wee haue of our selues, or another helpe that giues vs
strength to doe it. For then that strength which he giues vs
is our owne. Which point duely obserued cuts in sunder
the sinewes of this distinction; for tis cleare the Apostle
distinguisheth the Righteousnesse of the Law and of God
as different in thir kindes: these make them to be one and the

2 The Iesuits are mistaken in the scope of the Apostle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. whose intent is not to shew the <hi>Iew or Gentile</hi> could
not attaine Sanctification without Gods grace; by such O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Law; as they could performe through the
meere strength of Naturall Abilities. They affirme it strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but their Proofes are weake, being manyfestly confuted
by the whole File of the Apostles disputation, who clearely
and plainely exclude both Iewes and Gentiles, from being
Iustified by the workes of the Law without making menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or giueing the least Intimation, by what meanes these
workes must be performed, whether without grace or by
the Helpe of grace. Yea it had been quite besides his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
so to haue done. For the Apostles argument is cleare
as the Light; and strong as a threefold cord. All are Sinners
against the Law, therefore by obedience vnto the Law, (Let
Men performe which way they list or can, without grace or
with grace) no Man is in Gods sight pronounced inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 To the Last argument out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. we answere,
The Apostle there proues: that the Faithfull, children of
<hi>Abraham;</hi> are not iustified by workes. Because <hi>Abraham</hi>
the Father of the Faithfull was Iustified by Faith; and
not by workes. Where wee affirme; That the Apostle
excludeth all the workes of <hi>Abraham</hi> from his Iustification:
both such as he performed when he had no grace, and those
he did when he had grace. For those workes are excluded
wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> might glory before Men. Now <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
might glory before Men as well in those workes which
he did by the helpe of Gods grace: as those which he did
without it. Nay more in those: then in these. As in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
Departure from his owne Country at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
his patient expectation of the promises; his ready
willingnesse euen to offer his owne Sonne out of Loue and
Duty to God, his religious and Iust demeaning of himselfe
in all places of his abode. In those things <hi>Abraham</hi> had
cause to glory before Men, much more, then in such works
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14751:33"/>
as he performed before his Conuertion: when he serued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gods beyond the Flood. Therefore we conclude that
<hi>Abraham</hi> was Iustified; neither by such workes; as went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Faith and grace in him: nor yet by such as followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This is most cleare by the <hi>v.</hi> 2. [<hi>If Abraham where
iustified by workes, he had wherein to glory: but not with God.</hi>]
Admit here the Popish Interpretation: and this speach of the
Apostles will be false. Thus [<hi>If Abraham were iustified by
workes] that is by such workes</hi> as he performed without
Gods gratious helpe [<hi>he hath wherein to glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] viz.</hi> before
Men: but [<hi>not with God.</hi>] Nay, thats quite otherwise. For
its euident. If a Man be Iustified by obeying the Law
through his own strength: he may boldly glory before God,
as well as before Men; seing in that case he is not beholding
to God for his helpe. But according to our doctrine, the
Meaning of the Apostle is perspicuous. <hi>Abraham</hi> might
glory before Men in those excellent workes of piety, which
he performed after his <hi>vocation:</hi> and in mens sight he might
be iustified by them. But he could not glory in them before
God: nor yet be iustified by them in his sight. So then all
workes whatsoeuer are excluded from <hi>Abrahams Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
and nothing lest but Faith, which is imputed vnto him
for Righteousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sse; as it is <hi>v.</hi> 3. Whence it followes. That
as <hi>Abraham:</hi> so all others are Iustified without all Merit, by
Gods free grace and fauour. For so it followes, <hi>verse</hi> 4. 5.
[<hi>Now vnto him that worketh, the wages is not counted by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour;

reply: That 1 This glose is a plaine corruption of the Text.
For by workes in this fourth <hi>verse</hi> the Apostle vnderstands
that kind of workes were of mention is made <hi>v</hi> 2 By
which <hi>Abraham</hi> was not Iustified: and these as we haue

of Gods grace is iustified, by fauour not by debt</hi>] we say tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a manifest falshood or at best, an ambiguous speech.
For tis one thing to bestow Grace on a Man to fulfill the
Law: and tis another thing to Iustifie him; when he hath
fulfilled the Law. If God should giue strength to a Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
to fulfill the Morral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Law, pleading that in euery point he had
done what was required God is bound in Iustice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
him innocent, and of due Debt to bestow on him the
wages of eternall Life. <hi>Adams</hi> case is not vnlike to such
a Man. For God gaue <hi>Adam</hi> what strength he had: yet
<hi>Adam</hi> fulfilling the Law by that strength, should haue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
Iustification and Life. Therefore when the Apostle
speake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

it. But, for asmuch as many exceptions are taken, and shifts

                  <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> of this Argument is framed vpon another

                  <p>The Righteousnesse required by the Morall Law

                  <p>Further this <hi>actuall</hi> righteousnesse of the Law is to bee

                     <item>1 As it respects all the Commandements, and so that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
righteousnesse is onely perfect, which fulfils all and euery
particular precept of the Law.</item>
                     <item>2 As it respects any one Commandement, or any one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

Shall we say this contention lasts but for a while after a

gets an absolute victory, corruption being not only ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastered;

                     <item>3 Sinne is compared to <hi>sicknesses,</hi> diseases, &amp; wounds.
Now God is the best Phisition, the most skilfull
Chirurgian: and where he vndertakes the Cure, he
doth his worke throughly: he cures all diseases
and each on perfectly. He doth not spread on a
sick Man a faire Couerlid, or couer a festred wound
with a faire cloth, as <hi>Caluin</hi> imagines: but by a
purgatiue potion he expelles the disease, by a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
plaister he cures the wound. So that there is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14751:40"/>
not left, nor corrupt matter, nor dangerous sore,
that can proue deadly according to that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.
(<hi>There is no condemnation to those that are in Christ
Iesus.</hi>) that is. There is no matter at all for which
they deserue Condemnation, as those expound.</item>
                     <item>4 Sinne is likned to death, nay it is the <hi>spirituall Death</hi>
of the Soule. Now he that is iustified is restored to
<hi>Spirituall Life,</hi> and where Life is there death is
quite taken away, seing a Man cannot be aliue and
dead both together. Wherefore the Apostle saith
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. [<hi>Our old Man is</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>Hence they conclude.</p>
                  <p>If the filthinesse of sinne be washed away, the Chaines of
sinne broken, the Diseases and hurts of Sinne healed, the
Death of Sinne abolished: then it followes, that Sinne is
quite exstinguished, and remaines no more in those that are
iustified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 They argue thus. If Sinne remaine in those that are
iustified and be onely couered: then God either knowes of
the sinne or knowes it not. To say he were ignorant of it
were <hi>blasphemy (all</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 4. 14</note> 
                     <hi>things being naked and bare before his
eyes.</hi>) If he know it, then either he hates it or he hats it not.
If he doth not hate it how doth the Scriptures say true that
he is a (<hi>God that hateth Iniquity.</hi>) If he do hate it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he must punish it: God cannot see a fault and hate a fault
but he must also punish it to. If he punish it, then he which is
iustified shall yet be condemned which is absurd.</p>
                  <p>Vnto these <hi>Arguments</hi> we answere. Vnto the two former
thus. When we say <hi>Sin</hi> remaines in a Man regenerate and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
we must distinguish the ambiguity of the word <hi>Sin.</hi>
In <hi>Sin,</hi> to vse that distinction which is authenticall with ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Aduersaries; There are three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 <hi>The offence of God,</hi> which is the fault.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:14751:40"/>
2 <hi>The obligation vnto eternall punishment,</hi> which
is the guilt.</item>
                     <item>3 <hi>The staine or pollution of the soule, (viz) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
vitious inclination of it vnto euill.</hi> From
whence the fault committed first issued, and which
by committing of the fault is augmented. For euill
once committed leaues a further pronnesse in the
heart to doe it againe. This we call the <hi>corruption
of Sinne.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Thus then we answer. <hi>Sin</hi> doth not remaine in those that
are iustified, &amp; regenerate in the two first respects, <hi>viz. of the
fault and the guilt,</hi> both which are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by the death of
<hi>Christ.</hi> But <hi>Sin</hi> doth remain in the regenerate according to
the 3 respect, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>vitious quality and corruption</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
inherent in the soule: We shall explaine these answeres,
and apply them to the <hi>Arguments.</hi> We say then; That the
<hi>fault</hi> &amp; <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>sinne</hi> in the <hi>regenerate,</hi> is vtterly abolished by
the death of Christ. Which we doe not take in such a sense
as this. That in a man regenerate there is not at all any one
fault or guilt to be found, for to say that a man regenerate,
when he sinnes, were neither faulty nor guilty, were a grosse
vntruth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> seeing tis impossible that man should sinne, yet
God not be offended; that man should sinne, and yet not
be guilty, and deseruing eternall death. Wherefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that in the <hi>holiest</hi> of men, if they sinne, there's a true
fault, and God is displeased with it; there is also true guilt,
and for it they deserue to goe to Hell. But yet this truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
must be acknowledged withall, that all faultinesse and
guiltinesse are quite abolished and taken away from them
by Christ, because that both are pardoned vnto them. God
is offended; but yet they feele not the wofull effects of his
indignation: because in Christ hee is graciously contented
to be reconciled with them. Againe they haue deserued
euerlasting death: but they come not to the paines thereof,
because freed from the punishment by Christs satisfaction.
Thus then we vnderstand the first part of the answere. That
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14751:41"/>
the fault and guilt of sinne is vtterly abolished, that is, total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pardoned vnto the Regenerate, by meanes of Christ, so
that no finall eternall punishment shall befall them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The other part. That Sinne (<hi>in the uitious quality and
corruption if it remaine in Men iustified</hi>) we vnderstand
with this necessary<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6. 12. 14.</note> Limitation, That it remaines in them
not in its power and strength: but in its Being and Life.
It hath <hi>vitam:</hi> but not <hi>Regnum.</hi> It reignes where there is no
Grace at all: but it liues euen where Grace is. which
though it mightily a bate to power of it: it cannot vtterly
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stroy its being. Hence now its easy to vnty the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Sinne is taken away, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>otted out, drowned in the
bottome of the Sea, in regare of those mischieuous effects
which sinne would haue brough on vs: God is reconciled,
the obligation, to punishment cancelled; and all the power,
force, &amp; strength of Sin defeated; So that like the dead Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
they can no longer pursue the <hi>Israelites</hi> to annoy them,
not shall stand vp as an aduersary in iudgment to condemne
vs. The <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sinne is washed away totall by the blood
of Christ: the filthynesse of corrupted Nature is in part by
Degrees clensed by the <hi>Spirite of Christ</hi> powred on vs in his
sanctifieing Grace. The Fetters and bonds of Sinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we were held in bondage vnder condemnation, these are
quite broken asunder: but those chaines, whereby with
<hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7 (<hi>we are led captiue</hi>) to disobedience are some
broken, all weakened. We are freed from the power of <hi>Satan</hi>
and feare of Hell: but not wholly freed from Sinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are often captiues against our will. Sinne is a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and God is the Phisitian; a wound, and God is the
Chirurgian, true: but the cures neither perectly, yet correct
that word. He cures our sicknesse and sores perfectly: but
not suddainely, where he begines the worke he will finish
it: but he will not doe all in a day. The cure begins and
goes onward to perfection during this life: but tis neuer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
till after death. <hi>He forgiues</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 103. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>all our iniquity</hi> and thats

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14751:41"/>
but this is by degrees, not all at once. In which course
God hath no cause to feare the censure of a Iesuite for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulnesse
nor stands he in need of Mans counsaile, for
prescription, nor Mans helpe to hold his hand in working,
if the Cure goe on more slowly then our foolish hastinesse
thinkes fit. Thats fit and best what God thinkes so: and
if we count him faithfull and wise in his art; tis our duty
to take his aduice: but saucy persumption to giue him any.
Lastly, where Sinne is said to be the (<hi>Spirituall Death of
the Soule</hi>) and so Life being restored in Iustification Death
must needes be quite abolished: the weaknesse of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appeares streight, if the <hi>metaphoricall</hi> terme be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in to <hi>proper.</hi> The death of Sinne is either the Separation
of all grace from the Soule, or the Separation of Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
from the Soule. We are dead in trespasses and Sinnes
both waies: In regard that in the state of vnregeneration
the Soule is vtterly destitute of all Grace and goodnesse:
and also be cause in that condition it is liable to eternall
Death. Now the Death of Sinne that is eternall death in
the perpetuall Losse of Gods fauour this is cleane taken a
way from him that's regenerate. Christ by his death hath
purchased to him Life and immortality. But touching that
other; (death (that is) the want of all inherent Grace in
the Soule) They say. That in Regeneration Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse
is restored to the Soule, yet not so perfectly as to
abolish euery degree of Sinnefull Corruption. Before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
the Soule had no grace atall and so was vtterly
dead but it followes not, That therefore in Regeneration,
it hath all grace giuen it in all perfection, and so made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
aliue: what euer harshnesse there is in the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore,
the plaine termes in this case are smooth enough.
A Man may be at once a liue and dead, that is, at once a
Man may bee partly holy, and partly sinnefull. [<hi>Our old
Man is crucified with Christ</hi> vpon whose Crosse it receaued
a deadly wound; (because Christ by his sacrifice hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the sending of the <hi>Holy ghost</hi> into the hearts of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14751:42"/>
Elect; who by sanctifying them, abolished their naturall
corruptions by degrees. [<hi>That so the body of sinne might be
destroyed.</hi>] that is, not presently annihilated: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> made
of no force and strength, made vnable to worke strongly in
vs. [<hi>That henceforth we might not serue sinne.</hi>] Though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
we should haue sinne in vs. So are we [<hi>dead to sinne</hi>]
not as if sinne were vtterly dead in vs; or had no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in vs, then it hath in a dead carcase: but because the
guilt of sinne is fully taken away, and the power of sinne
hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> receiued a deadly wound, doth bleed out some of its

                     </gap>bly bleed out the last drop of its
life hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Vnto the third Argument, we answere thus, That the
Hornes of those <hi>Dilemma's</hi> be made of wood, and may be
easily battered. We say then that God sees and knowes the
sinfull corruption which is in the regenerate; for wee cannot
assent vnto that wilde and franticke imagination of some;
who haue troubled the quiet of some places in this Land, by
preaching that God doth not, nay cannot see any iniquity or
matter of blame, in those that be in Christ Iesus. We beleeue
that nothing is hid from his eyes: nor be our sins lesse visible
to him then our graces. God knowes what sinnes his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
commit, he iudgeth them to be faults, and such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
his infinite wrath. Yea, to goe further, as hee sees the
sinne of the regenerate: so he hates it with a perfect hatred;
it being impossible, that his pure eyes should behold impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and loue it. But now what followes hence? If he see it
and hate it, then he cannot but punish it. True, that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is certaine. But whats next? If God punish that
sinne which is in the Regenerate how then is their sinne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
and their iniquities forgiuen? How doth hee account
them Iust, whom he knoweth and punisheth for vniust?
Here's a <hi>Sophisme.</hi> He sees sinne, and hates sinne, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
sinne of the Regenerate: Therefore he punisheth it in,
and vpon their owne persons. Thats a <hi>non sequitur.</hi> Hee
punisheth it, but tis in the person of Christ [<hi>who hath troden
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14751:42"/>
the Winepresse,</hi>] of the fierce wrath of God conceiued against
all sinfulnesse whatsoeuer in his <hi>Elect:</hi> by which meanes
his hatred towards the sinne of the Regenerate, is fully
satisfied, and also his loue towards their persons procured.
He graciously passeth by their iniquity, pardoning vnto
them what he hates, and hath punished in Christ: in which
respect he may be truly said not to see that sinne in them
which he will neuer punish in them, and to couer that sinne
which shall neuer bee layed open in iudgement against
them.</p>

But if this suffice not; we haue expresse Scriptures to proue
that no man doth actually obey the Law in all points. Such

                  <p>Whence we conclude, that [<hi>de facto</hi>] neuer any man did
keepe the Law: but brake it in some, yea, in many things.
And therefore we say that the dispute of our Aduersaries,
touching the possibility of keeping the Law, vanishes to
nothing. For seeing no man hath, or will euer actually keep
it (as the Scriptures witnesse) to what end serues all the
quarrelling a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

man shall be iustified by the Law, because he hath a power
to keepe it if he list: but because he hath actually kept it.
Whence it is manifest that the reply of our Aduersaries is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14751:43"/>
ridiculous. No man indeed doth keepe it: but yet they may
if they will. For 1. what is that to Iustification? Can a man
thats regenerate be iustified by his obedience of the Law,
when yet after his regeneration hee doth not keepe it?
2. And againe. How know these men that there was, or is,
such a power in the Saints to keepe the Law, when yet the
world neuer saw it brought into Act? Is it not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that what neuer was nor will be done, neuer could
nor can be done? Were they all idle, and did not doe their
best endeauour? Tis true, none doth so much good as hee
should and might; but yet tis a sharpe censure to say that
none would put themselues forward to the vtmost of their
might. What shall be said of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12.)

<hi>Paul</hi> was able to beare all afflictions patiently, to

We conclude that the actuall Obedience of the morall Law
in fulfilling all the commandements exactly, is impossible
to a regenerate Man in this Life. Let vs now take a short

to the twelfth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> Where the

and is still accomplished in the regenerate, who being san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
and purified from sinne (a worke of Gods Spirit in the
heart figured by externall circumcision of the flesh) should loue
God with all their hearts.</p>
                  <p>2 By example of Dauid, who saith of himselfe, Psal. 1 9.
10. With my whole heart haue I sought thee; and God also te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
of him: That he kept his commandements, and followed
him with all his heart, to doe that onely which was righteous in
his eyes, 1 Kings 14. 8. The like is recorded of Iosiah, 2 Kings

turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soule, and
with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>3 By reason; For to loue God with all the heart, carries
one of these three senses. First, to loue him onely, and nothing
else, and so wee are not commanded to loue God with all our
heart, because we must loue our neighbour too. 2 To loue him
<hi>tanto conatu, quanto fieri potest; (that is)</hi> as much as
may be. Nor is this commanded (<hi>saith</hi> Becanus) and yet if it

were, who would say twere impossible to loue God as much as one
can. 3 To loue God aboue all (that is) to preferre him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all creatures, before father and mother, as Christ did, Mat.
10. 37. and as Abraham did; before his onely Sonne. Now
this onely is to loue God with all the heart, and this, men may
doe, as appeareth in the Martyres and others, who left all for
Gods loue.</p>

                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed makes a (But) at it. There is nothing
required (saith he) of vs: But to loue God with all the
Heart. As if it were as easily done, as spoken. But wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that in this (<hi>But</hi>) God hath set vp a white, which all
the men in the world, may and must aime at: but none will

the performance whereof wee must endeauour syncerely,
chough we cannot doe it perfectly. For the examples of
<hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who are said to follow the Lord with all

intent and endeauour in the generall to establish and

whose many sinnes recorded in the Scriptures witnesse

reformation of all, according to <hi>Moses</hi> Law. Wherefore
the Text saith, that there was no King before him like vnto
him, which cannot be meant absolutely of all, (for <hi>Dauid</hi>
is said to follow Gods will with all his heart; as well as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah:</hi>)
but since the time that <hi>Religion</hi> began to bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> there was none of all the Kings
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that was so faithfull as <hi>Iosiah,</hi> to restore all things
to their first purity. Whence he hath the praise, that he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto God more entirely, then any other King before or
after him. But now from <hi>Iosiahs</hi> zeale in reformation to
conclude, that in euery particular of his life he kept the Law
perfectly, louing God with all his heart; is a consequence,
that wants strength of connexion.</p>
                  <p>Vnto the reason from the meaning of the Law, we grant.
That the first is not the meaning of it. But for the second,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>That to loue God with all the heart, is to loue him as
much as may be.</hi> The <hi>Iesuite</hi> hath no reason either to deny,
that this is not commaunded; or to affirme that if it were
commanded, tis yet possible to doe it. Would any man say;
except he care not what he say, that God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
vs to loue him as much as may be? Or will it bee a
truth from any mans tongue, to say, that he loues God with
as great perfection as may be? It cannot. Which appeares
thus. Gods will is, that we should loue him with all our
hearts. Now Christ hath taught vs to pray. <hi>Thy will bee
done in earth as it is in Heauen.</hi> Thence tis euident, Wee on
Earth are bound to fulfill the Commandement of louing
God: as the Saints in Heauen doe fulfill it. But now our
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14751:47"/>
Aduersaries themselues grant, that whil'st wee bee [<hi>in viâ</hi>]
wee cannot loue God so much as we shall dee [<hi>in Patriâ</hi>]
Whence it followes, that no man can loue him so much as
may be, and as he ought to doe: seeing no man hath his
heart replenished with that measure of Diuine loue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
his Nature is capable, which either <hi>Adam</hi> had in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oncency;
or the Saints haue in glory.</p>
                  <p>Touching the third sense of the words, we grant indeed;
that to <hi>Loue God with all the heart,</hi> is to <hi>loue him super om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
that is aboue all Creatures. But the <hi>Iesuites</hi> take here
but one part of true loue of God. Tis a singular part of
Diuine loue, when the heart is so fixed on God: that neither
the loue nor feare of any earthly thing can draw it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
of God. Which we say, is a matter wherein euery
one failes in some kinde or other, more or lesse, though in the
end may Martyrs and other holy men, haue herein by faith
ouercome the world. But this is not enough vnto perfect
loue, to preferre God before all Temporall paines and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
profits or discommodities. He loues God with all
his heart, not onely who loues him aboue all, but also obeies
God in all. <hi>This is the loue of God, that we keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi>
He that for Gods loue will not obey Gods
Law: he loues his sinnes more then God. Offend but in
the least thing, there's presently want of loue: for hee that
will not doe as God bids him then, is voyde of that loue
which moues him to obey at other times. <hi>He then that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
Gods word, in him is the loue of God perfect indeed.—

And therefore this Commandement [Loue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

                  <p>2 That a man may loue his neighbour as himselfe. For

that loueth another hath fulfilled the Law. Because
the Law is comprehended in this saying, Thou shalt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14751:47"/>
loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, v. 9. and loue doth not
euill to his neighbour: therefore is loue the fulfilling of
the Law, vers. 10. And they bid vs looke Gal. 5. 14.
<hi>Where we reade,</hi> For all the Law is fulfilled in one
Word: Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thyselfe.</p>
                  <p>Hereto we answere. That there's in these places, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that needs answering. We grant, that the loue of our
neighbour as of our selues, is the fulfilling of the Law; that
is, of the second Table of the Law, touching our duty vnto
man, and so much these places witnesse, commanding vs also
so to doe. But now how doe our Aduersaries prooue out
of these places, that men can perfectly ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Law. We yeeld the <hi>Regenerate</hi> loue their neighboars as
themselues: but that <hi>perfection of loue,</hi> which in euery point
fulfils the Law, doing our neighbour no hurt, but all good,
in all our thoughts words and deeds; this we cannot grant
them, vnlesse vpon better proofes. Let vs goe to the tenth
Commandement, which they say may be kept, that is,</p>
                  <p>3 Thou shalt not couet. This tenth Commandement of
the Decalogue, is (say they) possible to be fulfilled by a
Regenerate man. For three things must be obserued,
touching this concupiscence or coueting forbidden in
the tenth Commandement.</p>

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:14751:48"/>
The two former, the vitious disposition of Nature, and
the inordinate desires that goe before consent: these
be no sinnes <hi>(say the Romanists)</hi> and so not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the tenne Commandements. The last (viz.)
Euill desires with consent, they be the very sins which
are forbidden in that Commandement; Whence they
conclude that a Regenerate man may auoid the breach
of this commandment; seeing it is in the power of his
will, whether he will consent vnto such motions of the
heart or no: and if he doe not consent: then, hee sinnes
not.</p>
                  <p>Herevnto wee answere. That whereas they of <hi>Rome</hi>
teach, that the <hi>Habituall vitiousnesse</hi> of Nature and the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
motions</hi> of the Heart which goe before Consent, are
no Sinnes: they therein erre grossily against Scriptures and
sound <hi>Reason.</hi> This the gift of these Men alwayes to iudge
flatteringly and fauourably on Natures side: they concipt
to themselues a God in Heauen like their God in <hi>Rome,
Facilem Deum,</hi> one that will wincke at small faults, and
graunt <hi>Indulgence</hi> by the Dozen. Looke what they iudge
a small Matter God must be of there mind: or else they are
not pleased. His Loue must fit there Humors; what they
thinke they can doe; that God shall haue leaue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or forbid: but if otherwise they'le tell him to his face,
that he is a foole ct a Tyrant, to command them that, which
now they cannot performe. For God (say they) to require
of a Man a freedome from all <hi>vitious Inclinations</hi> and euill
desires, this were as mad an injunction, as for a master to
command his seruant neuer to be hungry, or thirsty, hot or
cold, and to threaten him, that hee should looke through
a halter, in case it bee otherwise with him. This errour wee
shall more conueniently speake of in the refutation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and generall exceptions, which they make against
all those proofes, that doe demonstrate the impossibility
of keeping the Law, whereof this is one, that Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

whereas they affirme that it is in a Regenerate Mans power
not to yeeld consent to the motions of Sin, and that therefore

this couetous mind shews it selfe. Nay, 'tis plaine he
loued not his Neighbour, so well as his riches. He is neither
so dutifull to God; nor charitable to the poore: as for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their sakes, to part with his possessions. But, might
he say, what? will not ordinary almes, or a little more then
ordinary serue the turne? Must I giue away all. Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ede
the Law requires that I be mercifull to the poore: but
wheres any Law that bids me sell my whole estate and
distribute to them that want? Christ layes an vnnecessary
burden vpon me; if I cannot be perfect without vndo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing
my selfe, I will content my selfe as I am, and not seke after
such perfection. Heere a Papist will say he speake reason,
seeing Christs speech was but acounsaile of more perfection,
then the Law required. Now a Man is not to be blamed
if he chuse only to be as perfect as the Law commands him,
and so this young man was: if you'le beleeue him or them.
But the Scripture makes it plaine that he did euill in diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
Christ; and, that if he had obeyed him in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
he had done no more then the Law required at his
hands. For obedience to euery speciall Commandment is
included in the generall. The Law indefinitely commands
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14751:49"/>
vs to giue almes: now if God by a speciall commandment
limite how much we shall giue; whether halfe, or all our
Estates, to obey such a perticular precept is not to do more
then the generall Law requires vs. Such a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
was this of Christ vnto the young Man, wherein
he sets him a spell, according to that conceit of perfection
which he had of himselfe: putting him to the practise of the
highest duty which the Law of Liberality can possible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of a Man (<hi>viz.</hi>) to part with all. This he ought to
haue done vpon Christs particular commandment; in not
doing of it he brake the Law, and proclaimed his heart
to be full of couetousnesse, deuoide of faith in God; and
true Charity towards his Neighbour. From this place then
our aduersaries cannot proue, that this young Man might
haue doen more then the Law required: or that wee are
bound at any time to doe as Christ bid him. Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was for his particular Triall: not for our Imitation.
They that take it otherwise be a generation of men that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
Beggery; and possesse Kingdomes, who were willing
enough to part with that little they had of there owne, that
so they may liue the more <hi>Largely</hi> and <hi>plentifully</hi> vpon other
Mens. Wee goe forward to the next argument.</p>
                  <p>4 If the Law were impossible to be kept it were no Law:
for there is no Law of things impossible. Yea God
were more cruel and foolish then any Tyrant, too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
vs to doe that which is impossible for vs to
doe.</p>
                  <p>To this wee answere, That the consequences were true
if God had giuen a Law which Men neuer had strength to
performe. But now the Law written in tables on Mount
<hi>Sina,</hi> was but a reuiuing and repetion of the same Law,
which was written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart; the Characters whereof
were now defaced in his sinnefull Posterity. <hi>Adam</hi> had
strength sufficient to fulfill it: which as he receaued for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and vs; so he lost it for both. Neuerthelesse though
Strength to obey be lost: yet the obligation to Obedience
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14751:50"/>
remaines. We are no more discharged of our duties, because
we haue no strength to doe it: then a debter is quitted of his
Bands because he wants money to make payment. Nor is
this cruelty or folly in God, that when he published this
Law vnto the <hi>Isralites,</hi> he did not qualifie the exactnesse
thereof, fitting the precepts to there abilities, commanding
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do iust as much as they could or would do. Had God
made a Law in that sort in fauour of mans sinfull nature:
they might with better reason haue layd folly to his charge,
for bending the rule to the crokednesse of mans heart; and
not leuelling it according to the streightnesse of the Rule.
God was to set forth a Law of Liberty, that should not
flatter but freely rebuke Man of all vnrighteousnesse;<note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 1. 25. Psal. 197.</note> a
perfect, Law containing in it a full description of <hi>Holynesse</hi>
and <hi>Iustice,</hi> which Man ought to haue and performe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and his Neighbour: &amp; in this case God had iust
reason to haue respect vnto mans duty; not his ability,
which once he had; but now had forfited and lost.</p>
                  <p>The next Argument is.</p>
                  <p>5 Euery Prayer made in Faith according to Gods
will is heard and granted.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fulfill the Law perfectly. (For we pray that we may
doe Gods will in Earth, as it is in Heauen.)</p>
                  <p>Ergo God heares vs, and giues vs such grace that we
can doci.</p>
                  <p>Hereto we answere. That this prayer shewes vs what
we are bound too; and what is our duty continually to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
That we may doe Gods will euery day more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
cheerefully and constantly, then other. And so farre
God heares the faithfull prayers of his louing children, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
them to better performance, the longer they liue.
But that such perfection of Obedience is giuen to vs in this
life; as the Saints enioy in Heauen, will not be graunted by
our Aduersaries themselues. Wherefore they must also grant
that that Prayer is heard and granted vs by degrees. In this

[<hi>If yee he led by the spirit ye are not vnder Law</hi>] How is that?
Are not the <hi>Regenerate</hi> vnder the Law, that is vnder the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

that Grace frees vs not from subiection and obedience vnto
Gods Law. How then are they not vnder the Law. Tis
plaine. They are not vnder the Curse and Condemnation
of the Law, as those be that walke in the flesh and doe the
workes thereof, who therefore [shall not <hi>inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

walke in the <hi>Spirit</hi> being regenerate and Iustified, are not
vnder the Curse: and therefore though the Law may and
doth accuse them of Sinne: yet the Law is not so against
them, as to bring condemnation vpon them (as it doth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other) from which in Christ they are freed. If the clause
be vnder stood of the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit, there reckoned vp
the sense is this. Against such workes there is no Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
them, as there is against works of the flesh: these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
those contrary to the law. But this makes nothing

to our Adversaries purpose. For the place in <hi>Iohn [He that is

onely a possibility to keepe the Law: but also an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
at any time to breake it. But they easily see how absurd
this position is, and that it being graunted their doctrine of
falling away from Grace lies flat in the dust; seeing <hi>Iohn</hi>
sayeth expresly. <hi>That a man regenerate,</hi> not onely, <hi>doth not,</hi>
but <hi>cannot Sinne.</hi> Therefore certainely he cannot fall from
Grace. Wherefore they helpe it out with a distinction. Hee
cannot sinne, that is, <hi>mortally.</hi> He may sinne, that is, <hi>venially,</hi>
and <hi>veniall sinnes</hi> may stand with grace and with perfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of the Law. This distinction is one of the rotten
pillars of the <hi>Romish Church;</hi> tw'ill come in fit place to be
examined hereafter: for the present, we say, Hee that Sinnes
<hi>venially</hi> (as they mince it.) breakes the Law; and againe
a Man <hi>Regenerate</hi> may sinne <hi>mortally;</hi> which is true not
onely according to there doctrine who teach that a Man
may fall from the Grace of <hi>Regeneration</hi> which to doe is a
<hi>mortall Sinne:</hi> but much more according to the Scriptures
and Experience which witnesse that <hi>Peter, Dauid, Solomon,</hi>
and Many, yea all the Saints, haue at sometime or other there
greivous falls; out of which notwithstanding, by the
Grace of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> abiding in them they recouer
themselues so that finally they fall not a way.</p>
                  <p>The last Argument is from the examples of such men as
haue fulfilled the Law.</p>

<hi>Mat. 5. 48. Be ye therfore perfect, euen as your Father in

of grace, which God bestowes diuersly on diuers
men, according to his owne pleasure, and their greater or
lesse diligence in the practise of <hi>Holinesse.</hi> So that compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely
some men may be said to be perfect, because farre
more perfect then others, as the greatest starres bee said to
be of perfect light, because they shine brighter then those of

goes so farre, as for <hi>inward Holinesse</hi> and <hi>outward

the third Imperfection of mans Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in fulfilling of the Morall Law. We haue seene. That
no man hath perfect inherent <hi>sanctity</hi> free from Natures
corruption. Againe, That no man can performe perfect
actuall obedience to all and euery duty of the Law without
failing in any one point. And this much our Aduersaries
will not much sticke to yeeld vnto vs, and confesse. That
there is no man, but sinneth at some time or other; and that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14751:52"/>
tis scarce possible to avoide <hi>veniall sinnes,</hi> as they stile them.
But then they deny vtterly. That a man sinnes in euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
good worke; though he cannot doe all perfectly, yet
in some he may exactly fulfill the <hi>Righteousnesse of the Law,</hi>
not missing in any one circumstance. And therfore at least by
that obedience he may be iustified. This opinion of theirs
hath neither truth in it selfe: nor yet brings any benefit at all
to their maine purpose in prouing Iustification by workes.
For to what end serueth it them to stand quarrelling for the
perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our obedience in some one or two good works;
when yet we faile in many things besides? One thing well
done will not iustifie him that doth many things ill. For
that of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> must be a Truth: <hi>Hee that keepeth the
whole Law, and yet faileth in one point, is guilty of all. Iames</hi> 2.
10. Much more guilty is he, that keepeth it in a few: and
breakes it in many. But yet further, we reiect this opinion
also, as an Errour: and we teach on the contrary. That</p>
                  <p>No man in this life can performe any one particular
good worke, so exactly, that in euery point, it shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere

                  <p>About this Assertion our Aduersaries raise much stirre
and many soule slaunders against vs, proclaiming vs to all
the world, open enemies to all good workes, that wee bee
Factors for the Kingdome of darknes, promoting as much as
in vs lyeth all licentiousnesse in evill courses, and taking of
the courage and endeauour of Men after pious duties. For
who will set himselfe (say they) to doe any good worke if
the Protestants doctrine be true, that in doing of it he shall
commit a mortall Sinne? who wil pray, fast, and giues almes,
if when he doth these things he cannot but sinne? As good
then it were to doe euill as to doe good: a man can but sin,
and so he shall, let him doe his best. These slanderous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities
fastened on vs, spring not out of our Doctrine
rightly vnderstood: but out of froward and peruerse hearts,
that will not see the truth. Such aspersions will easily bee
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14751:53"/>
wiped of, when after the confirmation of the Trueth wee
shall make answere to such obiections, as seeme to infringe
it. We say then. That no man can performe any good worke
required in the Law with such exact observation of every
circumstance: that (were it examined by the rigour of the
Law and Gods Iustice) no fault at all can bee found in it.
This we proue by <hi>Conscience,</hi> by <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by <hi>Reason.</hi>

good workes; that thou hastnot committed any Sinne at

appeare in Gods Iudgment? Darest thou abide the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this examination standing ready to Iustifie thy selfe

liuing vpon earth that shall in serious consideration of the
seuerity of Gods iudgement, and the great infirmity of his
owne Nature, compare his own obedience with the seuerity
of Gods Iustice, but his heart will presently shrinke within
him, and his conscience shunne this tryall; as much as euer

See, this holy Saint, who elsewhere stands peremptorily to
the defence of his Innocency and vprightnesse against that
wrongfull imputation of hypocrisie which his friends char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him withall, telling them that till he die, he wil not take
away his innocency from himselfe, nor his heart shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
him of his dayes: yet when he sets himselfe before the
Tribunall of Gods Iustice, he dares not stand out in his own
Iustification, but submits himselfe to the mercy of his Iudge,
with humble supplication for his fauour. These confessions
of <hi>Iob</hi> be not complements out of a fained and needlesse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty:
but the fruits of a conscience rightly informed and
apprehensiue of its owne sinfulnesse, and the seuere rigour
of Gods iudgment. The serious meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
we commend vnto our Aduersaries, and all other
of their humour; that are apt to entertaine fauourable and
gentle opinions touching their sinnes: and withall to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
high conceits of their owne goodnesse. Whence they
grow by degrees to thinke, that Gods iudgement is like
their owne foolish imaginations; and where they out of
blindnesse or selfe-loue cannot see a fault: that there God
himselfe can finde none. We hardly see beames in our own
eyes: are we then so skilfull to spie the smallest moate? who
can vnderstand his faults (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) wilt thou answere

Here then humility would doe well, and prayer
for thy ignorances, for thy secret sinnes; vnknowne to thy
selfe as much as others. Here true modesty would haue her
place, that thou preferre Gods wisedome and iudgement
aboue thine owne, remembring that he iudgeth not as man
iudgeth: but sometimes otherwise then thou doest, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

which a Man cannot liue, and though they be small faults:
yet would it be no Iustice in God to punish them. So that
the meaning is, [<hi>Lord enter not into Iudgement,</hi>] that is,
Lord <hi>I will not contend with thee I confesse my selfe a sinner and

other Men doe, amongst whome, there is none so iust but

such faults to my charge. Men of corrupt conscience that

                     </gap>tis manifest, that these were such sinnes, as for them
<hi>Dauid</hi> durst not venter his best workes to come vnto the
Barre of Gods seuere Iudgement. There is yet another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise.</p>
                  <p>That thirdly <hi>Dauid</hi> speakes by comparison. (<hi>viz.</hi>) That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that though the Righteousnesse of his workes were true,
being absolutely considered: yet being compared with
Gods Righteousnesse, it seemed to be <hi>vnrighteousnesse.</hi> As
a candle set in the Sunne, seemes to haue no light: and a little
light compared to a greater, seemes darkenesse. Whereto
we answere that <hi>Dauid</hi> here makes a confession of his owne
sinfulnesse; not a comparison of his owne righteousnesse,
with the righteousnesse of God. He desires that God will
not enter into iudgement with him; not because he had not
so much righteousnesse as God, in comparison of whom it
seemed little or nothing: but because he was sinnefull, and
had not so much <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> as he should. Man may
haue a <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of his owne; infinite degrees, below
the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of God, which yet may passe the Tryall
of Gods Iudgement without all reproofe. As is manifest
in the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> Humanity: both
which, though inferiour to Gods <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> were yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to endure that strict examination. Wherefore wee are
not accounted vniust for that imperfection, because we haue
lesse <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> then our Maker: but because wee haue
not so much as we ought to haue, according to the capacity
of our Nature wherein hee made vs. But of this more
hereafter. Let this serue for the clearing of this first place
of Scripture, and the exceptions against it.</p>
                  <p>The second place of Scripture, is that, <hi>Isa. 64. 6. But wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
are all as an vncleane thing, and all our righteousnesse is as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Church of God, submitting herselfe to him in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14751:56"/>
of her sinnes, and the iustnesse of his anger against
her. The confession is euery way generall: both for <hi>Persons,</hi>
not one excluded; <hi>We all</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

from the tree, and is driuen away with the winde; <hi>And wee

sinfulnesse in all his most righteous workes, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
diuers wayes.</p>
                  <p>1 That the <hi>Prophet</hi> speakes here in the person, not of
the godly: but of wicked, who make here this confession of
their sinnes. And how proued they this? Thus. The Text
saith. <hi>Behold thou art wrath, for wee haue sinned.</hi> Now
God is not angry with the godly: but with the wicked. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the Text saith, <hi>There is none that calleth vpon thy name.</hi>
That is, None of the wicked persons, for the godly doe call
on Gods Name. This exception is manifestly refuted by
the whole order of the Text, whereby it is apparent to any
that hath but halfe an eye, that this Recognition of Sinne,
and prayer for mercy beginning at the 15 <hi>verse</hi> of the 63.
<hi>chapter,</hi> to the end of the 64 <hi>chapter,</hi> is made by the whole
Church, and all the faithfull therein, confessing their owne
faults, as well as others, and suing for reliefe, not onely in
behalfe of others, but of themselues too. His reasons are
worth nothing. God is not angry with the godly, saith
<hi>Bellarmine.</hi> No? Then <hi>Peter</hi> is in an errour, who saith,
1 <hi>Pet. 4. 17. 18. The time is come that iudgement must begin
at the house of God; and if it begin at vs, what shall the end of
them be that obey not the Gospell of God; And if the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
be scarsly saued; where shall the vngodly and sinner appeare?</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:14751:56"/>
Here's Iudgement on Gods house, that is, on the righteous,
that obey the Gospell, as well as on the vngodly that obey
it not. And so tis, when the godly sinne, they smart for it, in
priuate afflictions, in publique calamities, both wayes they
finde God is not well pleased with their ill doings. When a
Church and a State is ruinated, may not the most righteous
take vp this confession. <hi>Lord thou art angry for we haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
Euen we by our sinnes haue hastened and increased the
publique miseries? I trow, none will deny it. Againe, the
Text speakes of those that doe not call vpon Gods Name.
But the godly call vpon it, <hi>Ergo.</hi> tis not meant of them. True,
they doe call vpon Gods Name: but is this done alwayes
with that diligence, with that zeale which God requires?
How comes it to passe then, that the godliest men are many
times secure, slothfull, cold and carelesse in the duties of
Gods most holy worship? Yea, in the corrupt and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
times of the Church this happily is their fault chiefly,
who themselues begin to freeze in so generall a coldnesse of
the season, loosing much of that seruency of Spirit which
the Apostle requires of vs, as at all times: so then especially,
when it should reuiue and put heat into others, when their
loue of Religion begins to waxe cold. At such times zeale
in Gods seruice, vehemency in prayer, constancy in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exercises, resolute, but discreet forwardnesse in the holy
profession of Religion is most commendable. But yet it so
comes to passe, that euen then much security and slackenesse
ouercomes the godly, and whilest they should be a meanes
to preuent a mischiefe, they hasten it vpon themselues and
others.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Iewish Church here in this place confesseth,
that there were none that called on the name of the Lord, a
carelesse negligence, and slacknesse in the Seruice of God, was
come vpon them, so that as it is in the next words, [<hi>there
was none that stirreth vp himselfe</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>to
take hold of God.</hi>] None awaked and rouzed vp himselfe with
diligent endeauour to apply himselfe to the worship of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14751:57"/>
God, A fault wherewith God may iustly be angry: as hee
then was. This first exception then is friuolous. Others
there bee as idle.</p>
                  <p>2 That by (<hi>all</hi>) in this place is to be meant the <hi>greatest
part;</hi> not all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor all their works were sinfull; but the
<hi>greatest part.</hi> For so the word [<hi>All</hi>] is taken in some places
of Scripture: and therefore the <hi>Iesuits</hi> thinke, it must needs
be taken so here.</p>
                  <p>3 That if it be meant of (<hi>all</hi>) simply: yet tis not to bee
vnderstood at all Times. All the <hi>People</hi> and their workes
were nought and sinnefull, when they were to be caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Captiue: but it followes not, that they were so at other
times.</p>
                  <p>4 This must be restrained to the righteousnesse which
consistes in Obedience to the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law. [<hi>All our
Righteousnesse</hi>] that is, <hi>all our Ceremoniall workes in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
Obseruations of Sabboaths, New-moones, Fasts and
such like, [are as filthy clouts</hi>] being done in that manner as
wee doe them (<hi>viz</hi>) without <hi>Faith and Obedience.</hi> To
these we say. That there would neuer be an end, were a
Man bound punctually to refute euery Cauill, which an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary
may frame out of his fancy-full imagination, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heart. We owe the Romanists no such credit: as to
assent to any point of <hi>Religion</hi> vpon their bare affirmation.
We can as confidently deny such Exceptions as these, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
yeelding them a refutation: as they doe boldly make
them without bringing any proofe. And certainely most
vaine and vngodly is that course which our Aduersaries or
any that tread in there steps doe hold in their Disputations,
about serious points of <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine: when being vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with conuincing <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they thinke they haue done
the part of <hi>Schollers,</hi> and satisfied the <hi>Consciences</hi> of others
desirous of Truth, if they can amuse and stonny you a little
with two or three <hi>Interpretations</hi> and prety exceptions,
and so leaue you to chuse which you list. They will not tell
you which they will stand to: but euen when there answers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14751:57"/>
crosse one another, yet all shall downe, that if one helpe not,
another may, and altogether may vexe you, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
satisfie you. This quarrelsome humour of men, who
seeke not the truth in loue: but write to maintaine, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
is not the least vexation of the spirit, and wearinesse to
the flesh of man; as all those will witnesse, whose much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath led them along into the perplexed mazes of
<hi>Schoole-learning,</hi> whether <hi>Diuine</hi> or <hi>humane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third place of Scripture is, <hi>Psal 130. 3. If thou, Lord
shouldest marke iniquities, O Lord who shall stand?</hi> This place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is parallell to the former, wherein the holy <hi>Prophet</hi> desires
God to be attentiue to the voice of his supplications, craues
this audience meerely of Gods fauour; not vpon any righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
or worth of his own. As for that he confesseth. That if
<hi>God should be strict to obserue</hi> wherein hee and all men doe
amisse: neither himselfe, nor any other could be able to stand
in his presence. Whence he flies from his Iustice vnto his
mercy. <hi>But there is forgiuenesse with thee that thou mayest
be feared. verse</hi> 4. Presumption then it is, and arrogant
pride for any <hi>Romanist</hi> to say. Lord if thou doe obserue
Iniquities: yet I shall be able to stand. In such and such
good workes, be extreame to marke what is done amisse;
I feare not the tryall, nor will sue to thy mercy.</p>
                  <p>From Scriptures we come to Reason. Which is thus.</p>
                  <p>Wheresoeuer there is <hi>concupiscence</hi> and inordinate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the heart; wheresoeuer there's a defect of Charity

the <hi>best workes</hi> of men are not free from some corruptions
and sinfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>But in a man <hi>Regenerate</hi> there is <hi>concupiscence</hi> and
euill motions of the heart present with him, when hee
would doe good; there is a want of that measure of loue

Psal 7. 8. Iudge me, O Lord according to my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and according to mine integrity that is in me.
And after all this, Psal. 18. 23. 24. He professeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
his innocency, and reward for it. I was, saith he,
also vpright before him, and I kept my selfe from mine
iniquity. Therefore hath the Lord recompensed mee
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14751:58"/>
according to my righteousnesse, according to the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my hands in his sight. And Psal. 17. vers 3.
Hee declares how GOD had throughly tryed him:
and yet found him faultlesse. Thou hast proued mine
heart, thou hast visited me in the night, thou hast try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, and yet shalt find nothing: I am purposed my

say that Iob and Dauid sinned mortally in their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and doings: when God himselfe witnesseth for
them that they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e not sinne?</p>
                  <p>Hereto we answere. That we doe not lay <hi>sinne</hi> vnto the
charge of those holy men: nor doe we say they did ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where
the Scriptures witnesse they did well. <hi>Iob</hi> in that first Act
of his tryall quitted himselfe well, and ouercame the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
He sinned not as afterwards he did, breaking forth
into impatiency: and that is all the Scripture meant by that
speech; <hi>In all this Iob sinned not.</hi> But whether <hi>Iobs</hi> patience
were in this first conflict euery way so vnreproueable, that
not the least fault could be spied in it, in Gods seuere Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is more then we dare affirme, or our Aduersaries will
euer be able to proue. For <hi>Dauid;</hi> his innocent demeanor
of himselfe, in the time of <hi>Sauls</hi> raigne was such: that no
Imputation of vnfaithfulnesse or ambition could iustly bee
layed to his charge. Wherefore when <hi>Sauls</hi> followers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him of treason against their Master: <hi>Dauid</hi> appeales
vnto God desiring him to deale with him according to his
Innocency in that behalfe. His owne conscience, and God
with his conscience, after tryall made, acquit him from plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and practising against <hi>Saul,</hi> as his Aduersaries said hee
did. Thence it followes that <hi>Dauid</hi> did not offend in that
kind whereof his Aduersaries accused him. His heart was
vpright; his life was innocent; neither his Aduersares could
make proofe, neither did his conscience accuse him, or God
condemne him of these faults, that he was charged withall.
Thus farre <hi>Dauid</hi> durst stand to Gods Iudgement; that hee
was innocent in those particular euils, whereof man had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14751:59"/>
him: but it followes not therefore hee durst enter
into iudgement with God; and plead, that God himselfe
could find no fault at all with him. Hee might haue many
secret faults and imperfections euen in this most innocent
passage of his life; which neither himselfe knew, nor his
enemies could come to the knowledge of: and therefore
though he dare pleade his righteousnesse before God, so
farre as man can accuse him of vnrighteousnesse, yet he dare
not goe further to cleare himselfe against all that God may
obiect against him. Heare what himselfe saith in this case,
<hi>Psal. 139. 23. 24. Search me, O God and know my heart, try
me and know my thoughts.</hi> Speakes the Prophet this out of
confidence, that God vpon search and tryall, shall finde no
euill in his heart and thoughts? No, but out of holy desire,
that whatsoeuer euill is found in him may bee amended.
Hee knowes well that many things may be found faulty in
him: and therefore he stands not to iustifie himselfe: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sues for grace to redresse them; adding in the next words.
<hi>And see if there be any wicked way in mee; and lead mee in the
way euerlasting.</hi>

they had neither faith &amp; sanctity from whence they sprung;
nor the glory of God, at which they aimed. Now as the
vertues of the naturall man, are in part vitious: so the <hi>good
workes</hi> of the <hi>Regenerate</hi> are in part sinnefull. To fast, to
pray, to giue almes, with the like workes of <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
we affirme and teach that they are <hi>good workes,</hi> good in
their nature and vse: being such actions as the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
We know none of our side so farre gone with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as to maintaine that a godly man sinnes, because hee
fasts, prayes, and giues almes; as if those very acts were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but damnable sinne. We detest such franticke opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and if any of our Writers haue let slip such words, as
may giue occasion to our Aduersaries, so to thinke of vs:
we doe not, nor are we bound to iustifie euery hot and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke
speech, breathed out in eagernesse of disputation.
<hi>Good workes</hi> they be, truly and verily <hi>good:</hi> but they are
not perfectly good. When a godly man prayes he doth well:
but he neuer doth so well; but he may doe better. Nor dare
any man in the world auouch, that either the roote whence
<hi>good actions</hi> come, is purged by perfect <hi>Holinesse:</hi> or the
manner of doing them, is so exactly kept in a precise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of euery <hi>circumstance,</hi> or the end in doing them
Gods <hi>glory,</hi> and Mans <hi>good,</hi> so syncerely and truely aimed at:
that the <hi>seuerity of Gods Iustice,</hi> cannot finde any the least
failing in any of those things. This is all we teach touching
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14751:60"/>
the <hi>sinfulnesse of good workes,</hi> and thus we stand too: as a most
certaine truth. And we say. That this <hi>sinnefulnesse</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
our <hi>good workes,</hi> is sufficient to barre vs from <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
by them. For we deserue not reward for what is
well done, except all were well done. But neuerthelesse it
shall not hinder Gods gracious acceptation of our <hi>good
workes,</hi> who is well pleased with the obedience of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
so farre as it is good and holy: and when it failes, for
<hi>Christs</hi> sake he mercifully pardoneth their Trespasses. Thus
much of the second Argument. The third is from reason
grounded on Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>3 Where there are (<hi>sufficientia principia rectae operatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>)
sufficient causes and meanes of well-doing: there a
good worke may be done without all fault.—But in a man
Regenerate, there are causes and meanes sufficient for
well-doing—Ergo, He may doe well, and not offend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They proue the</hi> Minor <hi>thus.</hi> To the performance of any
good worke, there is required nothing, but these things,
Knowledge of what is to be done, will and power to do it—
But now a Regenerate man hath all these. For first, his
vnderstanding is enlightned, so that hee can easily know
what is good to be done. Secondly, his will and affections
are sanctified and aided by grace, to desire and endeauour
the performance of it. And thirdly, and lastly, hee hath
power to put in practise what he knowes and desires, there
being no impediment inward, or outward that should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him—Ergo, he may doe well and sinne not.</p>
                  <p>Here we desire them to shew vs. How a man <hi>Regenerate</hi>
is enduded with such perfect abilities, as may helpe him:

                  <p>This (<hi>they say</hi>) is done by the grace of Sanctification,
giuen vnto a Regenerate man, whereby hee is freed from
all contagion of sinne: and such incombrances, as hinder
him in well-doing. For by this grace giuen to him, hee is
made a good tree: now [A good tree cannot bring foorth

fruit onely which is good. Which Similitude of a Branch
much illustrates the matter (<hi>in their Imagination.</hi>) For
as in a Vine-Branch. If first it haue sufficient moisture
from the Body of the Vine. Secondly, if it haue sufficient
heat of the Sunne to digest that moysture. And thirdly,
if it be not hurt nor hindred by Frosts, Wette, Windes,
Wormes, or other such discommodities of the Ayre and
Soile; then certainely it will be are very much, and very
good fruit: so is it in a man regenerate. From Christ he
receiues sufficient moisture of Diuine Grace, which is in
him, [as a well of water springing vp vnto euerlasting life.
Iohn 4. 14.] He hath heat sufficient of spirituall affection,
to cause him to bud forth into good workes. For Christ
saith [I am come to send fire on the earth, and what will I
if it be already kindled. Luke 12. 49. And [Did not our
hearts burne within vs] said the two Disciples that went
to Emaus, Luk. 24. 32. Ergo, they haue heat enough. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
they haue no impediment. Neither inward. For
why? It is written, Rom. 8. 1. There is no condemnation
to them that are in Christ Iesus. Ergo, no inward impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to well-doing. Nor outward. For it written, [nothing
shall separate vs from the Loue of God, that is in Christ
Iesus our Lord, Rom. 8. 38. Ergo, no outward impediment
of good workes.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto we make answer. That this Argument is a <hi>sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall</hi>
cauillation; which proues that which we do not deny.
They say that a Man Regenerate, hath <hi>sufficientia principia
rectae &amp; honestae operationis.</hi> We say so too; confessing that
hee is made a good tree, a fruitfull Branch; that hee is en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lightened;
sanctified, and strengthened by the spirit of God
vnto the performance of <hi>good workes.</hi> We grant that now
he is enabled to doe well, who before his <hi>Regeneration</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:14751:61"/>
could doe nothing saue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll: but the question still remaines,
whether now he doe so well, as that he doth nothing ill
when he doth best. We grant that the <hi>Vine,</hi> which in former
time yeelded nothing, but wild grapes, now being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
and grafted into the best <hi>Vine,</hi> beares good grapes:
but we deny that they are so weet and kindly in eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

as not to haue a little relish still of their former wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sowrenesse. Wherefore our Aduersaries doe but
trifle with vs to tell vs that Men Regenerate haue meanes
sufficient to doe those workes that be good: this we deny
not; but we question whether they haue helpe sufficient to
performe any worke so absolutely and perfectly good; that
<hi>God</hi> himselfe cannot charge it with any <hi>Sinne</hi> at all. This
we constantly deny. And to their discourse, (<hi>That a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate

proued. Our imperfections in euery one of these three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars

He consents to this motion, and resols vpon the execution, which
(supposing that he be rich) nothing now can hinder because he
is both able and willing to giue. Now then this almes being
thus giuen out of knowledge, and a pious motion of the Heart
tending to Gods honour and our Neighbours good, the Iesuit

desires to knew of vs, where their is any Sinne in it.</hi> Wee say
there is some euill in euery good worke and therefore hee
would haue vs tell him what euill there is in this <hi>Almesdeed.</hi>
Vnto this we say, that this enquiry of the <hi>Iesuite</hi> is the most
ridiculous and absurd thing, that can be. He asketh vs where
is the Sinne? what if we answere him <hi>we doe not know;</hi> Is hee
now euer the wiser? what hath he gained hereby? Are other
Mens worke without all faults because we know not what
they be? Nay, are they without fault, because themselues
know not whether there be any in them: or no? what sili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
were it to argue in this sort? Therefore when wee
come to this point strictly to examine the workes of Men.
First we tell the <hi>Iesuite</hi> that he must not <hi>put Cases</hi> touching
<hi>generalities [suppose that such a good worke be done so and so
what then</hi>] we dispute now touching <hi>particulars</hi> in euery
<hi>Mans reall practice.</hi> The enquiry is not for the generall.
(<hi>What euill is there in such and such a good worke</hi>) <hi>done thus
and thus, according as the Circumstances are framed in an
Imagined Case.</hi> As to aske what <hi>Sinne</hi> is their in an <hi>Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede</hi>
done out of <hi>Faith and Charity to Gods glory.</hi> This is a
fond question thus framed vpon generall termes we say
their is no Sinne in it. But the enquiry is in particular, what
<hi>Euill</hi> their is in such a worke done by this or that, Man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all Circumstances, that were at that time incident
to the worke, as. <hi>What sinne was there in Zacheus or Cornelius
almes-deeds?</hi> This question we admit, and answere to it,
That some <hi>Sinne</hi> there was for which those holy Men, as wel
as others, would not haue beene willing that God should
enter into iudgement with them, strictly to iudge them. Yea,
but will the Iesuits reply, name what <hi>Sinne</hi> this was; or else
you wrong them. Now this is meere impudency. For who is
judge of their actions? Are we? or is it God and their owne
<hi>Consciences?</hi> we can be no judges, who at furthest can
judge but accordrng to outward appearance. We know not
their <hi>Hearts:</hi> nor are we priuy vnto euery particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
that did accompany those actions of theirs Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14751:62"/>
in euery particular action differ infinitely, one
Man may offend in this point, another in that: nor haue we
a <hi>generall Rule</hi> whereby to judge alike of all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a childish <hi>quaere</hi> to aske on Man whether another
Man offendes, who may doe euill a 1000 times, not only
<hi>secret</hi> from others, but <hi>vnwitting</hi> to himselfe. If then the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite</hi>
will haue an answere to his question, he must resort to
particular mens Consciences, and to God: for only the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of Man, and the <hi>spirit</hi> of God know the things of Man.
Let him aske a <hi>Cornelius</hi> when he giues almes, whether he
doe thinke this worke so well done, that no fault can bee
found with it. Doubtlesse he will answere, that he cannot
excuse himselfe from all faultinesse: though he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by himselfe, yet he dares not stand to Gods judgment.
His confession and prayer would in this case be the same

                  <p>This of the third Argument. That Man hath sufficient
meanes to doe well and not Sinne. The last followes, drawne
from such absurdities, as they say doe follow vpon our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

Men be Sinfull: then these absurdities be likewise true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
That to be iustified by faith is to be iustified by Sin.
That no man ought to beleeue, because the worke [Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing]
is Sinne. That all good works are forbidden, because
all Sinne is forbidden. That God should command vs to

commit Sinne: because he commands vs to doe good
workes. That God bidding vs be zelous of go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should in effect bid vs be zealous of mortall Sinne.
That to pray for the pardon of Sinne were a damnable
Sinne. These and such other absurd Positions would
be true: if the protestants doctrine concerning the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of good workes may stand for good.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto we answere. That these absurdities issue not
out of our Doctrine, but out of our Aduersaries malitious
<hi>Imaginations.</hi> Who like the ragine Sea casting vp mire and
Dirt from its owne Bottome would faine throw all this filth
in the face of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> to make them odious
and hatefull to the world. The best is. Truth cannot bee
disgraced though it may be belyed. These foule Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
touch vs not: but follow vpon that Doctrine which
is none of ours. Namely, <hi>That the good works of the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
are in their very Nature altogether sins, and nothing else
but sordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inquinamenta, &amp; merae iniquitates.</hi> Such an absurd
assertion would indeed yeeld such an absurd consequence.
But we defended it not: &amp; they abuse vs grosly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their
writings they report of vs the contrary that we doe maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
This onely we teach. <hi>That mens good workes are in
part sinfull.</hi> Much good they haue in them: but with all
some euill mingled therewith. Amongst the gold, some
drosse also will be sound, that will not be able to abide the
fire of Gods seuere Tryall. Imperfections will appeare in
our best workes, so long as humane infirmity and mortality
hangs vpon vs. This we teach, and from this Doctrine all
that haue reason, may see that no such vnreasonable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
can be collected. And let thus much suffice for the
clearing of this third <hi>Proposition,</hi> touching the imperfection
of our obedience to the <hi>Morrall Law of God,</hi> euen in the
<hi>good workes</hi> which we performe. From whence euery god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

it is a grosse absurdity to deny the <hi>Sinnefulnesse</hi> of these

                  <p>We conclude then that <hi>Concupiscence</hi> and inordinate

to our Aduersaries assertion.</p>
                  <p>They bring some Reasons to proue they are not.</p>
                  <p>1 Originall sinne is taken away in Baptisme.<note place="margin">1 Arg. Adu.</note> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
is not taken away in Baptisme; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by experience in the regenerate in whom it
remaines.—Ergo, concupiscence and pronnesse to
Sinne, is no sinne.</p>
                  <p>This Argument is friuolous. In <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> there are
two things, First, <hi>the guilt.</hi> Secondly, <hi>the inherent corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
We say in <hi>Baptisme</hi> the <hi>guilt</hi> is altogether washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the <hi>Baptized Elect,</hi> by the blood of <hi>Christ.</hi> And
for the <hi>corruption</hi> thereof, it is part done away by the <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Spirit of Christ,</hi> powred out vpon the <hi>Regenerate,</hi>
which by degrees purgeth out the inherent <hi>sinfulnesse</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> by replanting the <hi>graces of Sanctification</hi> in all
parts. Concupiscence then, notwithstanding <hi>Baptisme</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
in the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> and is a sinne in them, the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
whereof God mercifully pardons in Christ.</p>
                  <p>2 What is not in our power to auoide:<note place="margin">2 Arg. Adu.</note> that God doth not
forbid vs by his Law.</p>
                  <p>But tis not in our power to auoide the Motions of the
heart that preuent Reason and consent. Ergo, they
be no sinnes forbidden vs.</p>
                  <p>To this we answere. The <hi>Maior</hi> is true in things meerely
<hi>Naturall,</hi> that fall out by the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Nature well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
So we say, Gods Law were vncouth, should he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a man neuer to be an <hi>hungry</hi> or <hi>thirst,</hi> which things
he cannot auoide, but they come vpon him, will he, nill he;
by the meere <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> But concerning inordinate
<hi>motions,</hi> there's no such matter. God hath layed no such <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
on <hi>Nature</hi> in her creation: but we by our <hi>sinne</hi> haue
brought it upon our selues.</p>
                  <p>Now such a <hi>necessity</hi> excuses vs not. In this case it helpes
a man no more to say. [<hi>I cannot auoid euill thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:</hi>]
then it doth a desperate sinner, that by countenance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14751:65"/>

the Diuels and the damned, if they should say; <hi>Wee cannot

                  </p>

                  <p>But motions preuenting consent, would be naturall,
and without fault in men so made.—Ergo, In vs
they be no faults of themselues.</p>
                  <p>Heere our Aduersaries haue made a Man of white <hi>Paper,</hi>
or the like to <hi>Materia prima:</hi> that hath not any <hi>quality</hi> in him
<hi>morally</hi> good or bad. That is. A Man that hath neither the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God in <hi>knowledge, righteousnes,</hi> and <hi>holines,</hi> engrauen
on his <hi>vnderstanding, will, affections,</hi> and whole <hi>person;</hi> nor
yet, though it haue it not, hath in him any contrary euill <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
that comes vpon him by reason of such a defect. Now of
such a <hi>Wiseaker</hi> they dispute. If God had created a Man thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> neither good, nor bad, then. What
then? As the old word is. <hi>If the Heauens fall, we shall haue
Larkes good cheepe.</hi> Suppositions framed by our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
touching what might be done, are vaine and needlesse
when we see what is done. This we see that Man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in God's Image invested with all <hi>reall Qualities</hi> of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi>
and <hi>Holinesse.</hi> This we see also, that Man being falne
is borne in <hi>Originall corruption,</hi> depriued of God's Image, &amp;
thereupon depraued in his whole Nature by <hi>sinfull infirmity.</hi>
Wherefore a man in his pure <hi>Naturals,</hi> one that hath neither
<hi>Grace,</hi> nor <hi>Corruption,</hi> was neuer found in this world: yea,
'tis a contradiction to imagine a man thus naked without
his <hi>Qualities;</hi> that he hath <hi>Reason,</hi> but neither enlightened,
nor darkened, a will but meerely indifferent, neither enclined
to good, or euill; affections, but neither vertuously, nor viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
disposed. In a word, that he is a Man capable of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
or <hi>Vice; Holinesse,</hi> or <hi>Sinfulnesse,</hi> and yet hath neither.

the lower <hi>Spheares</hi> would moue differently from the <hi>superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:</hi>
but yet most orderly according to their owne nature,
without impeaching the Motions of the other. Each faculty
in it's place would worke orderly in sweet harmony and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement

and <hi>discord</hi> into the world, as betweene God and Man:
so betweene Man and himselfe. This we further make good
by this argument. Whatsoeuer is naturall, and so without
blame in Man: that <hi>Christ</hi> took one him—But these inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Motions of the <hi>sensitiue appetite,</hi> repugnant vnto <hi>Will</hi>
and <hi>Reason; Christ</hi> tooke not on him—<hi>Ergo</hi> they are not
<hi>naturall,</hi> and without blame. The <hi>Maior</hi> we proue by that,
<hi>Phil. 3. 7. He was made like vnto Man:</hi> and <hi>Heb. 2. 17. In all
things it behoued him to be made like vnto his Brethren.</hi> And
againe, <hi>Chap. 4. 15. Wee haue not a high Priest which cannot be
touched with a feeling of our infirmities: but was in all things
tempted in like sort: yet without Sinne.</hi> Whence 'tis manifest
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14751:66"/>
that <hi>Christ</hi> taking on him our Nature, tooke on him all the
properties of our Nature, and with all such infirmities of our
Nature as not sinfull in themselues, or the effects or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Sinne</hi> in vs. If therefore it be naturall vnto Man,
that the Motions of the <hi>sensitiue appetite</hi> should preuent and
be <hi>repugnant</hi> vnto <hi>Reason,</hi> and that this is no <hi>Sinne</hi> except
consent make it so: then certainly <hi>Christ</hi> had in him such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and inordinate desires. But to affirme that, there were
in <hi>Christ</hi> such disorderly Motions of his inferiour Faculties,
repugnant vnto his <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> is a blasphemie against
the <hi>immaculate Lambe of God, Christ</hi> was indeed temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>But there is no Law prescribed vnto sense and sensuall

Law praesupposeth Reason in all that whereto it is giuen.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14751:67"/>
But the sensitiue part of Man is without Reason, and
ergo not capable of a Law, according as it is in bruite
beasts, to whom ergo no Law is giuen. <hi>This he further
proues by that place,</hi> Rom. 7. 20. Now if I doe that
I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but Sinne that
dwelleth in me. Where 'tis plaine (<hi>saith</hi> Bell.) that
the Apostle did not sinne, because he lusted against his
will. 'Twas not he did the worke: but 'twas the Sinne in
him. <hi>Wherefore he saith afterward.</hi> That in his
mind, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his superior faculties he serued the Law of
God: and kept it: although in his flesh, <hi>i. e.</hi> sensitiue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
and inferiour faculties he serued the Law of sin:
yet, for all that he sinned not in so doing, because sinne
cannot be but in the minde, and the Law is not giuen
to those facul<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies that be vnreasonable.</p>
                  <p>To this we answere. That God giues no Law to vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<hi>Creatures,</hi> but such as haue <hi>Reason.</hi> The <hi>sensitiue
faculties</hi> of <hi>bruite-beasts</hi> haue no other <hi>Rule</hi> then <hi>Natures</hi>
instinct, which guides and moderates their seuerall motions
in due order and measure. But in man those inferiour <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
how euer <hi>vnreasonable,</hi> are yet capable of <hi>Reasons Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,</hi>
which according to Gods Law prescribes vnto
the motions of the <hi>sensitiue appetite</hi> their measure and
bounds, beyond which they may not passe. If a man were
vncorrupt, the appetite would obey this rule of Reason and
keepe it selfe within those prescribed Bounds. But being
now corrupt by <hi>Sinne,</hi> it breakes out beyond this compasse
and ouerbeares <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> which in their sinfull weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
are not able to bridle these vnrulie motions. wherefore
when <hi>Bell.</hi> saieth. <hi>That the Law is giuen to the reasonable
will, not to the sensiue appetite;</hi> it is vtterly false: Because in
Man it is probable of <hi>gouernment,</hi> and so subject to the Law.
Our <hi>Reason</hi> hath euen in this our corrupted estate a ciuill
command ouer our appetite and affections; so that it can
moderate them by faire persuasions now and then. That
which it can doe sometimes, it ought to doe alwaies, and if
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14751:67"/>
any affections can obey <hi>Reason</hi> at sometimes, were they not
infected with <hi>Sinne,</hi> they would doe it at all times. And if
they doe well when they obey, certainly they doe euill
when they disobey. And <hi>ergo</hi> such motions of them, as are
repugnant to right <hi>reason,</hi> are nothing but <hi>rebellion</hi> against
God's Law. As to the place in the 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> we answere. That
that Interpretation of it which <hi>Bell.</hi> brings is most peruerse
and against all <hi>Sense.</hi> The Apostle complaines that he did
the Euill, which he would not; no doubt in so doeing he did
<hi>sinne.</hi> But what is it now which committed this guilt or
sinne? <hi>It is not I that doe it saieth the Apostle: but that sinne
that dwelleth in me.</hi> That is, according to <hi>Bell:</hi> not I in my
mind, or superior faculties of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Will:</hi> but my infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Appetite and affections which doe this euill against my
consent. So the meaning shalbe <hi>Concupiscence</hi> in that duell
in the Apostle committed <hi>Sinne:</hi> but the <hi>Apostle</hi> himselfe
committed it not. Which is very absurd. As if a <hi>cholericke-Man</hi>
hauing done a mischiefe in his anger should sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, It
were not he did it; but his raging passion: or an <hi>adulterer,</hi>
that 'twas not he committed the <hi>Sinne;</hi> but his sinfull Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that carried him further then <hi>reason</hi> would. So that
if God will punish such a sinne; he must not punish him:
but onely his sensitiue <hi>appetite</hi> which was in fault. This is
ridiculous, for besides that it crosseth the <hi>Romanists</hi> Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
manifestly; in teaching that such disorderly motions of
the <hi>sensitiue appetite</hi> be no sinnes, which heere the <hi>Apostle</hi>
contradicts, saying plainly (<hi>that the Sinne which dwelt in
him did doe the euill he would not.</hi> (viz, <hi>Sinne:</hi>) it draweth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it this grosse Error. <hi>That some faecultie in man may sin,
and yet the man not sinne himselfe.</hi> Wherefore the Apostle in
that speach, <hi>'Tis not I doe it: but sinne in me.</hi> doth not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
one facultie against the other, the <hi>reasonable will,</hi> against
the <hi>sensitiue appetite,</hi> seeking for a shift to excuse his sinne,
by putting it off from himselfe, to that which was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>Sinne:</hi> but he opposeth <hi>grace</hi> in euery <hi>facultie</hi> to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>

doth euill) <hi>'tis not I that doe it.</hi> i. e, I regenerate according
to the Grace, that dwelleth in me, for that inclines me to
doe good: but 'tis <hi>the Sinne dwelling in me</hi> which (when
I would doe well) inclines me to doe euill. He heere shewes

For the proofe of this point we are to obserue, that the
<hi>Imperfection,</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> of any thing is to be considered of
two waies.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Comparatiuely.</hi> When any thing set by another is
more or lesse perfect, then that other.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Absolutely.</hi> When considered in it selfe, it hath or
wantes that <hi>Perfection</hi> which it should haue by its proper
Nature.</p>
                  <p>Betweene these there is great difference. For Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
imperfection is not euill: absolute imperfection is Euill.
We may see it in an example, The Senses that are in Man
being compared with their like in other creatures, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
they are much excelled by them, as by an Eagle for sight,
a spider for touch. &amp;c. Heere we say that the eie of a man is
not perfect as the eie of an Eagle: but yet we doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this imperfection any <hi>Naturall euill</hi> of the eie of a man.
God might haue giuen a stronger and a clearer sight to
men: but we, blame not his workes; nor count our sight
imperfect because it hath not that singular Temper which is
in other <hi>Creatures;</hi> but because it wants at any time that
temper which is agreeable to our nature. Such a <hi>defect</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is properly an Euill in <hi>Nature,</hi> when something is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the perfection of any part, which by the Course of
nature should be there. Thus 'tis also in Grace. Compare
we the <hi>Righteousnes</hi> of man, or <hi>Angels,</hi> with the <hi>Righteousnes
of God;</hi> we saie that God's is <hi>infinitely</hi> more perfect then the
<hi>Creatures.</hi> But now is this <hi>imperfection in Humane or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
righteousnes</hi> any Euill and Sinne in them? We saie
No. Neither are the <hi>Angels</hi> sinfull because lesse righteous
then God: nor <hi>Adam</hi> sinfull because lesse righteous then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
God made them both lesse good then himselfe: yet <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good</hi> and without all Sinne. There be degrees of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi>
and though the Creature be infinitely below the
heighest pitch of <hi>goodnes</hi> (which is God:) yet he may bee
still aboue that lowest descent vnto <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
In <hi>Phylosophie</hi> we dispute whether the slackening of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14751:69"/>
any degree in one <hi>Quality,</hi> be the mingling of another that is
<hi>contrary.</hi> As heat in eight degrees if it decrease vnto seuen,
whether there is any degree of cold mingled with it. 'Tis
heard to say that there is. But concerning <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi>
'tis certaine, there is that <hi>remissio graduum</hi> without
any <hi>admixtion</hi> of <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>iniquity.</hi> As the <hi>Holines</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi>
is lesse then that of <hi>Angels;</hi> that of <hi>Angels</hi> lesse then the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi>
of <hi>Christs</hi> glorified <hi>Humanity,</hi> this lesse then his <hi>Diety.</hi>
And yet in the least of these <hi>Righteousnesses</hi> there is no <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes</hi>
at all to be found, no not in the seuere judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>God.</hi> Except we say there is <hi>vnrighteousnes</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>
where no vncleane thing can enter. Well then. What
Imperpection of mans Righteousnes is it, which is <hi>Sinne?</hi>
We say. That <hi>Imperfection,</hi> when man in any <hi>Grace</hi> or
good <hi>Worke</hi> wantes that degree of <hi>goodnes,</hi> which he ought
to haue. As in nature. If the Eye want that cleernes of <hi>sight</hi>
which should be in it: 'tis a naturall Euill. <hi>In Morality</hi> if
a man want that <hi>Temperance</hi> or degree of <hi>Temperance</hi> he
ought to haue, its a <hi>vitious</hi> and morall euill: so in <hi>Grace</hi> the
want of that <hi>righteousnes</hi> or degree of <hi>righteonsnes</hi> which
<hi>God</hi> requires to be in man, is a <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>spirituall</hi> Euill. All
such <hi>priuations</hi> of what should be present are Euill in what
kind soeuer. If they be in nature they be <hi>malamiseranda,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue

these in <hi>Grace,</hi> when man fals short, not onely of that which

this is admirable, that such acts as these should defile a man,
deserue hell, offend God, in a word be sinnes, and yet for all
this neither commanded nor forbidden in any Law of God.
Was there euer such a toy heard of as this? as <hi>Sinnes</hi> beside

of <hi>Sinne?</hi> Doth God the Law-giuer? No, for twas not his
intention to command or forbid such an act, and <hi>ergo,</hi> be it
done or not done, it crosseth not his will: nor hath he any
reason to finde fault or be displeased at it. <hi>Satan</hi> or <hi>Man</hi>
cannot accuse him. For let them then shew the Law that
prooues him an offender. If they cannot alleadge a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which he hath transgressed: they wrongfully accuse
him of a fault. Were it not absurd accusation against a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
at the Barre; to say that he hath indeed done nothing
against the Lawes of the Land: but many things besides the
Law not forbidden nor commanded in the Law, those hee
hath done and deserues to be punished for it as an offender?</p>
                  <p>But now if those <hi>veniall sinnes</hi> bee mentioned in Gods
Law: then are such actions either commanded or forbidden.
If commanded, then the not doing of such a thing, is plainely
contrary to the Law. As for example.<note n="c" place="margin">

                     </note> To steale a penny,

                  <p>The fourth <hi>period</hi> and last is from Christs death, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

that Couenant a new: which so long before had beene

the Church with aboundance of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and of
<hi>grace,</hi> still to continue and increase, till the consummation of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14751:73"/>
all things. In all these <hi>periods</hi> of time, the grace of God that
brings saluation to man was euer one and the same: onely
the Reuelation thereof, was with much variety of <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
as God saw it agreeable to euery season. In the first
twas called a <hi>Promise,</hi> in the second a <hi>Couenant,</hi> in the two

death; the New from thence to the worlds end, in both <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes,</hi> and <hi>Saluation</hi> bequeathed as a Legacy vnto
the Church: and this bequeast ratified by the death of the

the Old: <hi>Really</hi> put to death in his owne <hi>Person,</hi> for the
<hi>Sanction</hi> of the New <hi>Testament.</hi> But notwithstanding this
or any other diuersity in <hi>circumstance,</hi> the substance of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> or couenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> is but one &amp; the same, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ages. Namely, <hi>Iesus Christ yesterday, and to day, and
the same for euer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place. By the <hi>Couenant</hi> of <hi>Workes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Couenant. 2 Workes.</note> we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that we call in one word the <hi>Law:</hi> Namely, That
meanes of bringing man to <hi>Saluation,</hi> which is by perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
vnto the will of God. Hereof there are also two
seuerall <hi>Administrations.</hi> 1 The first is with <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his fall. When <hi>Immortality</hi> and <hi>Happinesse</hi> was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to Man, and confirmed by an externall <hi>Symbole</hi> of the
<hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> vpon <hi>condition</hi> that he continued obedient to
God, as well in all other things; as in that particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of not eating of the <hi>Tree of knowledge</hi> of <hi>good</hi>
and <hi>euill.</hi> 2 The second Administration of this Couenant
was the renuing thereof with the <hi>Israelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi>
where (after that the light of Nature began to grow darker,
and <hi>corruption</hi> had in time worne out the Characters of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
and <hi>Vertue,</hi> first graued in mans heart) God reuiued
the Law, by a compendious and full declaration of all duties
required of man, towards God or his Neighbour, expressed
in the Decalogue. According to the Tenor of which Law
God entred into Couenant with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> promising to
be their God; in bestowing vpon them all blessings of
Life and Happinesse, vpon condition that they would be his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14751:73"/>
people, obeying all things that he had commanded. Which
Condition they accepted of, promising an absolute Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<hi>All things which the Lord hath said we will doe. Exod.</hi>
19. 24. and also submitting themselues to all punishment in
case they disobeyed; saying <hi>Amen</hi> to the <hi>Curse</hi> of the Law.
<hi>Cursed be euery one that confirmeth not all the words of this
Law to doe them: and all the people shall say, Amen. Deut.</hi>
27. 26.</p>
                  <p>We see in briefe what these <hi>Couenants</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> &amp; <hi>Workes</hi>
are. In the second place we must inquire what <hi>opposition</hi>
there is betweene these two; <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Workes;</hi> the <hi>Gospell</hi>
and the <hi>Law.</hi> The opposition is not in regard of the End
whereat both doe aime. They agree both in one common
end, namely the <hi>Glory</hi> of God in Mans <hi>eternall Saluation.</hi>
The disagreement is in the meanes, whereby this End may
be attained; which are proposed to Men in one sort by the
Law, in another by the Gospell. The diuersity is this. <hi>The
Law offers life vnto Man vpon Condition of perfect Obedience,
cursing the Transgressors thereof in the least point with eternall
Death: The Gospell offers Life vnto Man vpon another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
viz. Of Repentance, and Faith in Christ, promising Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes to such as repent and beleeue.</hi> That this is the
maine <hi>Essentiall</hi> and proper difference betweene the <hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of workes and of Grace (that is) betweene the Law and
the <hi>Gospell,</hi> we shall endeauour to make good against these of
the <hi>Romish Apostasy</hi> who deny it. Consider we then the Law
of Workes, either as giuen to <hi>Adam</hi> before the promise: or
as after the promise it remained in some force with <hi>Adam</hi> &amp;
all his posterity. For the time before Mans fall. It is apparant
that perfect obedience was the condition required for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing
of <hi>Adam</hi> in perpetuall blisse. Other meanes there
was not: nor needed any be proposed vnto him. But when
Man had failed in that Condition; and so broken the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of Workes: God to repaire Mans ruined Estate, now
desperate of euer attaning vnto happines by the first means:
he appoints a second offering vnto <hi>Adam</hi> a Sauiour; that by
Faith in him, and not by his owne vnspotted Obedience, hee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14751:74"/>
might recouer <hi>Iustification,</hi> and Life which he had lost. So
that what <hi>Adam</hi> should haue obtained by workes without
Christ: now hee shall receiue by Faith in Christ without
Workes. Since the time of Mans fall we must consider, that
the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospell</hi> though they goe together, yet as they
still differ in their vse and office betweene themselues: so also
the Law differs from it selfe, in that vse which it had before,
and which it hath since the Fall. To vs now, it hath not the
same vse which it had in Mans innocency. It was giuen to
<hi>Adam</hi> for this end, to bring himselfe to Life, and for that
purpose it was sufficient both in it selfe, as an absolute <hi>Rule</hi>
of <hi>Perfection:</hi> and in regard of <hi>Adam</hi> who had strength to
haue obserued it. But vnto Man fallen, although the Band of
Obedience doe remaine: yet the End thereof (viz.) Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Life by it, is now abolished by the promise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Law now is insufficient for that purpose, not of it
selfe, but by reason of our sinfull flesh, that cannot keepe it.
This is most manifest by the renewing of the first <hi>Couenant</hi>
of Workes with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when God deliuered vnto them
the Morall Law, from <hi>Sinai,</hi> at which time God did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that the <hi>Iewes</hi> should obtaine <hi>Saluation,</hi> by Obedience
to that Law. God promised Life if they could obey, and the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> as their duty was promised they would obey; but
God knew well enough they were neuer able to keepe their
promise, and <hi>ergo</hi> 'twas not God's intention in this Legall <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant</hi>
with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that any of them should euer attaine
<hi>Iustification,</hi> and Life by that meanes. As that first the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
need not to haue bin made vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> if the Law could
haue suffised for the attaining of Life: so after the <hi>Promise</hi>
was once made, the Law was not renewed with the <hi>Iewes;</hi> to
that end that <hi>Righteousnes</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> should be had by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of it. This is the plaine doctrine of the <hi>Apostle. Gal.</hi>
3. in that his excellent dispute against <hi>Iustification</hi> by the
Law. The doubt that troubled the <hi>Galatians</hi> was this. God
had made an <hi>Evangelicall couenant</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that in
<hi>Christ</hi> he and his <hi>faithfull seed</hi> should be blessed; that is, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</hi>
Afterward 430 yeares, he made a <hi>Legall couenant</hi> with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14751:74"/>
                     <hi>Abraham's posterity,</hi> that they should <hi>liue,</hi> that is, be <hi>justified</hi>
and saued, if they did fulfill all things written in the Law. The
<hi>Quaestion</hi> now was, which of these two <hi>couenants</hi> should
stand in force, or whether both could stand together. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
answere, that the former <hi>couenant</hi> should stand in
force, and that the later did not abrogate the former; not
yet could stand in force together with the former. This he
expresseth v. 17. 18. <hi>And this</hi> I <hi>say, that the couenant that was
confirmed afore of God in respect of Christ, the Law which was</hi>
430 <hi>yeares after, cannot disanull that it should make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of none effect. For if the inheritance (viz) of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and life, be by the Law; it is not by the Promise: but God gaue
it to Abraham by Promise,</hi> Heere now they might object,
<hi>Wherefore then serueth the Law?</hi> If Men cannot bee <hi>iustified</hi>
by keeping the Law, to what end was it giuen so long after
the <hi>Promise</hi> was made? To this the <hi>Apostle</hi> answeres. It <hi>was
added (vnto the Promise) because of the transgressions.</hi> Here's
the true vse of the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> since the fall of <hi>Man,</hi> not to
justifie him and giue life: but to proue him to be vniust and
worrhy of death. It was added [<hi>because of transgressions.</hi>] that
is. 1. To convince Man of <hi>Sinne,</hi> that he might be put in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
what was his duty of old; and what was his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
infirmity in doing of it, and what was God's wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him for not doing it. That seeing how impossible it
was for him to attaine vnto life by this old way of the Law.
First appointed in <hi>Paradise,</hi> he might be humbled and driuen
to looke after that new way, which God had since that time
layed forth, more heedfully attending the <hi>Promise,</hi> and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the End of the Law vnto euery one
that beleeues in him. Which vse God pointed out vnto the
Iewes, figuring <hi>Christ</hi> vnto them in the <hi>Mercyseate,</hi> couering
the <hi>Arke</hi> wherein the Tables of the Couenant were kept, and
in the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> appointed for all sorts of <hi>Transgressions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this <hi>Couenant.</hi> To admonish the Iewes a further thing
was aimed at in giuing them the Law, namely the bringing
of them—to <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>promised seed,</hi> in whom
Remission of Sinnes, and Life Eternall was to bee had.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14751:75"/>
1. To restraine <hi>Man</hi> from <hi>Sinne.</hi> That the Law might be
a perpetuall rule of Holinesse and Obedience whereby Man
should walke and glorifie God to the vtmost of his power.
That so those <hi>Iewes</hi> might not thinke that God by making
a gracious <hi>Promise,</hi> had vtterly nullified the Law, and that
now Men might liue as they list; but that they might know
these bounds prescribed them of God, within which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
they were to keep themselues, that so the ouer-flowing
of <hi>Iniquity</hi> might be restrained. These most excellent, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and necessary vses of the morall Law, God intended in
renewing of the <hi>Legall couenant</hi> with the <hi>Iewes:</hi> &amp; <hi>ergo</hi> the
<hi>Apostle</hi> concludes, that God did not crosse himself, when first
he gaue the <hi>Inheritance</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> by promise, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made a <hi>Legall couenant</hi> with the <hi>Iewes</hi> his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<hi>Is the Law then against the Promises?</hi> (saith the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)
God forbid. For if there had beene a Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
which could haue giuen Life, surely Righteousnesse
should haue bin by the Law: But the Scripture hath concluded
all vnder Sinne, that the promise by the Faith of Iesus Christ
might be giuen to all that beleeue.</hi> ver. 21. 22. Whence it
is most cleare that the Law and the <hi>Gospell</hi> in some things
are subordinate and vphold one another; in other absolute,
and destroy one another: As the Law by the discouery of
Sinne and the punishment of it, humbles man and prepares
him to receaue the <hi>Gospell.</hi> 2. As the Law is a sacred directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for <hi>Holines</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to those that haue embraced
the <hi>Gospell</hi> and all others. 3. As the Law requires <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
for the Breach of it, and the <hi>Gospell promiseth</hi> such <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:</hi>
thus the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospell</hi> agree well together and
establish one another. But as the Law giues life to them
that perfectly obey it, and the <hi>Gospell</hi> giues Life to them that
stedfastly beleiue it: thus the Law and <hi>Gospell</hi> are one against
the other; and ouerthrow one another. And <hi>ergo</hi> if God
had giuen such a Law to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as could haue brought
<hi>Saluation</hi> to them through the perfect fulfilling of it: 'tis
apparant that God had made voide his former Couenant
vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> because <hi>Righteousnes</hi> should haue bin by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14751:75"/>
the Law, and not by <hi>Christ.</hi> But now God gaue no such
Law, as could be kept by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle proues,</hi>
because all were <hi>sinners</hi> against it; and therefore it followes
that notwithstanding the giuing of the Law, the <hi>Promise</hi>
standes good for euer; and <hi>Righteousnes</hi> is to be odtained
onely by the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From hence we conclude firmely. That the difference
betweene the Law and the</hi> Gospell, <hi>assigned by our</hi> Diuines
<hi>is most certaine and agreable to the</hi> Scriptures. <hi>viz. That.</hi>
The Law giues Life vnto the Iust vpon Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in all things: The Gospell giues Life vnto Sinners v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Condition, they repent and beleiue in Christ Iesus. <hi>Whence
it is plaine. That in the point of</hi> Iustification <hi>these two are</hi>
incompatible, <hi>and that therefore our</hi> minor Proposition <hi>standes
verified.</hi> That Iustification by the workes of the Law, makes
voide the Couenant of Grace. <hi>Which</hi> Proposition <hi>is the same
with the</hi> Apostles <hi>assertion else-where.</hi> Gal. 2. 21. If Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousne:

Ye are abolished from Christ: whosoeuer are iustified by the

                  <p>By somuch more iuiurious are these of the <hi>Romish Church</hi>
vnto the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> when, by denying this difference,
they would confound the Law and <hi>Gospell:</hi> and bring vs
backe from <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> to seeke for our <hi>Iustification</hi>
in the fulfilling of the <hi>Morall Law.</hi> They would persuade
vs that the <hi>Gospell</hi> is nothing, but a more perfect Law, or
the Law perfected by addition of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> enabling men to
fulfill it; That the promises of the <hi>Gospell</hi> be vpon this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
of fulfilling the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with such like stuffe. Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

most cleerely and fully expounded. Nor is the Gospell in a

to doe it: and therefore the Law giuen by Moses the Law-giuer
cannot iustifie, because it was giuen without the
grace of fulfilling it: but the Gospell giuen by Christ
the Redeemer doth justifie, because it is accompanied
with the grace of the holy Ghost, making vs able to keepe

                  <p>This is the summe of the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrine touching the

scarce a syllable of distinct Trueth: but all peruerted by ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocations
and grosse Ambiguities, as shall appeare by a

the Gospell into the doctrine of Christ, and
his Apostles, and into the Grace of the Holy Ghost: let vs
follow him in these two parts.</p>
                  <p>First for Doctrine. We grant that the Gospell is often
so taken: but in this matter about Iustification, this accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Ministery of the Gospell: yet all things which they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or wrote, is not the Gospell properly so called. But as
<hi>Moses</hi> chiefly deliuered the Law vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> though yet
with all he wrote of Christ, and so in part reuealed vnto
them the Gospell: so Christ and his Ministers, though chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they preach the Gospell, yet in its place they vrge the
law withall, as that which hath its singular vse in furthering
our Christian faith and practise. Wherefore when we speak
of the Gospell as opposite to the Law, tis a <hi>Iesuiticall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation</hi> to take it in this large sense. For the whole doctrine
of Christ and his Apostles, preached by them, and written

which is Christ the Lord.</hi> And afterward Christ and his
Apostles fully explained the mysteries thereof vnto the
world. According to this necessary distinction, we answer.
That if we take the Gospell in that large Acception; tis true
which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath. That the Gospell containes in it the
Doctrine of workes (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Morall Law, euen the very
same precepts, prohibitions, threatnings, &amp; promises which
are deliuered in the Law. All which as Christ and his Hpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
preached: so may all Ministers without blame, yea, they
must, if they will auoid blame, presse the same vpon their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14751:78"/>
hearers, seasonably and discreetly, that the Law may make
way for the better receiuing and entertainment of Grace in
the Gospell. But hence it followes not, that the Gospell
properly so taken, is to be confounded as one and the same
thing with the Law; because the Law is conjoyned with it
in the preachings and writings of the Ministers of the New
<hi>Testament.</hi> They still are deuided in their Nature and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
nor hath the Gospell any affinity with the Law in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
threatnings, or promises. Wherefore when <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
teacheth vs. That <hi>Euangelicall promises be made with

and that in the very foundation. You heard his proofes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

commands: and so be Iustified by it. we deny it, and say

being freed from <hi>slauish feare of Punishment.</hi> This is the
cheefe Reason of this <hi>opposition</hi> of <hi>Attributes.</hi> Secondly the
next is in regard of Obedience. In which respect the <hi>ministry</hi>
of the Law is said to be the <hi>Ministery</hi> of the Letter written

not power to obey; &amp; so is but as a dead Letter without the
Vertue of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> But in the Gospell grace is giuen from
<hi>Christ,</hi> who by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> sanctifieth the heart of his
Elect, that they may liue to <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> in a sincere
thought not euery way exact conformity to the Law of
God. The like answere we giue vnto another proofe of his.</p>
                  <p>2 Out of that <hi>place (Iohn 1. 17. The Law came by
Moses: but Grace and truth by Iesus Christ.)</hi> that is
(saith <hi>Bellarmine) The Law came by Moses without grace
to fulfill it: but grace to keepe it, by Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We answere. The true interpretation of these words is
this: <hi>Moses</hi> deliuered a twofold Law, <hi>morall</hi> and <hi>ceremoniall.</hi>
Opposite to these <hi>Christ</hi> hath brought a twofold <hi>priuiledge.
Grace</hi> for the <hi>morall Law,</hi> whereby we vnderstand not only
power giuen to the <hi>regenerate</hi> in part to obserue this Law,
which strength could not come by the Law it selfe: but also,
much, more <hi>Remission of sinnes</hi> committed against the
Law and so our Iustification and freedome from the guilt
of sinne and course of the <hi>Morall Law.</hi> Secondly, Truth for
the <hi>Ceremoniall Law</hi> the substance being brought in and the
shadowes vanished. wherefore the <hi>Iesuite</hi> erres greately in
this point, when he makes the <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi>
to consist in this. That strength is thereby giuen us to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the Law. The grace of God in the <hi>Gospell</hi> is chiefely our
<hi>Iustification</hi> and Redemption from the curse of the Law:
and in the next place strength afforded vs to Obey the Law
in some measure not <hi>perfectly</hi> as our Aduersaries would haue
it. In the next point he erres as much in saying that the Law
of <hi>Moses</hi> was giueu without grace to obey it. A false as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.
For although the Law of it selfe giue not <hi>grace:</hi>
yet tis certaine that <hi>grace</hi> was giuen by <hi>Christ</hi> euen then
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14751:80"/>
when <hi>Moses</hi> published the Law. Sufficient for the proofe
hereof are. 1 These excellent properties ascribed vnto the
Law of God, as in other places of the <hi>old Testament:</hi> so spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially

and all sorts of <hi>graces</hi> shining in those ancient Saints (who
liued before and after the Law was giuen. Which <hi>graces</hi>
they receaued from the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> shed vpon their hearts
by vertue of <hi>Christs</hi> mediation, whereby they receaued
strength to liue holily in Obedience vnto the Law of God.
The difference betweene these times, and those vnder the
Law, is not. That we haue <hi>grace</hi> and they had none: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

both on vs and them. In those times as the Doctrine of the
Gospell was more obscurely reuealed: so the grace w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies
it was more sparingly distributed, being confined to
to a Church collected of one nation, and bestowed vpon
that Church in a lesser measure, then now; though yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
in that measure. But in the times of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the light shines more brightly, and grace is dispenced
more liberally, being extended indifferently to all Nations
and poured vpon the Godly in a larger Abundance: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as was promised <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 31. Though also this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
must be restrained vnto whole Churches, what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
is now done; for no doubt in many particulars some
men vnder the Law exceede for abundance of Grace, many
vnder the Gospell. Wherefore it is a notable iniury vnto the
Bounty of God, and the honour of those Saints of old, to
exclude them from partaking of the Gospell; to affirme that
they were led only by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Feare,<note place="margin">Thou art our Father</note> and not of loue;

A sily Argument. <hi>Christ</hi> is as old as the <hi>World</hi>
and his Grace as ancient, as the Name of Man vpon Earth.
grace alwaies came by <hi>Crhist,</hi> &amp; was in its measure giuen by
him lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before he appear'd in the flesh. He was euer the head
of his Church, and that his Body, which he alwaies quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the blessed influence of his Spirit ministered therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Whereby the <hi>Godly</hi> before as well as since his <hi>incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
were made liuing members of that his <hi>misticall Body.</hi>
Wherefore it is apparant, that grace is not to be tied to the
Times of the <hi>Gospell</hi> and seuered from the Law. Nay, as of
old the Law was not alwaies without <hi>grace:</hi> so now many
times the <hi>Gospel</hi> it selfe is without <hi>grace Christ</hi> himselfe being
<hi>a stumbling stone and rocke of offence, the Gospell a Sauiour
of Death</hi> to those many vpon whome <hi>Grace</hi> is not bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
to beleeue and embrace it.</p>
                  <p>I conclude then. That this difference, with our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
make betweene the Law and <hi>Gospell</hi> is false: and that
their Error is pernitious in makind the <hi>Gospel</hi> to be nothing,

1 <hi>Freedome from Sinne. 2 Freedome from the Law: 3 Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 Our <hi>Freedome from Sinne</hi> stands in 2 things; 1 <hi>In our
deliuerance from the Punishment of Sinne.</hi> For whereas
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14751:82"/>
euery Sinne of it's owne Nature brings with it guiltines, and
a sure obligation vnto punishment, binding ouer the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor
vnto the paines of God's aeternall wrath by a stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger
chaine then of Steele or Adamant: <hi>Christ</hi> by his meritorious
<hi>satisfaction</hi> hath broken these bonds, and ransomed vs from
this fearefull Bondage vnto Hell and destruction. <hi>He being
made a Curse for vs, hath redeemed vs from the Curse of the
Law. Gal.</hi> 3. 13. That is, By taking on himselfe the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Sinnes, in his owne person suffering, and satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wrath and Iustice of God, he hath once for euer set
vs free from the dreadfull vengeance of God, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
should fall vpon vs for our Iniquities.</p>
                  <p>2 In our deliuerance from the Power of Sinne, which
though it abide in vs in the Reliques of our corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
yet by the power of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> dwelling in the
<hi>Hearts</hi> of the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> it is subdued and kept vnder, that
it doth not reigne nor exercise it's commanding authority
without Controle. So that whereas the <hi>Vnregenerate</hi> be the
Seruants of Sinne, wholly at the command of <hi>Satan</hi> and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
affections, the <hi>Regenerate</hi> are freed from this <hi>slauery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ruled and guided by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord, which where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it is, there is liberty, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
17. Liberty from that blindnes wherein we are holden by
Nature, not knowing what the will of God is. Liberty from
that rebellion and infirmity of our Nature, whereby we are,
nor willing, nor able to doe the will of God. From which
we are freed in part by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> inlightning our
Mindes, and changing our Hearts. This Liberty from Sinnes
dominion and damnation, <hi>S. Paul</hi> joynes together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2.

                  <p>For the cleering heereof, this in the first place is manifest.
That he which will be justified by the workes of the Law,
is necessarily tied to fulfill the whole Law: seeing ti's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
the Law should justifie them that transgresse it. In
the next place then we must proue, that for a <hi>mans Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>Proposition</hi> seemes very strange vnto our adversaries
and to be nothing else but a <hi>ground-plot</hi> wherein to build all

all <hi>Alleageance</hi> to <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>subjection</hi> to his Lawes. But
their <hi>Calumnies</hi> are not sufficient confutations of <hi>orthodox
Doctrine:</hi> for the stopping of their mouthes we throw them
this <hi>distinction,</hi> whereon they may gnaw while they breake
their teeth, before they bite it in pieces. <hi>Mans conscience</hi>
stands bound vnto the Law of God in a two fold obligation.

obserue all things whatsoeuer it commands vpon paine of

                  <p>We teach that no true Beleeuer is freed from the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
vnto <hi>Obedience,</hi> but so farre as by grace giuen him he
is enabled, he ought to striue to the vtmost, to performe all

will justifie his faith to be sound, without <hi>Hypocrisy. And ergò
our Doctrine is no doctrine of Licentiousnes.</hi> But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side we teach, That euery true beleeuer is freed from
that <hi>obligation</hi> vnto the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Law, for the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Christian man is tyed to the obseruation</hi> of the <hi>morall Law.</hi>
He tells vs <hi>that Christ is a Law-giuer aswell as a Redeemer
of his Church, praescribing orders for all in common, for each
one in particular. That he is a Iudge that sentenceth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Law. That he is a King that ruleth ouer subjects
vnto a Law. That Christ by his comming did not destroy, but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14751:85"/>
fulfill the Law, expounded it &amp; enioyned it to be observed by vs.
That his Apostles vrge it in euery Epistle. That a Christian
man sinniug offends against the Law, &amp; ergò is bound to keepe
the Law.</hi> In all which the Iesuite encounters his owne
<hi>phantasy</hi> &amp; not our doctrine which is not wounded by such
misguided weapons. For we grant without striuing, <hi>that
every Christian is tyed to obserue the Morall Law,</hi> and we

Nay we teach that he is bound to obey to the vtmost of his
power: and from this obligation no authority of Man or
Angell, Pope or Deuill, can discharge him. So much we
grant the Arguments alleaged by the <hi>Cardinall</hi> doe enforce,
and nothing else. They proue <hi>Obedience</hi> necessary to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
<hi>Christian:</hi> but they can neuer proue <hi>perfect fulfilling</hi>
of the Law, to be necessarily required of him. From this
heauy burthen <hi>Christ</hi> hath eased the shoulders of all such as
are in him by a liuely Faith, of whom God doth no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
exact perfect <hi>Obedience</hi> to his Law in those strict and
rigorous termes. that they shall be accursed if they fulfill
it not. This we proue by these Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Gal,</hi> 1. 2. 3. (<hi>Stand fast</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>in the
Liberty wherein Christ hath made vs free, and be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
againe with the yoake of bondage.</hi>) But what is this
Yoake of Bondage? Is it onely the obseruation of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall
Law?</hi> No. That was indeed part of the yoake
which the Apostles sought to lay on the <hi>Consciences</hi> of the
<hi>Galatians.</hi> But 'twas the least and the lightest part, the
weightiest burthen was the fulfilling of the <hi>Morall Law,</hi>
wherevnto by the doctrine of the false Apostles, the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
stood obliged. This is plaine by the Text in the words
following. (<hi>Behold, I Paul say vnto you that if you be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
Christ shall profit you nothing. For I testifie againe to
euery man, which is circumcised, that he is bound to keepe the
whole Law</hi>) The Apostles dispute is heere evident. The
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14751:85"/>
                     <hi>Galatians</hi> may not be circumcised, not obserue the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
Law.</hi> why? Because if they did Christ should not
profit them at all. But what reason is there for this, that
<hi>Circumcision</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> should frustrate the benefit
of <hi>Christs</hi> death? The Apostle alleageth a good reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the obseruation of the Ceremoniall Law, tied them
also to the fulfilling of the whole <hi>Morall Law.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is thus framed.</p>
                  <p>They who are bound to keep the whole Law haue no profit
at all by Christ.</p>
                  <p>But they who are circumcised, are bound to keepe the whole
Law. ergo,</p>
                  <p>They that be circumcised haue not profit at all in Christ.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>minor</hi> in this Argument is the expresse words of the
Text, and the proofe of it is euident in Reason, because the
retaining of <hi>Legall ceremonies</hi> did in effect abolish <hi>Christ's</hi>
comming in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> who by his comming in the <hi>Flesh,</hi>
had abolished them. And <hi>ergo,</hi> they who in revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, denied <hi>Christ's death,</hi> had no meanes at all to be
saued: but only by the fulfilling of the <hi>Morall Law.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
they were necessarily bound, if they meant not to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Which reason yet is of no force before <hi>Christ</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and <hi>ergo</hi> then <hi>circumcision</hi> and other <hi>legall ceremonies,</hi>
did not lay vpon the <hi>Iewes</hi> such a strict <hi>obligation</hi> to fulfill
the whole Law. The <hi>Maior Proposition</hi> is the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Apostles <hi>Enthymeme;</hi> thus. (<hi>Men circumcised are
bound to keep the whole Law: Ergo, Christ shall not profit them</hi>)
The Reason of the <hi>consequence</hi> is this <hi>Proposition,</hi> (<hi>Whosoeuer
are bound to keepe the whole Law, Christ profiteth them nothing
at all.</hi>) This Argument, and the Reason thereof, will hardly
passe with approbation in the <hi>Iesuites Schooles,</hi> (<hi>Men are
bound to the whole Law, ergo, Christ shall not profit them.</hi>)
Nay, will they reply: That's a <hi>non sequitur.</hi> For by that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>Christ's</hi> death hath cancelled that streight obligation
of fulfilling the Law: But euery one that beleeues the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of saluation in <hi>Christ,</hi> is yet notwithstanding obliged to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14751:86"/>

of <hi>Rome,</hi> and tell them that they giue the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>
the lie, when they teach that in beleeuers the obligation to

discharged by the death of <hi>Christ;</hi> directly contrarie to this
<hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Apostle.</hi> (<hi>Ye are bound to keep the whole law,

<hi>Whosoeuer are bound to keepe the whole law, to such Christ is

A <hi>conclusion</hi> most certaine, as from these irrefutable <hi>praemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>
so from most euident Reason. For if such as beleeue in
<hi>Christ,</hi> (<hi>Who through the Spirit waite for the hope of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
through Faith</hi>) as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speakes here, v. 5; if such
be yet bound to fulfill the whole Law for their <hi>Iustification,</hi>
to what end is it to belieue in <hi>Christ,</hi> vnto <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and
<hi>Iustification?</hi> If when all is doen we must be saued by doing,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14751:86"/>
what profit comes there by beleeuing? Can the <hi>conscience</hi>
find any benefit and comfort at all in Christ, when we shall
come to this wofull Conclusion; that notwithstanding there
is in <hi>Scripture</hi> much talke of <hi>Faith,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Promises,</hi> of
<hi>Grace;</hi> yet all this will bring vs no commoditie, except this

for Sinners, for vnholy, and prophane, &amp;c.</hi>) The Law
is not giuen to the Righteous. How must this bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood?
Is it not giuen (<hi>quoad directionem</hi>) as a Rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
what is to be done, what is not to be done? Yes,
vve all agree in that. Hovv is it then not giuen? 'Tis ansvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
(<hi>quoad coactionem &amp; maledictionem</hi>) as it compels to
obedience, and curseth the Transgressors. Thus is it not giuen
to the Iust. This ansvver is full of ambiguitie, and needes
some explication, that vve may knovv vvhat is the <hi>coaction</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:14751:87"/>
or <hi>compelling force</hi> of the Lavv, from vvhich the Iust are
freed. In vnfolding vvhereof our aduersaries and vve differ.
Whether are in the right, we shal see by the proposal of both
our <hi>Interpretations.</hi> They say, (<hi>The Law hath no coactiue or
compelling power ouer the Iust, because the Iust doe obey it,
spoute, libentèer, &amp; alacritèr, &amp; ex instinctu charitatis</hi>) that is,
vvillinglie, out of Loue: <hi>but it hath a compulsiue force ouer the
vniust, because they recalcitrant &amp; cogi quodammodò debent
ad obsequium</hi>) that is, they obey vnvvillinglie, being
forced to it by Terrors and Threatnings, and therefore; <hi>The
law rules not ouer the iust, as seruants who obey for feare: but
sonnes who obey for Loue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We expound it otherwise. The Law hath not coactiue
power ouer the just, because the just (that is) true beleeuers
in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> are freed from the necessity of perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
it, for the obtaining of saluation. But the Law hath
a coactiue power ouer the vnjust &amp; vnbeleeuers, because
they are obliged vnto the perfect fulfilling thereof, or else
to be certainly accursed. And <hi>ergo</hi> we say, the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand's
ouer the just as ouer Sonnes requiring of them a
faithfull and willing endeavour: but it commands ouer the
vnjust, as ouer <hi>Seruants,</hi> of whom it exacts the vttermost
farthing, and vpon the legall default threatens eternall male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
The difference then betwixt them &amp; vs, is this.
They make the coaction of the Law to consist in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or quality of mans obedience to it. The Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
when men obey vnwillingly. We make the coaction
of the Law to consist in the quality of the command, &amp;
condition, wherevpon Obedience is required. The Law
then compels, when it exacts full obedience vpon poenalty
praecisely threatned to the disobedient. Wherein the trueth
is manifestly on our side. For 'tis plaine, that compulsion
in a Law must be taken in opposition to direction, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suation,
for Lawes persuade not, but command. For if we
speake properly a Law cannot be sai'd to compell those, to
whom 'tis giuen, as if by any real and <hi>physicall</hi> operation it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14751:87"/>
did enforce them to obedience.<note place="margin">So a King in vnder the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: not the Compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law; because not tyed to the Penalty.</note> It proposeth what is to be

but it workes not on the will of man, to force it one
way, or other. Wherefore if we know what direction in a
Law is; we shall soone know what <hi>Compultion</hi> is. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
(as all agree) is the bare <hi>praescription,</hi> of what is to
be done, or left vndone. <hi>Compulsion,</hi> that is, the exaction
of obedience vpon <hi>paenalty</hi> to be inflicted. What other
coactiue force there is in a Law, no man can imagine. Well
then to apply this. The just are <hi>sub directione Legis:</hi> but
not <hi>sub coactione.</hi> This must of necessity be vnderstood
thus, the just are not vnder the coactiue power of God's
Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cause it doth not exact of them full obedience vpon
paenalty of aeternall death, to be otherwise inflicted on
them. As it doth exact of the vnjust. For otherwise there
will be no difference betweene the just and the vnjust in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of this coactiue power of the Law, if both the one and
the other be obliged to yeeld, alike, perfect obedience v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the like paenalty. In this case the Law will be as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actine
to one, as the other, exacting aequall obedience, vpon
aequall termes, both of the just and vnjust. (viz) obey
fully in all things: or you shall be cursed. The <hi>Sonne</hi> and
<hi>Seruant</hi> shall be all one, and the Law shall still command,
over the children, with as much terrour, as ouer the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue.
There is no difference in the world; in our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
doctrine, both sorts are bound to obey perfectly, or else
certainly they shall not be saued. So that the Law of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
shall be as rigorous towards one; as the other. But
we know the Scriptures offer vnto vs more mercy: and that
<hi>Christ</hi> hath discharged vs from this rigour of the Law, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which euery one, that is out of him in the state of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
is holden in bondage. As to the difference they make
(<hi>the iust obey willingly, the vnjust vnwillingly, &amp; ergo the
Law compels these and not those</hi>) this is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For it alters not the nature of the Law, that it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
with diuers affections. The Law is the same, for its
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14751:88"/>
command &amp; authority; howsoeuer it be obeyed willingly
or vnwillingly; that matters not. The Law ceaseth not to
be coactiue, because ti's willingly obeyed: euen as a slaue
ceaseth not to be vnder the coaction &amp; compelling power
of his Master, though he loue his master; and out of a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mind be content to abide in thraldome. And as <hi>Adam,</hi>
though he obeyed the Law willingly; yet was vnder the
coactiue power of it; because he was tyed to obey it, or else
he should certainly die the death for his transgression of it.
Wherefore I conclude, that the just are not freed from the
Laws <hi>direction,</hi> nor from the Lawes <hi>compulsion,</hi> as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
or enioynes them absolute obedience in all things, and
for default thereof threatens the vnauoydeable malediction
of <hi>Gods aeternall</hi> wrath.</p>

to giue occasion: but directly to teach this doctrine of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>

that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by workes when he
offered his sonne <hi>Isaack</hi> vpon the altar; and also that <hi>Rahab</hi>
was in like manner justified by workes, when she entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<hi>Conclusion. That a Man is justified by workes and not

contrary to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paule</hi> his Doctrine in his Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:14751:89"/>
and else-where. For in the fourth chap. speaking of
the same example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he saieth cleane contrary,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by workes, <hi>for then he
might haue boasted.</hi> ver. 2. And in the 3 <hi>chap.</hi> treating
generally of <hi>mans Iustification,</hi> by faith; after a strong dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
he drawes forth this <hi>conclusion. That a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith without the workes of the Law.</hi> v. 28. Which
<hi>Conclusion</hi> is in appearance <hi>contradictory</hi> to that of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iames.</hi>

1. of <hi>Iustification.</hi> 2 of <hi>Workes. Iustification</hi> (say they) <hi>of
two sortes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The first when a man of vnjust is made just and holy,
by the Infusion of Grace, or the Habit of Charitie.</p>
                  <p>2. The 2. When a man of just is made more just by the
augmentation of the Habit of Grace first giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
                  <p>Againe they diuide workes into two sortes.</p>
                  <p>1. Some goe before Faith, being performed by the meere
strength of nature, and free-will without the helpe of
grace; and such workes as these are not meritorious.</p>
                  <p>2. Some follow Faith, being performed by the aide and
assistance of grace giuen vnto man: and such workes
as these be meritorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These distinctions praepared, the worke is now ready for
the soddering, which they finish artificially glewing togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the</hi> proposition <hi>of the two</hi> Apostles <hi>in this sorte.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul
<hi>saieth that</hi> Abraham, and all men are justified by Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
workes. <hi>This (say they)</hi> is to be vnderstood of the first
Iustification, and of workes done before Faith, without grace,
by the strength of nature. <hi>So that the meaning of</hi> Paule's
proposition (Abraham and all men, are justified by faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
workes <hi>is this.</hi> Neither Abraham, nor any other can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the Grace of Sanctification, whereby of vnjust and
vnholy they be made just and holy, by any workes done by them,
when they are Naturall Men, destitute of Grace, but only by
Faith in Christ Iesus, <hi>or thus.</hi> No Man merits Grace to
make him a good Man of a Bad, by any thing he doth before he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14751:90"/>
beleeue in Christ; but by beleeuing he obtaineth this. <hi>On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side S.</hi> Iames <hi>saith, that</hi> (Abraham and all others are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by Workes, not by Faith only.) This (<hi>say the</hi> Romanists)
is meant of the second Iustification, and of such workes as are
done after Faith, by the aide of Grace: <hi>So the meaning of the</hi>
Proposition <hi>shalbe this.</hi> Abraham and other Men being
once made good and just, deserue to be made better, and more
just by such good workes as they performe through the helpe of
Grace giuen vnto them; &amp; not by faith only. Being once sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
they deserue the increase of Sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of their Faith, and good workes out of Faith and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Is not this difference between these <hi>Apostles</hi> finely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
think you? They will now walke together being in this
sort made friends through the mediation of the <hi>Schoole-men.</hi>
But it is otherwise. They are so far from reconciling them,
that they haue abused them both, and set them farther asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
making them speake what they neuer meant. Neither
in <hi>S. Paul</hi> nor <hi>S. Iames</hi> is there any ground at all, whereon
to raise such an interpretation of their words. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we respect this reconcilement, as the <hi>shifting quercke</hi> of
a <hi>Scholeman's</hi> braine, that hath no footing at all in the text.
Which we doe vpon these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. That distinction of <hi>Iustification</hi> (that is of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
into the first giuing of it, and the after increase of it,
(howsoeuer tolerable in other matters) is vtterly to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as it is applied vnto the doctrine of these <hi>Apostles.</hi>
Who when they speake of <hi>Iustification</hi> of a sinner in God's
sight doe vnderstand thereby the <hi>Remission</hi> of <hi>Sinnes</hi>
through the imputation of Christ's <hi>Righteousnes,</hi> and not
the infusion, or increase of <hi>inherent Sanctity</hi> in the soule of
man. This confusion of <hi>Iustification</hi> with <hi>sanctification</hi> is a
prime error of our adversaries in this article, as hath bin

without grace, and after Faith by grace, is to as litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as the former; in this matter of our <hi>Iustification.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
we haue touched vpon that distinction and shewed
the vanitie thereof, in limiting <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul</hi> to workes done
without grace, when simplie he concludes all workes from
our <hi>Iustification.</hi> And <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iames</hi> though he require workes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14751:91"/>
of grace to be ioyned with that <hi>Faith</hi> which must justifie vs:
yet he giues them not that place and office in our Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from which <hi>Paul</hi> doth exclude them, and wherein our
adversaries would establish them, as it shall appeare anon.</p>
                  <p>Leauing then this <hi>sophisticall reconcilement</hi> coined by our
aduersaries I come to those <hi>reconciliations</hi> which are made
by our diuines; wherein we shall haue better <hi>satisfaction</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
better <hi>grounds.</hi> Two waies there are whereby this
seeming difference is by our <hi>Men reconciled.</hi>

                     </gap>

                  </p>
                  <p>This distinction is certaine and hath its ground in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which vseth the word <hi>Iustifie</hi> in both acceptions, for
the quitting of vs in <hi>Gods</hi> sight, and for the manifestation
of our innocency before man against accusation or suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faultines. They applie this distinction for the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
of the two <hi>Apostles.</hi> Thus. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
(in foro Dei) S. Iames</hi> speakes of Iustification (<hi>in
foro hominis</hi>) <hi>A man is justified by faith without workes</hi> saieth
S. <hi>Paul:</hi> that is in God's sight, a man obtaines <hi>remission of
Sinnes</hi> and is reputed just only for his <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> not
for his workes sake. <hi>A man is justified by workes; and not by
Faith onely</hi> saieth S. <hi>Iames</hi> that is, in mans sight we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be just by our good workes, not by our Faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
which with other inward and invisible Graces, are
made visible vnto man onely in the good workes, which
they see vs performe. That this application is not vnfit for
to reconcile this difference, may be shewed by the parts.</p>
                  <p>1. For <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ti's agreed on all sides that he speakes
of mans iustification in God's sight. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. v. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. For <hi>S. Iames</hi> we are to shew that with just probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
he may be vnderstood of the declaration of our <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
and righteousnes before men. For proofe whereof
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14751:91"/>
the Text affords vs these reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. Verse. 18. <hi>Shew me thy Faith without thy Workes and
I will shew thee my Faith by my workes.</hi> Where the true <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi>
speaking to the <hi>Hypocriticall</hi> boaster of his Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of him a declaration of his faith and <hi>Iustification</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
by a reall proofe, not a verball profession, promising
for his part to manifest and approue the trueth of his owne
<hi>Faith</hi> by his good workes. Whence it appeares, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>man,</hi> none can justifie the soundnes of his Faith: but by
his workes thene proceeding. 2. V. 21. <hi>Abraham</hi> is saied
to be justified when he offered vp his sonne <hi>Isaak</hi> vpon the
<hi>Altar.</hi> Now ti's manifest that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified in
Gods sight long before; euen. 25. yeares <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by that admirable worke of his in offering his Sonne he
was declared before all the world to be a just man and a
true Beleeuer. And for this purpose did God tempt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
in that triall of his <hi>Faith:</hi> that thereby all beleeuers,
might behold a rare <hi>patterne</hi> of a liuely and justifying
Faith, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not without good cause cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Father of the <hi>Faithfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. V. 22. It is saied that <hi>Abrahams faith</hi> wrought
with his worke and by workes was his <hi>faith</hi> made perfect.
Which in the iudgement of <hi>popish</hi>

                     <hi>Expositors</hi> themselues, is
to be vnderstood of the manifestation of <hi>Abrahams faith</hi>
by his workes. His Faith directed his workes: his workes
manifested the power and perfection of his Faith.</p>
                  <p>It is not then without good probability of <hi>Reason,</hi> that
<hi>Caluin</hi> and other <hi>Expositors</hi> on our side, haue giuen this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
vnto this doubt.<note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 4 cap. 18.</note> Bellarmine labours against it and

<hi>pro declaratione Iustitiae.</hi> But his Argument cannot much
trouble any intelligent reader, and therefore I spare to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you with his <hi>sophistry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This now is the first way of reconciling the places.
Howbeit the trueth is, that although this may be defended
against any thing that our aduersaries objected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14751:92"/>
yet many and those very learned divines chose rather
to tread in another path and more neerely to presse the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
steps; whom also in this point <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> willingly follow.</p>
                  <p>2 The second way then of reconciling these places, is by
distinguishing of the word (<hi>Faith</hi>) which is taken in a doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
sense.</p>
                  <p>1. First for that <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> which is true and liuing (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Faith which worketh through
loue</hi>) and is fruitfull in all manner of Obedience.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly for that Faith which is <hi>false</hi> and dead, being
onely a bare acknowledgment of the trueth, of all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of <hi>Religion</hi> accompanied with an outward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of <hi>Profession:</hi> but yet destitute of <hi>sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This distinction of this word (<hi>Faith</hi>) is certaine by the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> as hath heretofore bin shewed in handling of that
Grace. Our Men now apply it thus. S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he affirmes
that we are justified by <hi>Faith</hi> onely, speakes of that Faith
which is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>liuing</hi> working by <hi>Charity. S. Iames</hi> when
he denies a Man is justified by Faith only, he disputes against
that <hi>Faith</hi> which is false and <hi>dead,</hi> without power to bring
forth any good workes. So that the <hi>Apostles</hi> speake no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,</hi>
where <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth we are iustified by a true
<hi>Faith,</hi> and S. <hi>Iames</hi> affirmes we are not justified by a false
<hi>Faith.</hi> Againe S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith we are not iustified by workes.
S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith we are justified by Workes. Neither is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>contradiction</hi> at all. For S. <hi>Iames</hi> vnderstands by <hi>Workes,</hi>
a (<hi>working Faith</hi>) in opposition to the idle and dead Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-spoken
of (<hi>by a Metonymie of the Effect.</hi>) Whence it
is plaine that these two <hi>Propositions (Wee are not iustified by
Workes</hi>) which is <hi>Pauls,</hi> and (<hi>We are iustified by a working
Faith</hi>) which is <hi>Iames,</hi> doe sweetly consort together. <hi>Paul</hi>
seuers Works from our <hi>Iustification,</hi> but not from our <hi>Faith.
Iames</hi> ioyned Workes to our <hi>Faith,</hi> but not to our <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
To make this a litle plainer by a <hi>similitude</hi> or twaine:
There is great difference betweene these two sayings, (<hi>A
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14751:92"/>
Man liues by a Reasonable soule</hi>) and (<hi>A Man liues by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>)
The former is true, and shewes vs what <hi>qualities</hi> and
power are <hi>ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ntiall</hi> vnto that <hi>soule,</hi> whereby a Man liues. But
the later is false, because we liue not by the <hi>quality,</hi> or <hi>power</hi>
of <hi>Reason,</hi> though we liue by that <hi>soule</hi> which hath that <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
necessarily belonging to it, without which it is no <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
soule.</hi> So also in these <hi>Propositions,</hi> (<hi>Planta vivit per ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
auctricem</hi>) and (<hi>Planta vivit per augmentationem</hi>)
each <hi>Puny</hi> can tell that the former is true, and the other false.
For although in the <hi>Vegetatiue soule</hi> whereby <hi>Plants</hi> liue,
there be necessarilie required to the (<hi>Being</hi>) of it, those 3 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of <hi>Nourishment, Growth,</hi> and <hi>Procreation:</hi> yet it is not
the <hi>facultie</hi> of <hi>growing</hi> that giues <hi>life</hi> vnto <hi>Plants,</hi> for they
liue when they grow not. In like manner. These two <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi>
(<hi>we are iustified by a working Faith</hi>) &amp; (<hi>We are iustified
by Workes</hi>) differ much. The first is true, and shewes vnto
vs what <hi>qualities</hi> are necessarilie required vnto the (<hi>Being</hi>) of
that <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby the Iust shall liue. Namely, that beside
the power of <hi>beleeuing</hi> in the <hi>Promise,</hi> there be also an <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Pronnesse</hi> and <hi>Resolution</hi> vnto the doing of all good
<hi>Workes,</hi> joined with it. But the later <hi>Proposition</hi> is false. For
although true <hi>Faith</hi> be equallie as apt to worke in bringing
forth <hi>Vniuersall Obedience to God's will;</hi> as it is apt to beleeue
and trust perfectlie vnto God's promises: yet neuerthelesse
we are not justified by it as it brings forth good Workes;
but as it embraceth the <hi>promises</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Now then
<hi>Iames</hi> affirmes that which is true, that (<hi>We are iustified by a
working Faith,</hi>) and S. <hi>Paul</hi> denies that which is false: viz.
(<hi>That we are iustified by workes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The second is touching the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the word
(<hi>Workes</hi>) vsed by S. <hi>Iames</hi> when he saith, (<hi>We are iustified by

for the <hi>Cause,</hi> We are justified by a <hi>working Faith,</hi> by that
<hi>Faith</hi> which is apt to declare and shew it selfe in all good

20) Which in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time vnder pretence of <hi>Religion</hi>
thought they might liue as they list. Two extremes there
were, whereunto these <hi>Iewes,</hi> to whom the <hi>Apostle</hi> writes,
were mis-led by false teachers and their own <hi>corruptions.</hi> The
1. That notwithstanding <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ;</hi> they were bound
to fulfill the whole Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> Against which <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
in his Epistle to the <hi>Gal.</hi> who also were infected with
that Leven. The other was, that <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
without any regard of Obedience, to the Law: so they
beleeued the <hi>Gospell,</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
for true, &amp; made an outward <hi>profession</hi> all should be well,
albeit in the meane Time Sanctitie and <hi>syncere</hi> Obedience
were quite neglected. The former Errour brought them in
Bondage: this made them licentious pleasing <hi>haeresie</hi> if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, whereof there were and will be alwayes store of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries</hi>
who content themselues to haue a forme of <hi>Godlines,</hi>
but deny the power thereof. Against such <hi>hypocrites</hi> &amp; vain
Boasters of false <hi>Faith</hi> and false <hi>Religion,</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> disputes in
this place, shewing plainly that such men leaned on a staffe
of <hi>Reed,</hi> deceiuing their owne selues with a <hi>counterfeit</hi> &amp; sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of true <hi>Christian Faith</hi> insteed of the <hi>substance.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
with the maine <hi>Reason</hi> is expressed by way of <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation</hi>
in the (14. v.) <hi>What doth it profit my Brethren,
though a Man say he haue</hi> (as many then did, and alwaies
will say, boasting falselie of that which they haue not in
truth,) <hi>And haue not workes;</hi> that is, Obedience to God's
Will, whereby to approue that <hi>Faith</hi> he boasts of? Can
that <hi>Faith saue him?</hi> so that Faith vvithout Workes a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

<hi>Reason of it.</hi> The<note n="1" place="margin">Arg. of S. Iames.</note> is this. <hi>Faith without Obedience is vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</hi>
The second prouing the first, is this. <hi>Faith without O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
will not saue a Man.</hi> The vvhole <hi>Argument</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>That Faith which will not saue a man is vnprofitable, of

That a Faith without workes will not doe that? <hi>though it scarse

                  <p>That Faith which saues a Man is a true Faith.</p>
                  <p>But a Faith without workes is not a true Faith. Ergo</p>

Charity <hi>tovvards the poore. The</hi> Argument <hi>is thus. If</hi> Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

counterfeit, then Faith in God professed in like manner without
Obedience is also counterfeite not true. But Charity towards
the poore in words professed without deeds is a counterfeit Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Ergo, Faith in God without Obedience is a counterfeit and
false Faith.</p>
                  <p>The Reason of the <hi>maior Proposition</hi> is euident, from the

this counterfeiting in any kind, and that is to goe
from words to workes, from praesumptions and boastings
to actions. This way all count most certaine, nor will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14751:94"/>
his doeings confute his sayings. Wherefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> in
his comparison proceedes on an vndeniable ground. Now
for the <hi>minor</hi> (<hi>that the Charity which is rich in good words,
and poore in almesdeeds, is not true but counterfeit pitty</hi>) the
<hi>Apostle</hi> shewes by an ordinary instance (<hi>If a brother or sister
be naked, and destitute of daily food</hi>) that is. If a beleiuing
<hi>Christian</hi> want food and raiment or other necessaries (<hi>and
one of you say vnto them, depart in peace, and be ye warmed and

and wish thee well, I Would I had to giue thee, goe in God's
name where thou mayest be releiued,</hi> and so let him passe with
a few pittifull <hi>Complements, notwithstanding yee giue them

a man persuade any that he hath in him indeed the <hi>bowells</hi>
of mercie and compassion towards the needy, when they
find such cold entertainment at his Gates: 'Tis manifest
that this is but a meere mockery, and that such pittifull
words come not from a heart that's truely mercifull. The
<hi>Apostle</hi> now applies this touching <hi>Charity,</hi> vnto <hi>Faith.</hi>
v. 17. <hi>Euen so Faith if it haue not workes is dead being alone.</hi>
As that <hi>Charity,</hi> so also that <hi>Faith</hi> which men professe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Obedience is false and fained, and therefore vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to saue a man. <hi>It is dead:</hi> How must this be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood?
<hi>Faith</hi> is a quality of the soule, and qualities are then
saide to be dead, when they are extinguished. As if we
should say such a man's <hi>Charity</hi> is dead; it is because he hath
lost it; that which was in him is abolished. But this is not
the meaning. For then when <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iames</hi> saieth <hi>that Faith
is dead being alone:</hi> his meaning should be that <hi>Faith seuered
from workes, is no Faith at all: but quite extinguished.</hi> Now
this is not so. For there's a <hi>Faith</hi> seuered from workes in
<hi>Hypocrites, Haeretiques, Reprobates</hi> and <hi>Deuills.</hi> Which
<hi>Faith</hi> is a generall assent to all diuine truthes: and this <hi>Faith</hi>
in them hath a true being, but no sauing vse. Wherefore.

These fond <hi>speculations</hi> of the <hi>Forme</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> I

that which they say. That a liuing Faith, and a dead
<hi>Faith</hi> is one and the same true <hi>Faith:</hi> 'tis vtterly false, they
differ asmuch as Light and Darknes. 1. In their subject. a
dead Faith is in the <hi>Reprobate Men</hi> and <hi>Deuills. A liuing
Faith</hi> only in the <hi>Elect. 2. In</hi> their <hi>Object.</hi> A dead <hi>Faith</hi>
assents to diuine <hi>Reuelations</hi> as barely true or good onely
in the <hi>generall:</hi> a liuing <hi>Faith</hi> assents to them, as truer and
better in themselues; then any thing that can be set against
them. 3, in their Nature. A dead Faith is no sanctifying
Grace: but a common gift of Creation as in the deuill; of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
illumination as in <hi>Reprobate Men.</hi> A liuing <hi>Faith</hi> is a
sanctifying Grace, a part of inhaerent holines wrought in
the heart by the speciall power of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> All which
haue bin heeretofore cleared in handling the <hi>Nature</hi> of
<hi>Faith.</hi> Wherefore vnto those <hi>arguments</hi> or <hi>Sophismes</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                     <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armine</hi> brings to proue that <hi>Iames</hi> speakes
of a true <hi>diuine, infused, Catholique, Christian</hi> Faith, though
it be dead faith; I answere breifely. That we grant a dead
Faith to be a true Faith: but it is in its kind. Because it hath
a true being in men and deuils, in whom it is, and ti's direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward true objects: But it is not that true <hi>Faith</hi> which
is <hi>Catholique Christian</hi> &amp; <hi>sauing.</hi> This is of another kind, and
in comparison of this, that other is but a meere <hi>shadow</hi> and

those <hi>Hypocrites</hi> accounted themselues to haue that <hi>faith</hi>
which is truely <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>sauing, S. Iames</hi> shewes them,
that this their <hi>faith</hi> which was alone naked of Obedience,
was nothing so: but a <hi>Faith</hi> of another kind, a dead <hi>faith,</hi>
hauing onely a false shew of a true and liuing <hi>faith.</hi> This
of the first Argument.</p>

from an impossibility, in prouing the trueth of it. The
Argument stands thus.</p>
                  <p>That Faith, which is truely Christian may be shewen and
proued so to be.</p>
                  <p>But a Faith without workes cannot be demonstrated to be
a true faith.</p>
                  <p>Ergo. A Faith without workes is no true Faith.</p>
                  <p>The major is omitted as most euident of itselfe. Because
there is no <hi>morall</hi> vertue, or grace of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> truely
planted in the heart: but it may be knowne by some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Actions, which it is apt to bring forth. Euen as life
is knowne by breathing, or beating of the <hi>Pulse.</hi> The
trueth of an inuisible Grace hath it's demonstration in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
workes. But now for the <hi>Minor, S. Iames</hi> proues that
<hi>Faith</hi> without Obedience cannot appeare by any proofe to
be true <hi>faith.</hi> Which he doth in a <hi>Dialogue</hi> betweene a

false and fraudulent hearts laied open. But heere it will
be asked what workes doe demonstrate the trueth of <hi>faith,</hi>
and also how they doe proue it. Whereto wee answere
Workes are of two sortes. 1. <hi>Ordinary,</hi> such workes of
<hi>Sanctity</hi> &amp; <hi>Obedience,</hi> as are required to a holy <hi>Conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
2. <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> viz, <hi>Miracles.</hi> We say S. <hi>Iames</hi>
vnderstands the former, and those onely: our aduersaries
conclude both. But erroneously, for asmuch as <hi>S. Iames</hi>
speakes not of the doctrine of <hi>faith,</hi> but of the <hi>Grace</hi> of
<hi>faith.</hi> The Grace requires good workes of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
as perpetually necessary for the conmirmation of it's
Trueth. So doeth not the doctrine of Faith alwaies
require <hi>Miraculous workes</hi> for the confirmation of it's
divinity: But oney at the first <hi>publication</hi> thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Lorinus</hi> is very <hi>ridiculous,</hi> who vpon this place
tels vs, that they may justly demaund of vs <hi>Haeretiques</hi>
(For so they bedust vs) <hi>Miracles</hi> for the confirmation
of our new and false Doctrine. Indeed were it new and
false their request were not vnreasonable, that we should
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14751:96"/>
make our doctrine credible by doing of <hi>Miracles.</hi> But sure
the <hi>Iesuite</hi> iudgeth of our doctrine by his ovvne, vvhich
did he not suspect for a nevv Error, vvee see no reason they
should still require <hi>Miracles</hi> for confirmation of an olde
Truth For our selues we seeke not the aide of a lying Wonder
to vphold a true doctrine: nor doe we count it any disgrace
at all to our <hi>Religion,</hi> that we cannot by our <hi>Faith</hi> so much
as cure a lame Horse, as the <hi>Iesuite</hi> out of<note n="a" place="margin">De lib. arbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Erasmus</hi> scoffes
at vs. Now surely if such a beast as <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> deuout
Mare, want helpe to set her on all foure, we cannot be yet so
well perswaded of that vertue of <hi>Romish Faith,</hi> as to thinke
that a <hi>Frier</hi> will doe more good at such a jadish miracle, then
a <hi>Farrier.</hi> But whereas the <hi>Iesuite</hi> goes forward to require of
vs the other sort of good workes, of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> for
the demonstration of our <hi>Faith</hi> hee hath reason so to doe,
though not so much as he imagines, when hee chargeth vs
with neglect of good Workes and vnbridled licentiousnesse.
Would to God we could cleere our practise from such neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
as well as we can our doctrine from teaching it. But yet,
by their fauour, if we come to comparisons, we know no
Reason why we should runne behind the dore, as more asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of our practises, then they may justly be of theirs, in
which case we boldly bid him amongst them; that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sinne to cast the first stone at vs. To proceed. Seeing
Workes of Obedience are the <hi>proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s</hi> of a true <hi>Faith,</hi> it must
be considered in what sort they proue it. For may not good
Workes be counterfeited as well as Faith? I answere. That
in this triall the judgment of <hi>verity</hi> &amp; <hi>infallibility</hi> belongeth
vnto God, who only knowes the heart and conscience, being
able to discerne euery secret working of the <hi>Soule,</hi> and so to
judge exactly whether or no all outward appearances come
from inward <hi>syncerity.</hi> But for the judgement of <hi>Charity</hi> that
belongs to vs. If we behold in any man the Workes of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to God's will; of such a Man we are to judge that
he hath true <hi>Faith.</hi> Though yet herein we must as farre as
humane frailtie will giue leaue, iudge also not according to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14751:97"/>
appearance, but iudge righteous iudgment. Mens practises
must be examined: if <hi>hypocrisie</hi> bewray it self, (as 'tis hard for
a <hi>Counterfeit</hi> not to forget himself at <hi>some</hi> one time or other,
if he be duly obserued) there <hi>Charity</hi> must not be blinde: it
must see and censure it. 'Tis not a charitable, but a peruerse
Iudgment to call euill good: nor is it any offence to call that
a barren or bad Tree, that beares either no fruit at all, or none
but bad; And thus of this second <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi>
that these <hi>Hypocrites Faith</hi> was vaine, because, when it comes

themselues, in whom there is a <hi>Faith</hi> without Workes,

<hi>Faith.</hi> The Argument is brought in to confute a <hi>Cauill</hi>
with the <hi>hypocrite</hi> might make against the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
True might he say, I cannot shew my <hi>Faith</hi> by my
Workes: yet for all that I haue a true Faith. And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I beleeue the Articles of <hi>Religion,</hi> that there is one
God, with the rest. Hereto the <hi>Apostle</hi> replies. That such a
beliefe is not a true <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> because it is to be found
euen in the diuels. The Argument runnes thus.</p>
                  <p>That faith which is in the diuels is no true Christian
faith.</p>
                  <p>But a bare assent to the Articles of Religion without O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is in the Diuels. Ergo</p>
                  <p>A bare assent without Obedience is no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> of this <hi>Argument</hi> will easily be granted. That
the diuels haue not that true Faith which is required of a
<hi>Christian</hi> Man to his saluation. The <hi>Minor</hi> is also euident.
That the diuels doe belieue the Articles of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
S. <hi>Iames</hi> instances in one for the rest, namely the <hi>Article</hi> of
the <hi>Godhead,</hi> whereto the Diuels assent aswell as <hi>Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Men. Thou beleeuest that there is one God,</hi> saith the true
beleeuer to the <hi>hypocrite,</hi> pleading that he beleeued the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of <hi>Faith, Thou doest well.</hi> 'Tis a laudable and good thing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14751:97"/>
to acknowledge the Truth of <hi>Religion.</hi> But vvithall thou
must knovv that the diuels deserue as much commendation
for this beleefe, as thou doest. <hi>The diuels also beleeue.</hi> Euen
they confesse the Truth of that and the other <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
An euident proofe vvhereof is this, that <hi>they tremble</hi>
at the povver, vvrath, and iustice of God, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the last iudgment, vvhich did they not beleeue, they
vvould not feare: but novv they expect it vvith Horrour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knovv it vvill come vpon them. Whence 'tis plain
that the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and diuels is all one, neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then other, both vnfruitfull to bring forth Obedience,
both vnprofitable to bring vnto saluation, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them that true Faith, vvhich is <hi>Christian</hi> and sauing.
This Argument of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> pincheth our Aduersaries
sore, vvho stiffly maintaine that S. <hi>Iames</hi> speakes of a True,
though of a dead Faith. For they can not for shame say that
there is a true <hi>Faith</hi> in the diuels and damned <hi>Spirits.</hi> But
yet S. <hi>Iames</hi> hath concluded that they haue that dead <hi>Faith</hi>
which <hi>hypocrites</hi> boast of. What then? Then a dead <hi>Faith</hi> is
no true faith, as our<note n="a" place="margin">Bell. lib. 1. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

helpe themselues, they deny that it is one and the same dead
<hi>Faith,</hi> which is in hypocrites and euill <hi>Spirits.</hi> Indeed <hi>ex parte
obiecti,</hi> they grant that the <hi>Faith</hi> of diuels is as true and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi>
as that of wicked Men, because they both beleeue the
the same things. And also in regard of the <hi>effects,</hi> they grant
their Faith to be alike, because both be vnfruitfull. But not <hi>ex
parte subiecti,</hi> so they say there's much difference. The Faith
of diuels is of one sort, and the Faith of <hi>hypocrites</hi> of another.
But heere they make a litle to bold with the blessed <hi>Apostle,</hi>
ouerturning the force of his argument, to vphold their
owne fancie. The Apostle proues against <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that
their idle <hi>Faith</hi> without Obedience is not true sauing <hi>Faith.</hi>
Why? Because the diuel's idle Faith destitute of Obedience
is no true sauing Faith. But now. Is the Faith of diuels &amp; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
of the same kinde and Nature. Yea, or no? No, they
be not, they be of a diuerse nature, say the Adversaries. Let it
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14751:98"/>
be then considered, what force there is in the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Faith without workes in Deuils saues them not. Ergo
Faith without workes in wicked Men, saues them not.</hi> Might
not one prompted by a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> reply vpon the <hi>Apostle.</hi> Nay
by your leaue, your Argument is inconsequent, because you
doe not dispute, <hi>ad idem.</hi> Faith in the diuels is of one kinde,
Faith in Hypocrites is of another: &amp; therefore though Faith
without works cannot saue diuels; yet Faith without works
may saue Men. Thus were the Apostle's Argument laide in
the dust, if these Mens Opinions may stand for good. But
would you know what distinction these Men make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the faith of diuels and wicked Men, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Iames</hi>

Wicked Men beleeue freely and willingly. Why? Because
their pious and godly Will captiuates their vnderstanding
to the Obedience of <hi>Christ,</hi> so causing it to assent vnto the
Truth. The diuels beleeue vpon compulsion, being forced
to it by the Euidence of the things themselues. Which Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> intimates, <hi>They beleeue and tremble:</hi> that is, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
against their Wills. Is not this a shamelesse <hi>Iesuite</hi>
that will say any thing to patch vp a broken cause? For be
not these absurd Contradictions to say, that wicked Men
haue godly Wills, that by a pious Motion of the Will, their
vnderstanding is captiuated to the Obedience of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
yet they be <hi>hypocrites</hi> and wicked Men still. No Man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
such assertions, who knowes how averse and fromward
the will of Men is to embrace any thing that is of God, till
such time as it be regenerate by sanctifying Grace. It is
therefore without all reason, to affirme that wicked Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14751:98"/>
willinglie, and 'tis against all experience, which shewes
that vngodly Men are vtterly as vnwilling to beleue any truth
that makes against them in any kinde whatsoeuer; as a <hi>beare</hi>
is to be brought to the <hi>stake.</hi> Indeed in matters that like them,
or such as be of an indifferent Nature, neither fauouring nor
crossing their Corruptions, they'll be apt to beleeue, though
not out of a pious affection, as the <hi>Iesuite</hi> dreames: but out
of selfe-loue and other <hi>selfe-considerations.</hi> But take them
in any other point of <hi>Religion,</hi> that doth any way grate vpon
their wicked affections, all the perswasion and instruction
in the World, cannot worke them to a beleefe of it, till the
<hi>Conscience</hi> (spite of their hearts) be convicted by some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Euidence of the Trueth. Now what else can be said of
the diuels; who will as willinglie beleeue what makes for
them, (if any thing did) or what makes not against them; as
any wicked man can doe? And they are as vnwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
any thing, that makes against them, as any wicked Man
is. Nor would they beleeue it, did not the cleerenes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<hi>Reuelations</hi> convince them of the certaine Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
So that there is no difference at all in this respect, as the
one, so the other beleeue vnwillingly; as diuels, so wicked
Men beleeue with trembling. The diuels indeed with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
horror, as their beleefe and knowledge is alwaies more
distinct then Mans: but yet Men with horror too, when their
Consciences by fits are awakened to behold the woes, that
are comming vpon them. Vnto this difference of<note n="c" place="margin">Becanus.</note>

is naturall; that of wicked Men supernaturall and infused.</hi>
2 <hi>That the Faith of Diuels is dishonest, the Faith of wicked
Men is an honest Faith.</hi> Whereto we say thus much. That
touching the first difference, we grant indeed that the <hi>Faith</hi>
of the diuels is not <hi>supernaturall</hi> except it be in regard of the
<hi>obiect.</hi> The faculties which they receiued in their creation are
not so farre corrupted in them: but that they are able to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

vnto the vngodly; but this is by ordinary illumination,
not by speciall infusion of any sanctifying Grace. Enlightned
they are aboue the ordinary pitch of naturall blindnes: but
not aboue that whereto a meere naturall vnderstanding may
be aduanced. Yea were Mans Vnderstanding raised vp to
that perfection which is in diuels: this were more then Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet lesse then Grace. This common gift of Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bestowed on wicked Men, but not on diuels, is no proofe
that their Faith is of a diuerse kinde. As to the last difference
we are not so far studied in Moralities, as to conceiue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the dishonestie of the diuel's Faith, and the honestie of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites

all those strong temptations to disobedience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
made it appeare, that his faith was not an idle, dead

Wherefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> adds ver. 22. <hi>Seest thou how faith

That is as in other workes of that holy <hi>Patriarch,</hi> so spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

by the strength of his Faith had done many excellent workes
and obtained great blessings at the hand of God. So that
the offering vp of <hi>Isaack</hi> was not the cause but a fruite of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14751:100"/>
the perfection of <hi>Abrahams Faith,</hi> the great difficulty of that

was able so to encounter and conquer it. The goodnes of

                  </p>
                  <p>The next part. Namely. <hi>That Abraham was justified in

Both are expressed in the 23. v. The first in these words.
<hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled which sayeth. Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
God, and it was imputed vnto him for Righteousnes.</hi>
The application of this testimony is very heedfully to be
obserued, because it serues excellently for the clearing of
the <hi>Apostles</hi> meaning, when he saieth we are justified by
workes. <hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled</hi> saieth S. <hi>Iames.</hi>
When? At the time, that <hi>Isaack</hi> was offered. But was it
not fulfilled before that time? Yes. Many yeares, when
the <hi>promise</hi> of the <hi>blessed seed</hi> was made vnto him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. Whence this testimony is taken. How
was it then fulfilled at the oblation of <hi>Isaack?</hi> Thus. The
Trueth of that which was verified before, was then againe
confirmed by a new and euident experiment. Well. Thus
much is plaine enough. But heere now the difficulty is,
how this Scripture is applyed vnto the <hi>Apostles</hi> former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
In the 21. v. He saieth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Workes when he offered <hi>Isaack.</hi> How proues he, that
he was so justified? why by this testimony. Because the
Scripture was fulfil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed at that time, which saieth, <hi>Abraham
beleeued God</hi> &amp;c. Marke then the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Argument.

farre set, and not onely besides, but quite contrary to the
<hi>Apostles</hi> purpose to proue he was then justified by workes,
because the Scripture saieth, he was then iustified by <hi>Faith.</hi>
But vpon due consideration, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erence appeares to be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and the agreement easie. The <hi>Apostle</hi> and the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
alleaged, haue one and the same meaning: the Scripture
saieth. He was iustified by <hi>Faith,</hi> meaning, as all confesse,
a working <hi>Faith</hi> fruitefull in <hi>Obedience.</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> affirmes
the very same, saying, that he was justified by workes, that
is. <hi>Metonymically</hi> by a working <hi>Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And therefore the
<hi>Apostle</hi> rightly alleageth the Scripture for confirmation of
his assertion: the Scripture witnessing. <hi>That by Faith he
was iustified;</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> expounding what manner of <hi>Faith</hi>
it meanes. Namely a Faith with workes or a working <hi>Faith.</hi>
So that the <hi>application</hi> of this Testimony vnto that time of
offering vp of <hi>Isaack</hi> is most excellent: because then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
manifestly what manner of <hi>Faith</hi> it was, wherefore
God had accounted him just in former times. Without
this <hi>Metonymie</hi> it appeares not that there is any force in
the application of this Scripture and the Argument from
thence. The Scripture witnesseth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was then
justified by Faith. <hi>Ergo</hi> 'tis true, that he was then justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Workes. What <hi>consequence</hi> is there in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
except we expound S. <hi>Iames</hi> by that <hi>metonymie,</hi>
Workes, that is a working <hi>Faith?</hi> And so the Argument
holdes firme. Take it otherwise, as our aduersaries would
haue it, or, to speake trueth, according to the former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of our diuines; it breeds an absurd construction
either way. <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering <hi>Isaack</hi> was justified by
workes, that is, <hi>secundâ Iustificatione</hi> of good he was made
better. How is that proued? By Scripture. Because the
<hi>Scripture saieth.</hi> That at that time he was justified by faith.
That is, <hi>primâ Iustificatione</hi> of bad he became good. Is not
this most apparent <hi>Non-sence.</hi> Againe according to the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:14751:101"/>
Interpretations of our diuines, <hi>Abraham</hi> at the offering vp
of <hi>Isaack</hi> was iustified by workes (that is, say they) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
iust before men. How is that proued? by Scripture.
Because the Scripture saieth. That at that time, he was
justified by Faith. that is, accounted just in God's sight.
In which kind of arguing I must confesse I apprehend not
how there is any tolerable consequence. Wherefore we
expound <hi>S. Iames metonymically,</hi> putting the <hi>effect</hi> for the
<hi>cause;</hi> workes, for a working Faith, as the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of the text enforced vs. Nor is there any harshnes
at all, nor violent straining in this figure, when two things
of necessary and neere dependance one vpon the other, (<hi>as
workes, and a working Faith</hi>) are put one for another. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue our aduersaries more cause to complaine of vs for
this figuratiue interpretation of workes, then we haue of
them for their figuratiue interpretation of faith. For when
we are saied to be justified by <hi>faith,</hi> they vnderstand it <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positiuè
&amp; meritoriè</hi> not <hi>formaliterè Faith</hi> in itselfe is not our
sanctification, nor yet the cause of it. But it merits the
bestowing of it, and disposeth vs to receaue it. Let reason
iudge now, which is the harsher exposition. Theirs? <hi>faith
iustifies</hi> (that is) <hi>Faith is a disposition in vs deseruing that
God should sanctifie vs by infusion of the habit of Charity.</hi> Or
ours? <hi>Workes justifie,</hi> that is, <hi>the Faith whereby we are acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in God's sight, is a working Faith.</hi> Thus much of this

That a man is iustified by a working faith: not by a faith
without workes. Which <hi>Metonymicall</hi> interpretation is
againe confirmed by the inference of this conclusion vpon
the former verse. The Scripture saieth, <hi>That Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued

(saieth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wee see the contrary. That a man is iustified by
faith onely and not by workes. For in that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there is no mention at all made of Workes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of necessity we must vnderstand them both in the same
sense. And so the conclusion followes directly. That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man is iustified by an actiue not an idle Faith, because
the Scripture witnesseth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was instified by the
like Faith. Our Aduersaries collection then from this place.

and faith are two Coordinate causes by their ioynt-force-working
our Iustification; but the <hi>Apostle</hi> vtterly excludes

workes. For by <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> goes forward from the Example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

plainly that she had a strong and liuely <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>God</hi> of

from a truely beleeuing heart, insomuch as her words

the <hi>Apostle</hi> iustly parallels these 2 examples of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
offering his sonne; and <hi>Rahab</hi> in the kind vsage of
the <hi>Spies,</hi> because both those facts were singular trialls of a
liuely faith which was able in that sorte to ouercome what
was hardest to be conquered. viz. Naturall affection. In
<hi>Abraham</hi> both fatherly affection to the life of a deere and
only sonne: and in <hi>Rahab</hi> the Naturall loue to ones Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

                     <hi>speculations</hi> telling vs, that now the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath altered his
cliffe, and gone from the second Iustification in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
example, to the first Iustification in this of <hi>Rahab.</hi> That
<hi>Rahab</hi> was conuerted at this time of receauing the <hi>spies</hi>

that she committed a <hi>venial sinne</hi> in handling

should not haue done; yet it hindred not the meritoriousnes
of the worke, with such other fond imaginations peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the simplicity of the Trueth. But first they are not
agreed among themselues whether the <hi>Apostle</hi> doe in that

it and many moe. But others deny it, as may be
seene in <hi>Lorinus</hi> his exposition of the. 21. v. of this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
And were they agreed vpon it, sure I am they should
disagree from the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who makes this second instance
of the same nature with the former. <gap reason="foreign">

Againe when they say <hi>Rahab</hi> became a true beleeuer at that
time of receauing the <hi>spies,</hi> not before, 'tis more then they
can proue. By the circumstances of the story it appeares
plainely, that she beleeued before they came, by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the great workes which God had done for his <hi>people,</hi>
and the promises that were made vnto them, that they
should possesse <hi>Rahabs</hi> countrey. This bred feare in others:

v. 20. Now for a close of this whole dispute he againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peates
that conclusion, adding thereto anew similitude to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
it by, in the last verse of the Chapter. <hi>For as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
without the Spirit is dead, so faith without workes is dead,</hi>
that is, <hi>As the Body without the Spirit,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Souls,</hi> or the
<hi>Breath</hi> and other <hi>Motion (is dead) vnable</hi> to performe any
liuing action whatsoeuer: <hi>So Faith without workes is dead;</hi>
that is, vtterly vnable to performe these liuing actions, which
belong vnto it. What are those? Two. 1. To repose it sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
vpon the promise of life in <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the proper
immediate liuing Action of <hi>Faith.</hi> 2. To justifie a Man
in the sight of God, which by a speciall priuiledge is the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent</hi>
of the former. These liuing actions cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by that <hi>Faith</hi> which is dead, being destitute of good
workes. That <hi>Faith</hi> which hath not power to bring forth O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
is thereby declared to be a dead Faith, deuoide of
all power to embrace the promise with confidence and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as also to justifie. A Man would thinke this were plaine
enough, and needed not to be troubled with any further C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>
besides the purpose of the Text. The Apostle intends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14751:104"/>
but to shew the <hi>Necessity</hi> of the <hi>Copulation</hi> of a liuing
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> together: by the similitude of the like
Necessitie of the <hi>vnion</hi> of a liuing Body, and the Soule. But
his purpose is not to shew, that the manner of their <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is the same, that just in euery point as the Soule is to the
Body, or the Body to the Soule: so Workes are vnto Faith,
and Faith vnto Works. It sufficeth to his intent, that as in the
absence of the Soule, the Body: so in the absence of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Faith is dead. But thence it followes not, that
workes by their presence doe the same thing to <hi>Faith;</hi> as the
Soule to the Body by it's presence; or that Faith in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Workes remaines the same; as the Body doth in the
absence of the Soule. If we must needs be tied to the strict
termes of the Similitude: let vs a little examine the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and we shall see our Aduersaries all flye off first from it.
Let the comparison be first thus. Betweene the Body and
the Soule, Faith and Workes as the termes be in the Text. As the Body without the Soule is dead because the Soule giues
life, <hi>i.e sense, breathing, and all other Motion to the Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Faith without Workes is dead, because Workes giue life
vnto Faith.</p>
                  <p>But now this <hi>Comparison</hi> will not runne on all foure.
For <hi>Workes</hi> are not vnto <hi>Faith</hi> as the <hi>Soule</hi> is to the <hi>Body;</hi> but
as sense and motion is to the Body. Seeing Workes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
acts, not internall habits: and so are proportionable
not to the <hi>Soule,</hi> but to the liuing actions thence issuing.
Wherefore 'tis as absurd to say, that Workes giue life vnto
<hi>Faith,</hi> as 'tis ridiculous to affirme, that <hi>Sense</hi> &amp; <hi>Motion</hi> giue
life to the Body, which are not Causes; but Effects &amp; signes
of Life. Therefore when Faith without Workes is dead, 'tis
not spoken in that sense, because <hi>Workes</hi> giue life to Faith, as
the <hi>Soule</hi> doth to the Body. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> then the Comparison bee
thus. Between the Body and the Soule. Faith and Charity.</p>
                  <p>As the Body without the Soule is dead, because the Soule
is the forme of the body, and giues life to it.</p>
                  <p>So Faith without Charity is dead, because Charity is the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14751:104"/>
Forme of Faith, and giues life to it.</p>
                  <p>But neither will the Comparison hold vpon these termes.
For 1. our Adversaries here put in <hi>Charity</hi> the habit, for
<hi>Workes</hi> the act: which is more then themselues ought to doe,
seeing they will tye vs at short Bitts, to the very letter of the
Text. For though we can be content to admit that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
would they admit of the <hi>Apostle's</hi> plaine meaning, &amp;
not straine for <hi>querkes:</hi> yet seeing they argue so precisely
from the Words of the Comparison, they must not now
haue libertie from vs to goe from them, but be content to
take the Words as they lie in the Text, and make their best of
them. Yet seeing 'tis most senselesse to make Workes (that
is) externall Actions the <hi>Forme</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> an internall habit:
let them take <hi>Charity</hi> insteed of them, an internall habit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
Wil it be any better now? belike so. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 'tis thus. <hi>As the
Soule is the Forme of the Body: so Charity is the forme of Faith.
and as the Soule giues life and action to the Body, so Charity
vnto Faith.</hi> Will they stand to this? No. Here againe they fly
off in both <hi>Comparisons.</hi> Charity is one habit, Faith another
distinct betweene themselues, and therefore they deny, as
there's good reason, that <hi>Charity</hi> is either the <hi>Essentiall forme</hi>
of Faith, as the Soule of the liuing Body: or the <hi>accidentall
Forme,</hi> as whitenes of <hi>Paper.</hi> They say 'tis onely an <hi>externall
Forme.</hi> But this now is not to keepe close to the <hi>Apostle's</hi>
comparison, but to runne from it at their pleasure, when they
fall vpon an absurdity in pressing of it so strictly. <hi>The Soule is
no externall, but an internall essentiall Forme, &amp; therefore Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
must be so, if all runne round.</hi> Againe doth <hi>Charitie</hi> giue
life or liuing actions vnto <hi>Faith</hi> as the <hi>Soule</hi> doth vnto the
Body? Neither dare they hold close to this <hi>Comparison.</hi> For
the proper worke or action of Faith is to assent vnto the
Trueth of diuine reuelations, because of Gods authoritie, as
themselues teach. Whence now comes this assent? From the
<hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or of <hi>Charity?</hi> They grant that it comes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie
from the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which produceth this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
euen when its seuered from <hi>Charity.</hi> Then 'tis plain that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14751:105"/>
it is not <hi>Charitie</hi> that giues life to <hi>Faith,</hi> which can performe
the proper action that belongs to it, without it's helpe. How
then doth <hi>Charity</hi> giue life vnto <hi>Faith?</hi> For this, they haue a
sillie conceit. <hi>Charity giues Life,</hi> that is <hi>Merite</hi> vnto
<hi>Faith.</hi> The beleefe, or assent vnto diuine Trueth is <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
if it be with <hi>Charity.</hi> If without, then 'tis not <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
This is a fine toy, wherein againe they runne quite from
the <hi>Comparison</hi> of the <hi>Apostle.</hi> For the <hi>Soule</hi> giues liuing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to the Body, not only the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and so <hi>Charitie</hi> is not like the <hi>Soule,</hi> because it giues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>qualification</hi> of <hi>Merit</hi> vnto the Action of Faith, &amp; not
the action it selfe. Beside. A most vaine interpretation it is,
without any ground from Scripture, to say a liuing Faith,
(that is) a <hi>meritorious Faith:</hi> when euen in common sense, the
life of any habit consists onelie in a power to produce those
actions, that naturallie and immediatlie depend vpon that
<hi>Habit.</hi> And what Reason is there in the World why the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi>
of <hi>Charity</hi> should make the actions of <hi>Faith meritorious,</hi>
or, why <hi>Charity</hi> should make <hi>Faith meritorious,</hi> rather then
<hi>Faith</hi> make <hi>Charity meritorious,</hi> seing in this life there is no
such praeeminency of <hi>Charity</hi> aboue <hi>Faith?</hi> Wherefore we
despise these <hi>speculatiue Sophismes,</hi> which with much faire
glozing, our Aduersaries draw from the Text: but yet
when all comes to the Triall, themselues will not stand to
the strict application of the <hi>similitude,</hi> because it breeds ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities,
which euen themselues abhorre. Now if they
take liberty to <hi>qualifie</hi> and <hi>interpret,</hi> they must giue vs leaue
to doe so too, or if they will not we shall take it. To shut
vp all. Their other Collection is as weake as the former:
namely. <hi>A dead body is a true body. ergo a dead Faith is
true Faith.</hi> This Argument forceth the Similitude, and
so is of a <hi>Force.</hi> In materiall things which haue a diuerse
being from different <hi>Causes,</hi> it may hold. But 'tis not so
in Vertues and Graces. Trueth and Life are both <hi>essentiall</hi>
to such <hi>qualities.</hi> True <hi>Charity</hi> is a liuing <hi>Charity</hi> (i. e.)
actiue, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> himselfe proues. v. 15. True Va-

'tis liuing and stirring in Action: if it be otherwise, 'tis coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,

so honest, so just, so pure, so worthy loue and good report:

They will giue him leaue to haue his part: but, by his leaue,
they will haue one share too in satisfying for Sinnes. For
they are a generation of Men that are resolued to be as litle

there be any article of <hi>Religion</hi> wherein Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would giue the honour of all vnto God, they looke at it

and explained at large by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his two bookes <hi>De
Purgatorio</hi> in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Booke <hi>De Poenitentia,</hi> and his Bookes
<hi>De Indulgentijs:</hi> is this. <hi>Sinnes are of two sorts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Sinne committed before Baptisme: as Originall Sinne in
all that are baptized Infants: and actuall sinnes in those
that are baptized at yeares of discretion.</p>
                  <p>2. Sinne committed after Baptisme, when after the Grace
of the holy Ghost receiued in Baptisme; men fall into Sin,
polluting the Temple of God, and grieuing his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Touching the former sort of Sinnes, they are agreed that
Men are freed from them both, the fault and punishment, by
the Merits and satisfaction of <hi>Christ</hi> only without any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
on our part. But now for Sinnes after Baptisme, in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14751:107"/>
obtaining of Remission of them, <hi>Christ</hi> and we part stakes.
Which <hi>copartnership</hi> is declared vnto vs in this manner. <hi>In
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Sinnes</hi> (we must know) <hi>there are three things conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The fault in the offence of God's Maiesty, and violation
of our friendship with him.</hi> Here they grant also, That Man can
not satisfie for the fault, doing any thing that may appease
God's displeasure; and procure his loue. <hi>Christ</hi> onely hath
done this for vs, for whose onely satisfaction. God of his
mercy freely returnes into fauour and friendship with vs.
But this must be vnderstood in a <hi>catholique</hi> sense, viz: for
fault of <hi>Mortall Sinnes;</hi> as for <hi>Veniall Sinnes</hi> God is but
slightly angry with them, and so we may satisfie him for the
fault thereof, both in this life, and in <hi>Purgatory</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The staine or corruption of Sinne, called the Reliques of
Sinne abiding in the Soule. For the purging out of which,
there is great force in such satisfactions, as are made by
Prayers, Fastings, Almesdeed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and other laborious
workes, although the Heretiques say otherwise. <hi>That
the abolishing of inhaerent corruption is by the gift of grace
freely bestowed on vs by degrees, in the vse of all godly
meanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The punishment of Sinne, which after the fault is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
remaines yet to be suffered. For although it be
true that God in some causes doth pardon both fault and
punishment wholy, as in cause of Martyrdome, which
sweepes all cleane, and makes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> yet there's an after reckoning, and we must come
to Coram for the punishment, by which his Iustice is to
receaue satisfaction. But <hi>(ye must know)</hi> the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Sinne is two fold.</p>

Heere now <hi>Christ's</hi> satisfaction comes in againe. By
whose merits alone they grant, we are deliuered from the
<hi>eternity</hi> of the <hi>punishment of Sinne.</hi> Which must be noted,
that <hi>Christ's</hi> satisfaction hath not eased vs of the substance of
the punishment it selfe: but only in the continuance of it.</p>
                  <p>2. Temporall; to endure onely for a time, whereof there are
also two degrees.</p>
                  <p>1. One in this life, as namely all calamities and afflictions
vpon the Body, Soule, Name, Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together
with death the last and greatest of euills. All which
are inflicted vpon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or as death in the wildernes on the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>with

Now here's no remedy but patience, and that's an excellent
remedy too. For (as the ghostly Fathers of</hi> Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

course may be taken, that we need not suffer the punishment
it selfe: but we may buy it out and make satisfaction for it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God by other meanes. <hi>Which meanes are principally
foure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. By the vehemency of Contrition, or inward sorrow.
Which may be so intensiue as to satisfie for all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both in this life and also in Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>2. By other outward laborious workes. Whereby we may
buy out the obligation to temporall punishments. Such
Workes are these.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Praier with Confession, Thankesgiuing.</hi> &amp;c. For, if

Ashes, wearing of haire cloth, whippings, goeing bare-foote

workes of mercy. <hi>These also buy out the punishments of

all such workes as these are either.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Voluntarily vndertaken of our owne accord, as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Pilgrimage, Scourgings, Fastes, Sackloth, Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
and Praiers of such a number and measure,
with the like rough punishments, which we take vpon
our selues to pacifie God. All which being done with
an intent to satisfie for the punishment of our Sinnes;
must needs be accepted of God almighty for good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
because in so doeing, we doe more then he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of our hands. <hi>Now 'tis very pleasing to God
to doe what he bids vs not: or what he bids vs, to doe to
another end of our devising. He therefore that voluntarily
vndertakes such needlesse paines, giues God high</hi> satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>According to the Text.</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 31. If wee
would iudge our selues, we should not be iudged.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Inioyned by the Priest.</hi> Who by <hi>vertue of the Keies
committed vnto him</hi> might iudicially absolue the paenitent
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14751:108"/>
from the whole debt, were it not <hi>thought fit vpon speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations</hi>
to keepe backe a part. Wherefore when he hath
absolued him from the <hi>fault and aeternall punishment,</hi> he
binds him vnto satisfaction for <hi>the temporall punishment,</hi> and
therefore he enjoynes him what he shall doe to buy it out.
Let him goe visit the shrine of such and such a Saint, say so
many <hi>Aues</hi> &amp; <hi>Paternosters</hi> before such an Image, whip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

hath done these things commanded by the <hi>Preist:</hi> then
'tis certaine his sinnes be satisfied for. For 'tis to be noted
that in enioyning this <hi>Canonicall satisfaction,</hi> as 'tis called,
the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>God</hi> almighty be just of the same mind. Looke
how much the <hi>Preist</hi> enioynes for <hi>satisfaction,</hi> God must be

will not be quiet, because, it may be, God expected more

God's, <hi>Iustice,</hi> and redeeme the Temporall punishment
of their sinnes in this life.</p>
                  <p>The other degree of the <hi>temporall punishment</hi> is in the <hi>life
to come,</hi> namely, in <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14751:109"/>
in this Life; but full satisfaction was not made for the
punishment before death. Such must fry awhile in <hi>Purgatory</hi>
longer or shorter time according as their Sinnes are more or
lesse haynous; or as Mens hearts on Earth be more or lesse
pitifull towards them. But howeuer there they must be till
the <hi>Temporall Punishment</hi> of their <hi>Sinnes</hi> be fully suffered: or
bought out by something else that may satisfie God's Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Punishment</hi> of Sinne inflicted in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is
twofold.</p>
                  <p>1. Poena Damni. of Losse (viz.) of the beautifull vision of
God, and ioyes of Heauen.</p>
                  <p>2. Poena sensus. of sense or smart. viz. The bitter paines of
God's wrath sensibly tormenting the Powers of the Soule, infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vpon them either immediatly by God himselfe, or by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of the diuels as his Instruments.</p>
                  <p>For 'tis a doubt not yet resolued among the <hi>Patrons</hi> of
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> whether the Diuels haue not to doe there also as
well as in hell. But whether their Tormentours be Diuels or
not, this is agreed vpon, that the Torment and Punishment
which the Soules do suffer in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is for the Substance
of it the very same with the Torments of Hell, differing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from it in continuance. Those of <hi>Purgatory</hi> be <hi>temporall,</hi>
these of <hi>Hell aeternall.</hi> Well now, such as haue not bestirred
themselues then, well in this Life to make all euen by full <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions,</hi>
such must be arrested in the mid way to Heauen,
and cast into this <hi>Prison.</hi> Out of which two Meanes there
be to be deliuered.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>By suffering all this temporall punishment for so many
yeares and dayes as 'tis to continue.</hi> How many that is, you
must inquire of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Michael,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> knowes not that.
But yet sure shee is, that many <hi>Soules</hi> shall continue in <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi>
till the day of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> so there shallbe the same pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of the World, and of their Torments. These haue a
hard time of it; 'tis easier haply with others. But be it as 'twill
be, such as these pay the vtmost farthing, where they endure
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14751:110"/>
in the flames of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> so long till the time of their whole
punishment be runne out. Then God is satisfied, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>By buying out this punishment by some other satisfactory
price.</hi> For although God could so haue ordered it, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Soule being once in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> should suffer all the
Temporall punishments due: yet he is content to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to commute <hi>poenance,</hi> and take some other valueable
consideration by way of <hi>satisfaction</hi> for this punishment.
But this <hi>satisfactory</hi> payment cannot be made by the Soules
themselues: it must be made by some on Earth for them.
which is done. 1. Either by laborious workes of any one
iust and godly <hi>Catholique,</hi> whether he be a friend of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
or other touched with a charitable pitty toward a
poore soule. Who by store of deuout prayers, Almes, Masses,
Pilgrimages, founding of Coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

procure a <hi>gaole-deliuery</hi> for that soule for which he intends
those good workes. 2. Or by the <hi>Pope</hi> who is purse-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to the <hi>Church,</hi> and hath the Treasurie thereof vnder Lock
and Key. He now, though he cannot directly absolue the
<hi>Soules</hi> in Purgatory from their punishment, as he can Men
liuing on the Earth, yet he may helpe them another way by
bestowing on them so much of the superfluous sufferings of
<hi>Christ</hi> and of the Saints, that thereby God's Iustice may be
satisfied, for the whole punishment, which otherwise they
should haue endured. Yea such is the power of his <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
to infuse a vertue into such and such Alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

&amp;c. that whosoeuer shall frequent such places, or vse such
prayers, all Complements duely obserued: he may at his
pleasure free one, two, three, or more soules our of <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
Nay did not Couetousnes coole the heare of his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Charity,</hi> he might so bountifully powre out the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church vpon these prisoners in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that
they should all haue enough to weigh down the feales, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
a <hi>passe-port</hi> for <hi>Heauen.</hi> Such efficacie there is in that
<hi>spirituall Picke locke</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> hath in keeping. All
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14751:110"/>
which is very properly proued by the former places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and others also, were it needfull now to alleage them.
But thus we see the <hi>Catholiques</hi> are euery way furnished for
<hi>satisfactions,</hi> that what <hi>Christ</hi> hath not done for them, they
can doe for themselues, either to suffer and ouercome the
<hi>Temporall punishments</hi> of their Sinnes, or else, which is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
course, to buy out that <hi>punishment</hi> at a valuable price of
other <hi>satisfactionary</hi> workes, wherewith Gods Iustice shalbe
abundantly contented. Now whereas those whom they
terme <hi>Heretiques,</hi> cry out aloud that such <hi>satisfactions</hi> to
God's Iustice be indeed no <hi>Satisfactions</hi> at all, because they
are no wayes equall vnto the <hi>offence committed:</hi> and so no full
recompence of wrong offered vnto God: for the assoiling of
this doubt, they giue vs this distinction very necessary to be
obserued. Satisfaction is double.</p>
                  <p>1. Iustitiae: ex rigore Iustitiae, ad absolutam &amp; perfectam
Aequalitatem Quantitatis. <hi>That is.</hi> There is a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Iustice consisting in a perfect aequality between
the offence and wrong, and the recompence made, when so
much is done, or suffered, as the offended party can in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
exact. <hi>Now they grant that Man cannot satisfie
God in this sort in rigour of Iustice. Only Christ hath satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so; for vnto such a satisfaction it is required that it be
done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Ex proprijs. By that which is our owne.</p>
                  <p>2. Ex indebitis. By that which is not debt of it selfe.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Ad aequalitatem. By that which is of aequall worth and
value.</hi> Now none of these wayes can our satisfaction passe
in strict Iustice Because whatsoeuer we haue, 'tis God's free
gift: whatsoeuer we can doe, 'tis our due Obedience, &amp; when
we haue done all, yet we cannot by any finite act doe such
honour to God, as shalbe equall to that iniury we haue offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his infinite <hi>Maiestie.</hi> Euen the right of Nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants, That Man cannot <hi>parca reddere Deo,</hi>
giue him <hi>quid pro'quo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Acceptationis facti ex Gratiâ donante ad imperfectam
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14751:111"/>
Aequalitatem Proportionis &amp; ex Condigno. <hi>i, e.</hi> There is
a satisfaction of fauourable acceptance, wherein there is a
kinde of imperfect Proportion betweene the offence and the
recompence, when so much is done or suffered, as God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in gentlenes to take for good satisfaction. <hi>Thus then
a man may satisfie God's Iustice, because God giues him
grace to doe so much as he will accept for satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which
Grace is threefold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Grace of Iustification, whereby the Holy Ghost dwels
in vs and we are made Members of Christ, and Christ is
become our Head. By meanes of which vnion with
Christ, and inhabitation of the Spirit, it comes to passe
that our workes haue a singular vertue. For Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
vnto vs his satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by merits of them,
makes our Workes meritorious and satisfactorie vnto
God.</p>
                  <p>So that whereas all things whatsoeuer we could haue
done, where of no worth at all in the sight of God: now
Christ hath deserued such a Grace for vs that the <hi>spotted
ragges</hi> of our righteousnes and good workes being <hi>tincta
Christi sanguine</hi> (i. e.) died in the bloud of Christ receaue
such a colour, that they will passe for reasonable good
cloth. In a word, our <hi>money is</hi> now good siluer which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was but brasse. Againe, because the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> dwels
in the just, <hi>Ergo</hi> (as <hi>Bellar:</hi> profoundly argues) <hi>their Workes
proceeding from the Holy Ghost haue [quandam infinitatem] a
kind of infinitenes in them, and thereby, quandam aequalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
a kind of aequality with the injury which by sinning we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
vnto God.</hi> Euen as a man may say, that <hi>a fly</hi> or a <hi>spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
is a kind of infinite <hi>Creature</hi> because 'tis of <hi>Gods</hi> making:
and <hi>God</hi> you know is infinite. This is the first Grace of
<hi>Iustification.</hi> The 2 ye may call.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>The Grace of Euangelicall Counsailes.</hi> For although
God might of right challenge all our workes as due vnto
him: yet so it is that he commands not all, but onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades
and exhortes vnto some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By which bounty of God,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:14751:111"/>
it comes to passe that we haue certaine workes <hi>Propria &amp;
indebita, of our owne which we owe him not; and by these we
onely make satisfaction.</hi> Yea such is the bounty of God
that <hi>he suffers vs to merit by those things which be of his free
gift, and is willingly content that what we receaue at his hand,
we giue it him backe againe for a satisfactorie payment to his
Iustice.</hi> Which is very strange I tell you.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Lastly one Grace more God giues vs. Namely. When
hee pardons the fault he remoues the aeternity of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and makes it Temporall that so it may be more
easily satisfied for.</hi> All which particulars and <hi>Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
are sure and certaine, because the <hi>Catholique</hi> Doctors
haue firmely proued them out of their owne heads with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the helpe of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> So then they are agreed. That
our workes are not <hi>satisfactorie in Rigour of Iustice:</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>favourable</hi> acceptance, by grace giuen to doe them,
and Gods clemency in accepting them being done.</p>

their Arguments, whereby they seeke to couer their Fraud.
But they are not of that <hi>Moment</hi> as to spend time about
them, being too hasten to other matters. The summe of
them all comes vnto this. 1. That those afflictions and
Temporall chastisements which God hath laied vpon his
Children (for the Triall of their Faith and patience, for
their humiliation for sinnes past by hearty Repentance, for
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14751:112"/>
their admonition for the time to come, for the example of
others. &amp;c.) they must needs be, in these Mens Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
true <hi>satisfactions</hi> to Gods Iustice to expiate their sinnes
past. 2. That such good workes as the godly haue
performed for declaration of their <hi>piety;</hi> testification of their
thankfulnes vnto <hi>God;</hi> for to expresse the sorrow of <hi>Heart;</hi>
for to bring themselues to a greater <hi>measure</hi> of true <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
by much <hi>Praier, fasting,</hi> &amp;c. for to <hi>obtaine victorie</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

which they wanted; for to <hi>preuent</hi> or <hi>fit</hi> themselnes for

presently to be <hi>meritorious</hi> and <hi>satisfactorie</hi> to Gods
Iustice for <hi>Sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That such <hi>Pennance,</hi> as in the <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> was

must now be turned into a direct and proper <hi>satisfaction</hi> for
the sinne it selfe.</p>

<hi>Christ hath satisfied for the fault of our Sinnes; and so recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
vs vnto God, and for the aeternity of the Punishment: but

                     <hi>reconciled vs to God his Father.</hi> This is easily
put off. <hi>Christ hath reconciled vs.</hi> that is, <hi>Christ deserued
such Grace for vs: that we by our workes may reconcile our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</hi>
Iust as they say. <hi>Christ hath satisfied.</hi> that is. <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
Grace for vs: that we by our workes might satisfie.</hi> Let
them object, <hi>Our workes can be of no worth to appease Gods
anger.</hi> We will say. True. Of themselues they are not:
but <hi>Christ</hi> hath merited that they should be of sufficient
worth. Iust as themselues say vnto vs objecting, that
our workes be not of <hi>value</hi> to satisfie Gods Iustice. True,
say they. Of themselues they be not: but <hi>Christ</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
for them to make them <hi>satisfactorious.</hi> Thus if euery
idle distinction not fortified by necessary deduction from
Scripture might passe for a good answere, the certainty of
diuine Doctrine were soone shaken to pieces: and no <hi>Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
so absurd, but would be defended with much facility.</p>
                  <p>2. That Assertion of theirs. Namely. <hi>That the fault is
forgiuen and the punishment required,</hi> is most false and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd;
euen in common sense. To pardon a fault and be
friends and yet require full satisfaction; to forgiue the debt,
yet to exact the payment, be not these trimme kindnesses?
<note n="a" place="margin">Bell. de poen. lib. 4. cap. 1.</note>Bellarmine tels vs, there be some offences of so grieuous
Nature: that satisfaction cannot be made, but in a long time.
Now in this case the partie wronged may pardon the other,
and be reconciled to him: yet the offender remaine still bound
to make entire satisfaction for the wrong. But now the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi>
doth not name any such case: neither indeed can doe.
For suppose a subject hath offended his <hi>Prince</hi> and the fault
deserued 7. yeares close imprisonment for satisfaction. If the
<hi>Prince</hi> should say vnto him I pardon your offence, you haue
my loue; but yet you shall lie by it to the last daie: were it
not a mockerie, would any man thank him for such a kindnes?
It is to be thought the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> the incendiaries of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
would not thanke Christian Princes for such a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14751:113"/>
if they should pardon them their fault, and hang them vp.
The like absurditie there is in this, when they say; That after
the fault pardoned; yet in this Life and in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> the
temporall punishment must be suffered. For wherefore must
it be suffered? <hi>For satisfaction</hi> say they, To what? To God's
Iustice. For what now? Is it for the fault and offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?
No, That's pardoned. For what then? For just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this Assertion is contrary to good reason. For
God's <hi>Friendship,</hi> and his <hi>Iustice</hi> may not be diuided in this
sort, as if he were reconciled and well pleased with that Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
which hath violated his <hi>Iustice,</hi> and not made satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for it. God's friendship with Man followes <hi>satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to his <hi>Iustice:</hi> euen as his Enmity with Man is a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of the breach of his Iustice. His righteous will is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed,
therefore he is offended. His righteous will must be
satisfied before he be pleased. So that it is a vaine <hi>speculation</hi>
to thinke. <hi>Christ hath appeased God's anger, but not satisfied
his Iustice, for as much as his fauour is purchased onely by satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to his Iustice offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. This doctrine of <hi>humane satisfactions,</hi> obscures the
dignity, and ouerthrowes the Force of Christ's <hi>satisfactions.</hi>
If we haue a share, he hath not all the glory. Nay, he hath
scarse any at all. For aske wee. For what hath <hi>Christ</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
They say, to procure God's Loue to vs. But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, vnlesse he hath satisfied his Iustice. Hath he done this,
or no? Yes, he hath satisfied for the Aeternity of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Yea. But how know they that? What if we vpon
their grounds say, That he hath not satisfied for the Aeternity
of it: but only merited, that our sufferings and satisfactions
should be aequivalent to the aeternity of the <hi>Punishment?</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
considering that our Workes according to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
haue a certaine kinde of infinite value</hi> in them. Againe,
Aeternity is but an Accident of punishment of Sinne: the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials</hi>
of it are the Losse of Ioy, and the sense of Paine: if
therefore <hi>Christ</hi> haue satisfied only for that, he hath done but
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14751:114"/>
the least part. Neuerthelesse our Adversaries will needes
perswade vs, that <hi>humane satisfactions</hi> doe not so much
<hi>eclipse as illustrate</hi> the glory of <hi>Christ's satisfactions:</hi> in as
much as thereby he hath not only satisfied himself: but made
vs able also to satisfie. A great matter doubtlesse. But where
saith the Scripture any such matter, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath merited
that we might merit and satisfie. And moreouer by this
Tricke, whilest <hi>Christ</hi> makes vs able to merit and satisfie: his
owne satisfaction is plainly excluded. For come to the point,
and aske. Who is it satisfies God's Iustice for Sin? Christ,
or wee? Heere<note n="b" place="margin">Bel. Lib 1. de Purga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> stumbles like a blind horse, and

and he only <hi>satisfies Properly:</hi> but we <hi>Improperly.</hi> Our works
being only a Condition without which <hi>Christ's satisfaction</hi>
is not applied vnto vs. But such smell of the <hi>fagot.</hi> For 'tis
a perilous <hi>Haeresie</hi> to say, <hi>Christ onely satisfies for Sinnes.</hi> Well
others say, That both <hi>Christ and we our selues</hi> doe satisfie, &amp;
also there's two satisfactions for the same offence. But this
mettall clinketh not well neither. Wherefore others are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> likes it. That <hi>Wee only satisfie, not
Christ. Tertius tamen modus probabilior videtur [Quòd una

should be, thrust out <hi>Christ,</hi> and let vs only satisfie while he

                     <hi>Marnix</hi> merily.</p>
                  <p>4. That distinction of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in <hi>Strict Iustice,</hi> and
<hi>satisfaction</hi> in fauourable <hi>acceptance</hi> is vaine in this businesse.
We grant indeed that our good workes done out of <hi>Faith,</hi>
are pleasing to God, and graciously accepted of him: but can
it appeare, that God accepts them as <hi>satisfactions</hi> to his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice?</hi>
No Scripture intimates any such thing, That God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
doth thus dispense with his Iustice, and make that <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
acceptable, which is in it selfe no full satisfaction of
his <hi>Iustice.</hi> Shall we thinke that God in this case is put v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
those termes of <hi>Necessity,</hi> and <hi>complement</hi> which fall out
in <hi>humane satisfactions,</hi> betweene Man and Man? It may so
fall out that a Creditor (to whom 1000 Crowns are owing)
may be content if the debtor will yeeld vp his whole Estate,
though not worth 50. Because no more can be had. So in
case of offence,<note place="margin">Bell. lib. 4. de Paenit. cap. 1.</note> sometime, a litle formality, or a word or two
of confession of the wrong may be accepted for satisfaction.
But God wants no meanes to receiue full satisfaction of vs,
either vpon our owne persons, or vpon <hi>Christ for vs.</hi> And
therefore 'tis without ground to imagine such a facility and
partiality of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> as to be satisfied with a few poore
<hi>complementall Formalities.</hi> Satisfactions to God's <hi>Iustice</hi> wee
acknowledge none; but such as are in <hi>Iustice</hi> sufficient. Such
are <hi>Christ's satisfactions.</hi> But as for vs, we haue nothing
to doe with <hi>satisfactions,</hi> but with free <hi>Pardons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. This Doctrine of <hi>humane satisfactions</hi> taught in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is altogether full of <hi>vncertainty,</hi> and <hi>ergo,</hi>
brings no rest and <hi>peace</hi> vnto <hi>mens Consciences,</hi> at all. God
pardons the fault: but requires the <hi>punishment</hi> say they. But
when is this? Is it alwaies? No, sometimes he pardons
both. But can they tell certainly when he doth? when not?
At <hi>Martyrdome</hi> he pardons all. How know they that? or
how know they he doth it not at other times too? <hi>Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
