            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I Beg leave, Gentlemen, to prefix your Names to this little Treatise about Moral Duties, which the wise Author of it thought fit to recommend to his own Son, and which has usually been look'd upon as one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest and compleatest in its kind. It has alter'd its Dress indeed since it came under my Hands, and I am afraid, may-have suffer'd very much by the Alteration: however, as to the Body and more substantial Parts of it, I hope 'tis still the same, and worthy of that Opinion, which the Author himself had of it, <hi>That 'twas a very good Present, if made such Use of, as the Nature and Importance of its Argument requir'd.</hi> 'Twas at first design'd for a Person in your Circumstances, a Student in an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity, a young Gentleman of great Hopes, one from whom his Country did expect to receive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and his Friends no small Comfort and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: I thought I could not do better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after once I had resolv'd to Translate it into English, than Dedicate it to You, who have so good
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:64327:4"/>
a Title to it, as well upon this as upon some other Accounts. The Honour and Happiness I have in being appointed the Director of your Studies, the many Favours and Obligations I have receiv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, together with a great many other Inducements arising from so close and endearing a Relation, almost forc'd me to make this publick Acknowledgment. And I confess I was desirous my self of doing it, both that it might serve for a Testimony of that Value and Esteem which I have for you; and that I might oblige you by it, in some measure, to read these Precepts, when you are gone from under my Care, which most People in those Circumstances are but too ready to forget. You will find here all the more useful Parts of Virtue so clearly set before you; the Excellence and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it so judiciously enlarg'd upon; the Necessity of it toward the procuring a Reputation, toward the meeting with Encouragement and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in our Undertakings: and, in a word, toward the obtaining any tolerable degree of Happiness, in whatever State of Life, so abundantly made out; that I hardly know of any thing (relating to meer Morality) that could more fitly be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Persons in <hi>Your</hi> Circumstances, by one in <hi>Mine,</hi> than this excellent Treatise. 'Tis true you have read it in its Original Language, and my Request to you is, that you would continue to do so; the Design of this Translation being not to exclude, but to assist the Latin: which if it may but do in any tolerable manner, so as to help toward the Understanding of such excellent Rules of Living, I have obtain'd my End.</p>
            <p>Such as it is, Gentlemen, I heartily present it to you; wishing that it may be in some measure ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:64327:4"/>
to those Ends, for which it was at first design'd; and that all, but especially Men of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and Fortune, and such as are likely to make some Figure in the World, would be persuaded to learn ev'n from an Heathen Writer, That there is no true Profit or Advantage, no solid Reputation or Honour, and, in short, no real Happiness any where to be found, except in the Practice of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Honesty.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE turning into <hi>English</hi> so excellent a Discourse as this is, I suppose, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stand in need of an Apology: But the attempting it after so eminent a Person as Sir <hi>R. L' Estrange,</hi> perhaps will hardly admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I do not design to spin out a long Preface, in making Excuses for so bold an Undertaking; much less in finding fault with the Performance of that <hi>Gentleman:</hi> I have more regard to the Reader's Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than to do the former; and am too sensible of <hi>His</hi> great Worth and my own Miscarriages, to be guilty of the latter. I shall only beg leave to assure the Reader, That this Translation was well-nigh finish'd, before I saw the <hi>last</hi> Edition of Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s, in which he hath corrected some very notorious and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Faults, that were in all the <hi>former.</hi> I hope therefore it could be no Presumption in me to think his Translation faulty, since he himself by this late Alteration, has in effect acknowleg'd it. I might, 'tis true, have suppress'd my own Work, when I saw he had corrected those Mistakes and Oversights I had formerly found in his, and which first put me upon making this new Attempt: But beside that all Men, when once they are pretty far advanc'd in any Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, (as I then was) are naturally unwilling to have it taken out of their Hands, and desirous of going
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:64327:5"/>
on to see an end of it; and beside that, I think there are still some places, in which he hath mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or not clearly enough explain'd, the Meaning of the Author: I was always of Opinion, That there would be something further necessary, before <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi> could be throughly understood; and that a bare Translation, and especially so close an one as Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s is, could never give the Reader a View of the deep Sence, and sometimes intricate Method of that Book. I resolv'd therefore to go on with my design'd Translation of it, and to add such things to it by way of Explication, as seem'd necessary or convenient for the better understanding the Design, Meaning and Method of the Author. Those People therefore, that can understand <hi>Cicero</hi> by Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s Translation, may still make use of it if they please, notwithstanding any thing I have said to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and I hope there's no harm done: and for those that cannot, I have attempted this new one, which I hope may be in some measure serviceable to that End.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Book is so well known, that 'twould be altogether needless to give any Account of him in this place: As for the Book it self, it has always been look'd upon as one of the perfectest Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Writings, and one of the noblest Systems of Moral Precepts, that have ever been left us by the ancient Heathens; and not without reason: There appears all along in it so great a Love and Concern for Virtue, which he recommends to his Son with all imaginable Earnestness; so deep a Sence of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to Honesty, and Aversion for every thing that's contrary to it; such an admirable Inclination for the Virtues of Plainness, Truth and Sincerity, and such a generous Contempt of all shuffling, mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand Dealings; such Piety toward his Native Country, and hearty Concern for the Calamities it
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:64327:6"/>
groan'd under, and withal so much Hatred and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation for those Men, who had been the Causes of its Misfortunes; and, in a word, so many excellent Rules of Life, with reference to our Duty either to God or Men, and to those in their several Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Relations, whether of Kindred, Friends or Benefactors, as have justly recommended it to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of all the World, and given it the first place among the eminent and most celebrated Writings of this kind. The Scope and Design of it in his own words is, To lay down some Directions and Precepts of good Living, according to which upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Men ought to govern their Lives and Actions; so that whatever State of Life a Man is in, whether Publick or Private, of Governour or Governed, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity or Adversity, old Age or Youth, he will here find Rules how he ought to demean himself in any of those Capacities; and will be told what that is, which the Dignity and Excellence of his own Nature requires in regard to himself; and what the several sorts of Alliance or Society among Men demand, in relation to other People: So that while other parts of Learning and Knowledge are most times confin'd either to certain Ages, certain Times, or certain Places, this is of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and universal Use; 'tis (as our Author says up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Subject) necessary for Youth as well as old Age; it directs in Prosperity as well as in Adversity; 'tis a Delight to us at home, and a Companion for us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; <hi>Pernoctat nobiscum, peregrinatur, rustica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas principally design'd for the Use of his own Son, whom he had sent to <hi>Athens</hi> for the benefit of Study, while all things were in Disorder and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Defeat in the <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian</hi> Field: But he tells us he has purposely fram'd it in such a manner, as that it might be equally ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to all other People. The time of its writing
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:64327:6"/>
was after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Murther, when <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> and his Adherents had got the Power into their Hands, and <hi>Cicero</hi> (as he complains at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third Book) was by wicked Arms driven away from the City, and forc'd to betake himself to his private Retirements. At this time he thought to have gone to <hi>Athens</hi> to his Son, and was accordingly on his Journey, when he was call'd back again by the loud Cries of his Country, as he intimates in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this Discourse, and explains more at large in the beginning of his first <hi>Philippick.</hi> He return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> upon this Recal, but found things very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what he expected, when he came thither: Hereupon he withdrew himself to his Houses in the Country, resolving to wait for some fitter Opportunity of being serviceable to the Republick. From this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement he sent these Precepts in writing to his Son, which he design'd to have given him by word of Mouth, had he arriv'd at <hi>Athens.</hi> The Method he proceeds in is this which follows: After a short Discourse by way of Preface to his Son, and fixing the right Notion of the Subject he is to treat about, he endeavours to beget in him a Love of <hi>Honesty,</hi> by representing it as amiable and commendable in it self, and agreeable to the Nature and Reason of Mankind. He divides it into four Parts or general Heads, <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Justice, Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> which are usûally call'd the four <hi>Cardinal Virtues,</hi> and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in order upon every one of 'em, with all their several Species or Branches, and the Vices that stand in opposition to 'em. And this he does, not in a dry and scholastical Manner, by enquiring nicely wherein the strict Nature of the several Virtues consists, and which of their opposite Vices they are nearest to, (which my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> somewhere very ingeniously observes, is like a Master's setting a Boy a Copy to write after, without ever shewing him how he should make his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:64327:7"/>
but by laying down such Rules under each of these Heads, as may direct Men in the Practice of the Duties requir'd of 'em. Afterwards he compares <hi>them</hi> with one another, and shews in what Order they are to be perform'd by us: As, <hi>Justice,</hi> for Example, before <hi>Knowledge, Fortitude,</hi> &amp;c. All these Virtues, when taken together, make up the general Notion of <hi>Honestum;</hi> and when taken separately, are so many Branches or distinct Members of it.</p>
            <p>But seeing something else beside <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Honesty</hi> is necessarily requisite, or at least useful and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for our well-being here; such as are the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> and <hi>Conveniences</hi> of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> Riches, Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Success in Business, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Notion of the word <hi>Profit:</hi> therefore in the second Book he endeavours to shew how these are to be obtain'd: And having made it appear, That all the <hi>Advantages</hi> Men enjoy, and the <hi>Evils</hi> they endure, are principally owing to Men themselves: From thence he infers, That the Way whereby we may obtain the <hi>former,</hi> and avoid the <hi>latter,</hi> is to procure the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of <hi>Men</hi> on our side, so as to have <hi>them</hi> ready to assist us upon occasion. This he shews can be done no other way, than by performing those Duties which <hi>Honesty</hi> requires of us: <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> by <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> in our Words and Actions, whereby Men are drawn to place their Trust and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in us; (where also he particularly shews, that Pretending and Hypocrisie can never get a Man any lasting Honour) by <hi>Kindness</hi> and <hi>Beneficence, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie</hi> and <hi>Affability,</hi> which beget in Men a Love and Affection toward us: and lastly, by <hi>Fortitude, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Money,</hi> &amp;c. which are Virtues that draw Men to Wonder and Admiration, and make 'em think us Persons that really deserve to be promoted.</p>
            <p>But because Riches, Honours, Power and the like, which <hi>seem</hi> to be a Profit and Advantage to us, may often
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:64327:7"/>
interfere with Virtue and Duty, which <hi>really</hi> are such; therefore in the third Book he endeavours to shew, How a good Man ought to carry himself in such a Case; and makes it appear, That Riches, Honours, Kingdoms and Empires are far from being truly an Advantage to any Man, whenever they are gotten by unlawful means; and that no Honest Man would do any thing that's contrary to Conscience or Honesty, tho' sure to obtain even the whole World by it. All which he builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Foundation, <hi>That the Goods of the Soul,</hi> viz. <hi>Virtue and Honesty, are, if not the</hi> only, <hi>yet infinitely the</hi> greatest <hi>Goods;</hi> (which is a Principle allow'd of by all the wiser Philosophers) from whence it must follow, That whoever parts with <hi>these</hi> upon the account of any Riches, or other seeming Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, be it never so great, must needs be a Looser; for he forfeits a <hi>greater</hi> for the sake of a <hi>less</hi> Good, and in hopes of getting a <hi>seeming,</hi> deprives himself of a <hi>real Interest.</hi> Here he goes over each of the Virtues mention'd in the first Book, and proves that nothing can be a Man's true Profit, tho' it should bring him all the appearing Advantages in the World, and tho' he were sure to keep it secret from the Eyes of all Men, and even the Gods themselves, that is contrary to the Duties of Prudence and Justice, of Fortitude and Moderation. In a word, Here are Rules for the Government of our Lives in relation to <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Ourselves,</hi> such as are deservedly admired in a Heathen, and might have well become even a Christian Writer: He tells us, That to procure the Favour of the <hi>Former,</hi> we must live a religious and holy Life: That, as to the <hi>Second,</hi> there's an Alliance or Society between all Mankind, whereby each Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is oblig'd to do his best, toward promoting the Happiness and Welfare of the whole Body, and rather to die than do another any Injury: That, as to <hi>Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> we should always consider the Dignity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:64327:8"/>
of our Reasonable Nature, and take care that we never be guilty of any Action, that may any wise stain or unbecome its Honour: This, as he goes on, will quickly teach us, how base a thing it is to dissolve in Luxury, Softness, <hi>&amp;c.—</hi>Thus have I endeavour'd to present the Reader with a general View of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Treatise: should I proceed to tell him, That some of the most eminent Writers in the World have ow'd great part of their Credit to it: That the <hi>Sandersons, Grotiuses, Pufendorfs,</hi> &amp;c. are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly oblig'd to it for their Skill in determining Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cases, perhaps he might think me rather zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than impartial, in my Account of it: Tho' I can assure him 'tis no more than what is strictly true. The first of those great Persons (as the Writer of his Life tells us) had it all by heart; and how much Use the two latter have made of it, I leave those to judge who have been conversant with their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings—. But the Book can much better recommend it self by its own true Value, than I can do by any thing I am able to say of it: thither therefore I shall refer the Reader for his further Satisfaction, after I have told him, in a few words; what has been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this new Translation.</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd to express what I conceiv'd to be the Sence and Meaning of the Author, in as full and comprehensive words as I was able, attending all along to the principal Scope and Design of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, rather than to the particular Words and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. I have taken care however to let none of his Words escape, without giving the Sence of 'em in our own Language: So far from that, that I rather expect to be condemn'd, on the other hand, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining some of 'em a great deal too much, and spending a Line perhaps, or more, in that, which the Author express'd in but one single Word: But whoever considers the Nature of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and our
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:64327:8"/>
Author's Way of Writing, especially in this Book, will easily perceive that 'twas necessary for me to do so, otherwise the <hi>English</hi> would have been almost as hard to be understood, as the <hi>Latin:</hi> For the Truth of which I refer the Reader to Chap. <hi>35, 36, 37.</hi> Book <hi>1.</hi> not to name innumerable other places. I have had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Eye all along to the Method of the Discourse, and the Connexion or Dependance of one part of it upon another; which because it is oftentimes very obscure, I have generally added the distinguishing Terms of <hi>first, second,</hi> &amp;c. and where that could not be done, have sometimes added a Line perhaps, to shew how he passes from one thing to another: But this I have generally told the Reader of, or else have printed what is so added in a different Letter; as may be seen at the beginning of Chap. <hi>6,</hi> and the end of Chap. <hi>7.</hi> Book <hi>1.</hi> As to some things, that are of little or no consequence toward understanding the Author, as if I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated <hi>Caena</hi> Dinner; <hi>Hominis honorati &amp; principis,</hi> a Gentleman, or a Person of Honour; <hi>Convivium,</hi> sitting at a Table, and over a Glass of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if in a philosophical Discourse as this is, I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made use of an unusual Word; I suppose they'll be counted not unwarrantable Liberties, but such as are commonly taken by Translators. If in the main I have hit upon the true Sence and Meaning of my Author, and express'd it in such clear and intelligible Terms, as may make the Reader see what is the Force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Reasonableness of his Precepts, the Fitness of his several Illustrations and Examples, with those other Virtues which have rendred this Book so deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly Famous; I have obtain'd what I principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by this Attempt.</p>
            <p>The Design of the Notes is chiefly to point out the Author's Method, and explain some Passages in him that seem'd more obscure than the rest: If the Reader find fault, that some of 'em regard rather the <hi>Latin</hi>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:64327:9"/>
than the <hi>English;</hi> and others seem trivial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable: I desire he would take notice, that I would not have the <hi>English</hi> thrust out the <hi>Latin,</hi> but rather promote and facilitate the Reading of it; and that I did not design to make Notes for Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (by whom I am fitter to be taught my self) but rather for the Young and Less-knowing sort of People.</p>
            <p>I have gone according to that Division of Chapters, which is usually receiv'd, because the Book has been quoted according to it, and to have made any Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would but have bred Confusion; tho' otherwise I think 'tis the most ignorant and ridiculous one that was ever made, except in some other of our Author's Writings. I have put before each Chapter a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of what is contain'd in it: and to the whole have subjoyn'd an Index, referring to all the principal Matters that are mention'd in the Book. In a word, I have not wilfully omitted any thing, as far as was possible in so small a Volume, (for I did not design to write a large Commentary, or play the Critick upon my Author) that seem'd necessary or useful toward a full Explication of this excellent Discourse. I have made some use of Sir <hi>R. L'Estrange</hi>'s <hi>English,</hi> and especially Mr. <hi>Du B.</hi>'s <hi>French</hi> Translation; which I gratefully acknowledge. I have follow'd that Sence which to me seem'd most agreeable to the Author's Design, without finding fault with the Interpretations of other People, or speaking Ill of those who have not been of my Mind; and if I have been mistaken my self in any thing (as I don't question but I many times have) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Reader to use the same Candor and Forgiveness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me: that as, I think, I have giv'n no body any just Cause of Complaint, so I may not have any my self from other People. In fine, I am sure my Design was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; the Success of it I must leave to the Reader's Judgment: I shall only say, That as I look for no Honour from any thing I can do, more especially of this nature; so I hope that however I may expect a Pardon.</p>

there is more of the force and power of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, yet is the smooth and even Stile of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by no means to be neglected. And of all the <hi>Grecians</hi> I find not one, that has employ'd his Pen in both these kinds; and been at once successful in the Language of the Bar, and this other more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and easie Stile of Philosophical Discourses: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <note n="g" place="bottom">A Peripatetick born at <hi>Phalerum,</hi> a small Town on the Sea-coast of <hi>Attica,</hi> from whence he had his Name.

Being afterwards driven our by <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes,</hi> Son of <hi>Antigonus, Alexander</hi> the Great's Captain, he fled to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by whom he was set over the famous <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Library, which contain'd in it (as some write) 700000 Volumes.

                  <hi>Offices</hi> or <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> seem of the largest extent and comprehension: For they take in every part of our Lives, so that whatever we go about, whether of publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affairs, whether at home or abroad, whether consider'd barely by our selves, or as we stand in relation to other People, we lye constantly under an <hi>Obligation</hi> to some Duties; and, as all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64327:12"/>
and Credit of our Lives proceeds from the due Discharge of <hi>This,</hi> so all the Baseness and Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 'em results from the Non-observance of <hi>It.</hi> Now, tho' this be a Subject which all Philosophers have busied themselves about, (for, who ever dar'd to assume that Name without laying down some Instructions about Duty?) yet have some <note n="b" place="bottom">He means chiefly the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who made Man's Happiness to consist in Pleasure, and his Misery in Pain, which is indeed to subvert the very Foundations of Honesty. For seeing there is nothing that Men will not do, for the obtaining their chief Good, and avoiding the greatest Evil; it necessarily follows, that (as long as they act consistently with their Principles) these Men will betray their Friends, break their Oaths, or do any thing in the World, rather than forego any Pleasure, or endure any Pain. Therefore he has reason to say, <hi>They can never do the Duties of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> &amp;c. For certainly, if I count Pleasure my greatest Good, I shall rather part with my Honesty than that; and if I reckon Pain the greatest of Evils, I'll rather lose a Friend, be Unmerciful, or Unjust, than ever undergo it. The same may be said of those that place their Happiness in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Misery in the contrary. <hi>See</hi> Tusc. Quest. 2. 6.</note> Sects of 'em given such accounts of Man's Happiness and Misery, as destroy the very Being of Virtue and Honesty. For he that makes any thing his chiefest Good, wherein Justice or Virtue does not bear a part, and sets up Profit, not Honesty for the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Happiness; as long as he acts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with his own Principles, and is not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd by meer Dictates of Reason and Humanity, can never do the Offices of Friendship, Justice or Liberality. Nor can he be ever a Man of Courage, who thinks that Pain is the greatest Evil; or he of Temperance, who imagins Pleasure to be the Sovereign Good. Which things are all so obvious and plain, that one would think they could never stand in need of a Dispute: however, I have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Of the former he has discours'd in his Books <hi>de Finibus:</hi> the latter makes the Subject of his present Enquiry.</note> THe whole subject of Duties then, in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Latitude, comprehends under it these two Parts: The first is taken up in explaining what is <hi>Good,</hi> and what our <hi>greatest Good.</hi> The second in certain Directions and Precepts, according to which, upon all occasions, 'tis our Duty to govern our Lives and Actions. To the first Part belong such Questions as these, <hi>Wnether all Duties are perfect, or</hi>

There is also another <note n="c" place="bottom">Philosophers usually reckon three Degrees or States of Virtue; The <hi>first</hi> utterly imperfect, before a Man has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an Habit of it; which is rather an Entrance into, than a State of, Virtue, therefore not mentioned here by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.

                  <hi>Imperfection;</hi> and by that, which we have call'd <hi>Ordinary,</hi> such a one, as, <hi>A fair and reasonable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count may be given for the doing of it.</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">I have enlarg'd a little upon our Author here, to make his Sence more plain.</note> Now these <hi>fair and reasonable Accounts</hi> are all to be drawn from several Heads, which are by <hi>Panaetius</hi> reduc'd to three, and may be call'd general Heads of Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Doubting concerning any Action, whether it should, or should not be done. The first is when 'tis consulted or doubted, Whether the Action, that's under Consideration, be Honest or Dishonest; in which Enquiry Men are often divided between se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Opinions. The second is, when 'tis enquired and consulted, Whether the Action, that's under Deliberation, will supply us with the Pleasures and Conveniencies of Life, furnish us with Plenty of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, such as Riches, Honors, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may put us into a capacity of doing good to our selves, and to all those for whom we are more nearly concern'd; all which Enquiry comes under the general Head of <note n="e" place="bottom">He comprehends then under the Notion of Profit, not only Riches and Honors, but all the other Conveniencies and Pleasures of Life; such as Health, Strength, bodily Pleasures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And an Action that will supply us with any of these, is what he calls by the name of a <hi>profitable</hi> one.</note> 
                  <hi>Profit.</hi> The third Ground or Reason of Doubting is, When that thing, which <note n="f" place="bottom">He says <hi>seems to be,</hi> because however it may supply us with the Conveniencies of Life, yet 'tis not really, but only seems to be profitable, if it thwart Honesty. For Honesty being the <hi>greatest,</hi> if not <hi>only</hi> Good, as he before laid down, whatever takes away our Honesty, must needs be unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us, tho' it should supply us with all the Pleasures and Glories of the World, as he shews at large in the third Book.</note> seems to be profitable for us, comes into competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that which is Honest: For then our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest drawing us one way, and Honesty pulling us
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64327:15"/>
back another, the wavering Mind is, as 'twere, toru in sunder between the two, and is rack'd with doubting and anxious Thoughts. There's no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fault in any Division, than not to take in all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Matter to be divided; and yet two are omitted in the now mention'd one of <hi>Panaetius.</hi> For Men not only consult and deliberate, whether such an Action be Honest or Dishonest; but also, Of two Honests, that are both propos'd to 'em, which is the most so; and, in like manner, Of two Profitables, which is the most profitable. From whence it appears, That what he thought was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in three, ought rather to be divided into five Heads. <note n="g" place="bottom">Having thus laid down his five Heads of Deliberation, he tells you in what Method he designs to discourse of 'em. In the first Book he'll handle the two about Honesty: First, <hi>Whether an Action be Honest or Dishonest?</hi> to ch. 43. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Of two that are both Honest, which is the most so?</hi> to the end. In the second Book he treats of Profitable, enquiring, First, <hi>Whether an Action be Profitable, or not?</hi> to ch. 25. Secondly, <hi>Of two that are both Profitable, which is the most so?</hi> to the end. The whole Subject of the third Book is the fifth Head, <hi>When a seeming Profit interferes with Honesty, how a Man should do to know what is his Duty?</hi> I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded something to the Text here, to make the Method more plain.</note> We must then, in the first place, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about <hi>Honesty,</hi> and this we shall do under these two Enquiries; <hi>Whether the thing propos'd be Honest or Dishonest?</hi> And, <hi>Of two that are Honest, which is the most so?</hi> which will make up the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our First Book. We shall treat in our Second of <hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi> under the same Heads. And lastly, in our Third, we shall endeavour to shew, <hi>When a seeming Advantage and Honesty come into competition, how a good Man should determin his Judgment.</hi>

                  <note n="a" place="bottom">His Design he has told us is, to treat of the Means for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Man's Happiness. Now the Happiness of any thing is the highest Perfection of its Nature, which consists in acting most agreeably to its Dictates: as that's a perfect Horse or Dog, which does those things best, which are most according to the Natures of those Animals. The Duties therefore, of which he is to treat, since their Design is to bring Men to Happiness, must needs be such as are perfective of, and consequently such as are agreeable to, the Nature of Man. And to shew that they are so, and how they are deduc'd and deriv'd from it, 'twas necessary for him in the first place, to shew wherein the Nature of Man consists, and how it differs from that of other Creatures; which is therefore the Design of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>See his</hi> de Fin. <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. <hi>and Book</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> THe first thing then to be taken notice of is this, That every Creature doth by Nature endeavour to preserve its own self, its Life and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and to shun and avoid those things which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear prejudicial and hurtful to it; but to seek and procure whatever is necessary for the support of its Being, and advancement of its Happiness, such as Food, Shelter, and the like. There is likewise common to all sorts of Animals, a Desire of Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the continuance and propagation of their several Species; together with a Love and Concern for their young Ones. Now there's this special Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Men and Brutes; that the <hi>latter</hi> are govern'd by nothing but their Sences, never look any farther than just to what strikes and affects 'em at present, and have a very little, if any Concern for what is past or to come: But the <hi>former</hi> are Creatures endow'd with Reason, which gives 'em a power to carry their Thoughts to the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Things; to discover Causes before they have yet produc'd their Effects; to see the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64327:16"/>
and even the first Seeds, (as it were) and Appearances of 'em; to compare like Occurrences with like; and by joyning what is past, and what is to come together, to make a just Estimate of the one from the other; whereby they are able at once to take a View of their whole Lives, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly make provision for the Necessities of 'em. <note n="b" place="bottom">How <hi>Justice,</hi> or the Virtues relating to Human Society, such as Liberality, Good-nature, Gratitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Dictates and Principles of Human Nature.</note> And the same force of Reason makes all Men by nature to Love one another, and desire an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Words and Actions.

Hence 'tis our Minds are no sooner free, from the Thoughts and Engagements of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Business, but we presently long to be either seeing, or hearing, or learning of something; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem the Knowledge of things secret and wonderful, as a necessary Ingredient of a happy Life. From whence it appears, That nothing is more agreeable and suited to the Nature and Minds of Men, than undisguis'd Openness, Truth and Sincerity. Next to this Love and Affection for Truth <note n="e" place="bottom">How <hi>Fortitude,</hi> or <hi>Greatness of Soul,</hi> is agreeable to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature.</note>, there follows in the Soul an impatient Desire and Inclination to Rule; so that whoever has the genuin Nature of a Man in him, will never endure to be subject to another, unless he be one that instructs, or advises, or is invested with a just and lawful Authority, for the Benefit of the Publick. From whence there arises a Greatness of Soul, <note n="f" place="bottom">For this desire of Rule, and being subject to no body, makes a Man scorn to be a Slave either to his own Passions, or Inclinations; or part with his Liberty to any one else, for the sake of Honors, Preferments, <hi>&amp;c.

Parts in the <hi>Objects of Sense;</hi> which Nature and Reason observing in them, from thence take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to apply the same also to <hi>those of the Mind;</hi> and conclude that Beauty, Consistency, and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, should be much more kept up in our Words and Actions; and therefore command us, That nothing be done that is effeminate or unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, That so strict a Guard be kept over e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thought and Action, as that no Lust or Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness be either conceiv'd or practis'd by us.

               </argument>
               <p>THus, Son <hi>Marcus,</hi> have I giv'n you a rough Draught, and just the Outlines, as it were, of <hi>Honesty;</hi> which could she be seen in her full Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with mortal Eye, would make the whole World (as <hi>Plato</hi> has said) be in love with <note n="a" place="bottom">For what else is it but only Wisdom, that leads us to the attainment of Virtue and Honesty? Or rather indeed what else is Wisdom, but Virtue and Honesty it self? He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that can behold the glorious Beauties of Honesty, must needs fall in Love with Wisdom; which indeed is nothing but Honesty it self; it being impossible for any One to be Wise, that is not at the same time Virtuous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest; Knavishness and Roguery being always the greatest Folly.</note> Wisdom. Now whatever's contain'd under the Notion of Honesty, arises from one of these four Heads; <hi>First,</hi> A sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Enquiry and Observation for the finding out of Truth; <hi>which may be called by the general name of Prudence. Secondly,</hi> A Care to maintain that Society and mutual Entercourse, which is between Men; to render to every Man what is his due; and to stand to one's Words in all Promises and Bargains; <hi>which we call Justice. Thirdly,</hi> The Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unshaken Resolution of a truely brave and invincible Mind; <hi>which goes by the name of Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity or Fortitude.</hi> And, <hi>Lastly,</hi> A Keeping of our Words and Actions within the due Limits of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Decency; under which are comprehended <note n="b" place="bottom">He doth not therefore restrain Temperance, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> did, and we in our Language do, to observing a Mediocrity in Eating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but makes it belong to all the other Virtues, and set 'em their Bounds, which if they pass they degenerate into Vices.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64327:19"/>
Mind; which appears, as in getting things profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pleasant for our selves and Dependants; so more especially in despising and being above 'em.

               <argument>
                  <p>Prudence or Contemplation of Truth, the first of the general Virtues, is the nearest ally'd to the Nature of Man. Two Cautions concerning it. It ought to give place to the Duties of the Active Life. What it ought especially to be employ'd about.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">I have added something to the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to make the Connexion with the foregoing plainer.</note> HAving thus explain'd how the whole Nature, and Power of Honesty, is deduc'd from some one of these four Parts, we are now to discourse of 'em each in particular. And, first, Of <hi>Prudence,</hi> which is wholly taken up in the knowledge of Truth, and has the nearest Affinity of any with the reasonable Nature of Man. For how are we all of us drawn and entic'd with the Desire of Wisdom? How noble and glorious a thing do we imagin it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64327:19"/>
to excel in Knowledge? And how mean and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful do we count it on the other hand, to slip, to be in an Error, to be Ignorant, or to be impos'd upon? In gratifying this so natural and virtuous Inclination in the Mind of Man, there are two grand Faults to be carefully avoided: The <hi>first</hi> is an over-great Hastiness and Rashness in giving up our Assent, presuming that we know things before we really do so. Whoever desires (as I am sure all ought) to avoid this Error, must in all his Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries allow himself time, and diligently consider the Matter with himself, before he proceeds to pass his Judgment upon it. The <hi>second</hi> Fault is, That a great many Men bestow abundance of Study, and a world of Pains, upon very difficult and obscure Subjects; and such as perhaps, when they are found out, are of but very little, or no Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Would Men but be careful to shun these two Mistakes, whatsoever Study or Pains they might spend upon virtuous, worthy, or profitable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, 'twould not without Reason be highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Thus <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>C. Sulpicius Gallus,</hi> Praetor of <hi>Rome,</hi> an <hi>U. C.</hi> 581, and the Year after, Tribune of a Legion under <hi>P.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64327:20"/>
Business, of all which parts of Learning, is the finding out of Truth. No Man however should be so taken up in the Search of Truth, as thereby to neglect the more necessary Duties of the Active Life: For, after all is done, 'tis Action only that gives a true Value and Commendation to Virtue. Not that we are able to be always a doing without intermission, but often retire from Business to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; beside that the Mind, <note n="e" place="bottom">What great Use might be made of this continual Activity of the Soul, if instead of spending it (as too many do) upon frivolous, useless and wicked Subjects, 'twere constantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd upon some virtuous, useful or necessary Enquiries?</note> which is in perpetual motion and agitation, of it self will supply us with Study and Thinking, whether we set our selves to it, or not. In a word, The general aim and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of our Thought, and application of Mind, <note n="f" place="bottom">This is no more than the ordinary <hi>School-division</hi> of the Understanding into Practical and Speculative; The former considers things in order to Practice, as, whether Good or Bad, Honest or Dishonest, tending to a happy or miserable Life: The latter only in order to Knowledge, whether they are True, or not True, without any direct tendency to Practice at all. The former is only <hi>Prudence,</hi> and the latter <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> By which it appears in what Sence he takes the word <hi>Truth,</hi> when he says, 'Tis the Object of this Virtue, <hi>viz.</hi> not only for <hi>Truth,</hi> as opposite to <hi>Falshood</hi> in Speculation; but as comprehending under it that which is <hi>truly</hi> Good and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, as opposite to Vice and Dishonesty.</note> is either the attainment of such things as are Honest, and tend to a virtuous and happy way of Life; or else the improvement of our Reason and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in Wisdom and Knowledge.

                     <hi>The second general Virtue, which consists in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Human Society. Two Parts of it,</hi> Justice <hi>and</hi> Liberality. <hi>The first Duty of Justice. All things at first common. The Original of Property.

               </argument>
               <p>OF the other remaining three, <note n="a" place="bottom">Which may be call'd <hi>Justice</hi> in a larger signification of that Word, as it takes in all the Duties Men owe to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the second general Head he mention'd; and comprehends under it <hi>Justice</hi> strictly so call'd, and <hi>Liberality</hi> or Kindness one to another; of which he begins to treat, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.</note> that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in upholding Society, and keeping up mutual Love and good Nature amongst Mankind, seems of the largest and most diffusive Extent. It comprehends under it these two Parts: First, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> which is much the most glorious and splendid of all Virtues, and alone entitles us to the Name and Appellation of <hi>Good</hi> Men. And, Secondly, <hi>Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> which may also be call'd either Bounty or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.

                  <note n="b" place="bottom">The word <hi>deinde</hi> doth not denote a second Duty of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but only the second Part of the first Duty, of, <hi>Doing no Wrong.</hi> The meaning is, That of things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he should content himself with his reasonable Share: and those which are appropriate to particular Persons, he should suffer to remain in the State they are without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.

                  <hi>and whatever belongs either to all in common, or to particular Persons as their own Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, should not be alter'd, but made use of accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi> Now no Man can say that he has any thing

               <p>AS for the <note n="a" place="bottom">He comes now to the second sort of Injustice, that of Omission; the Causes of which are, first, Fear of giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, of Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> second, which only consists <hi>in seeing another Injur'd, and being wanting to our Duty, by not defending him;</hi> the Causes of <hi>that</hi> are wont to be several. For some are afraid of offending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or of bringing a trouble and charge upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Others are negligent, idle, or mean-spirited: And a third sort there is, who are so taken up with their own Concerns, that they have no time left to regard the Oppress'd, whom yet 'tis their Duty to save and protect. I am therefore of Opinion, that <hi>Plato</hi>'s Consequence will hardly hold good, where speaking about the Philosophers, he says, <q>They are wholly taken up in the seeking out of Truth, and perfectly neglect and make light of those things, which the rest of the World are so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after, and so contend about; and that <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> they are just.</q> 
                  <hi>This,</hi> I say, <hi>I am afraid is a bad Consequence;</hi> for tho', 'tis true, <note n="b" place="bottom">In Chap. 21. he puts two Cases, wherein he thinks these Men may be excusable: 1.

So that 'tis believ'd, they'd hardly ever trouble 'emselves so far, as at all to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-meddle with the Business of the Publick, if it was not altogether, as it were, forc'd upon them. But 'twere a great deal better would they do it vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily; for an <note n="c" place="bottom">The Moralists make a distinction between doing an <hi>honest</hi> Action, and doing it <hi>honestly, honestum</hi> and <hi>honeste agere.</hi> He that pays another his due, does an <hi>honest</hi> Action; but he does not do <hi>honestly,</hi> if against his Will, and by compulsion of Laws.</note> Action, tho' Honest, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truly virtuous, unless it be done out of Choice, and with a Good-will.

                  </note> others yet, who out of a Desire of improving their own Estates, or else a morose and unsociable sort of Temper, cry, <hi>They meddle with Nobody's Business but their own,</hi> that so they may seem to be Men of strict Honesty, and to Injure Nobody: and they do indeed avoid the one sort of Injustice, but directly run themselves into the other; for they desert the common Good and Society of Mankind, while they bestow neither Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Pains, nor Money toward the Preservation of it.

                  <p>Justice is alter'd upon an Alteration of Circumstances; and what was our Duty in one Case to do, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumstances 'tis our Duty to avoid.

               </argument>
               <p>BUt here 'tis observable, <note n="a" place="bottom">Having given an account of the Nature of Justice, and Injustice, with the Causes of this; he proceeds to shew, How, in several Cases, that which is usually a part of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, upon an alteration of Circumstances, becomes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For as a thing may be pleasing to the Palate, or healthful to the Body in some Circumstances, which is not so absolutely; as a Cup of bad Water to one in extream Thirst: So may an Action, which generally speaking is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and unreasonable; as the breaking of one's Promise, or the like; in some certain Cases become honest, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Right Reason.</note> That the Limits of Justice are not so fixt, but that they may be alter'd upon an alteration of the Circumstances; so that what at one time appears to be the Duty of an honest and good Man, at another is alter'd and becomes the quite contrary: To deliver up a Trust, for example, or perform a Promise, and other things relating to Truth and Faithfulness, are Duties which Justice it self will allow us, in several Cases, to <note n="b" place="bottom">The Word <hi>migrate</hi> signifies transitively here, as in some other places of this Author: So <hi>migrare communia jura</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>to transgress</hi> or <hi>violate</hi> 'em.</note> neglect or omit: For respect must be had to those general Rules we before laid down, as the Ground and Foundation of all Justice, <hi>First,</hi> That no Injury be done to any other. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64327:26"/>
That we make it our earnest Endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Good and Interest of all Mankind: So that our Duty is not always the same, but vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note n="c" place="bottom">By <hi>ea tempora,</hi> I suppose, he means those <hi>Cases</hi> or <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;</hi> for so he often uses the Word in this Work. He had just been saying, That nothing must be done contrary to the two great Rules of Justice before given: And then he adds, <hi>Ea cum tempor'd commutantur,</hi> that is, When the Case is such, as that the keeping one's Promise, or the like, would be acting contrary to one of those Rules, (that is, would be a great Injury to him that made it, or him to whom it was made, as he explains himself afterwards;) then our Duty is alter'd, and we are bound not to keep it; because, if we should, 'twould be a Breach of the fundamental Rule of that Virtue. This is the first Case, wherein a Man is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to be as good as his Promise.</note> according to the variety of Circumstances. There may be a Contract or Promise, for instance, the performance of which would bring very great Damage, either to the Person himself that made it, or the other Party whom it was made to. Thus, had <note n="d" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Naptune</hi> not granted what he promis'd to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus, Theseus</hi> had not suffered the loss of his Son <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polytus.</hi> For (as the Story goes) <hi>Neptune</hi> having grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him any three Wishes, for the third, he once in a very great passion, desired the Death of his own Son; by obtaining of which, he was afterwards brought into the greatest Afflictions. Such Promises therefore are <note n="e" place="bottom">Because the keeping of 'em would be an Offence against the first Rule of Justice, Not to do any Wrong: and if may be suppos'd the Person, to whom they were made, had he seen such a Mischief ensuing, would not have demanded it. <hi>See chap.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>Book</hi> 3.</note> not to be kept, as will but bring a Mischief on him they were made to; <note n="f" place="bottom">Because 'tis presum'd the Person, who made such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, had he thought of such a Damage likely to come of it, would not have made it. We promise as Men, who aren't infallible, and can't provide against every thing that may happen; wherefore we are suppos'd not to promise any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than what we now know; and should any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing happen in the mean time, 'tis to be taken as a thing, which we tacitly excepted. But here we must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed very warily and cautiously: this will hardly hold good in the case of a Promissory Oath, where God himself is call'd to witness. <hi>See</hi> Grot. de Jure B. &amp; P.

                  </note> no more are those, which tend to the Damage of the Promiser himself, more than to the Profit of him they were

Again, <note n="g" place="bottom">Another Case wherein a Man is dispenc'd from keeping his Promise, is, when some greater Duty requires his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the mean time.</note> even Justice it self requires us to perform a greater before a lesser Duty: You promise, for example, a Friend of yours, to assist him in a Cause that he has depending, but your Son grows dangerously sick in the mean time; here 'twould be no <note n="h" place="bottom">Because to take care of a Son's Life, is a greater Duty, than to assist a Friend; and therefore ought to take place before it.</note> breach of Duty in you, if you should not make good what you promis'd to your Friend; and he himself rather would be much to blame, should he complain of being disappointed by you. Further, <note n="i" place="bottom">Another Case wherein a Man is not oblig'd to perform his Promise, is, when he was forc'd to make it thro' Fear, or drawn to it by some Deceit. <hi>See the forecited Authors.</hi>
                  </note> 'tis plain to any one's Sence, that such sort of Promises can never be binding, as are made by People over-aw'd by Fear, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd by Deceit; most of which are void by the <note n="k" place="bottom">The Laws being deliver'd only in general Terms, and not being able to descend to all particular Cases, 'twas in the power of the Praetor, or Judge, to supply that Defect by his Edicts and Authority.</note> Praetor's Edicts, and some of 'em even by the Laws themselves. But another great Spring from which Injuries arise, is some Quirk or Cavil, and an over-subtle and malicious Interpretation of the Laws; from whence that Saying, <hi>Summum jus sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Injuria, The height of Justice is the height of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64327:27"/>
is now become a daily and common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb among us. There are frequent Examples of this to be met with in our Publick Transactions; as that of Him, for Example, who concluding a Truce with the Enemy for thirty Days, made continual Incursions into their Territory by Night; because, forsooth, the Truce was not made for so many Nights, but only so many Days. Just such a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pittiful Trick (if the Story be true) was that notable Cunning of <hi>Quintus Fabius Labeo</hi>'s; (or whoever the Man was, for I have it only by hear-say) who being by the Senate appointed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator, in a Difference between those of <note n="l" place="bottom">Two Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> about fourteen Miles distant from one another.</note> 
                  <hi>Nola</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> about their Bounds; when he came to the place that was appointed for the Treaty, took aside the Commissioners of either Party, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em privately, Not to be too eager and greedy in their Demands, but rather to take up and content 'emselves with less, than pretend to any more than what was honestly their Due. Both Parties did so according to his desire, so that a good quantity of Ground was left between them; this he e'en goes and adjudges to the <hi>Romans,</hi> leaving that to each Party, which they 'emselves had demanded. And is not this now to Deceive and Cheat, rather than to Judge? In all cases therefore such subtle kind of Tricks should be diligently avoided.</p>

There was one of 'em thought by a Trick to have eluded the force of his Oath, but was nevertheless punish'd for all that: His Shift was this; <hi>Hannibal</hi> had let 'em depart his Camp upon the Condition afore-mention'd; when therefore they had gotten a little way out of it, what does he do but come back to it again, under colour of having forgot to take something (I know not what) with him: And then away he goes out again, discharg'd (as he thought) from his Obligation of Returning. And so, 'tis very true, he was in Word, but not in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for in all such Oaths we aren't to attend to the meer Form of Words, but the true Design and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of 'em.

                  <p>Of Liberality, the second part of general Justice. Three Cautions to be observ'd concerning it.

               <p>WE have now gone thro' with the Subject of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, it <note n="a" place="bottom">In Chap. 7. he divided Justice, taken in its largest Extent, into <hi>Justice</hi> strictly so call'd, and <hi>Liberality:</hi> Having now fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd his Discourse upon the former of these, he proceeds to the latter in this Chapter, about which he first lays down three Cautions.</note> remains in the next place (to go on according to our Method propos'd) that we say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing likewise of Bounty and Liberality, than which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64327:32"/>
there is nothing more nearly ally'd to the Nature of Man. But then we must observe these following Cautions: <hi>First,</hi> That we take care in all Acts of Bounty, that they ben't <note n="b" place="bottom">As those who lend or give Money to young Spendthrifts, to help 'em forward and encourage 'em in their ill Courses, or the like; which is really a very great Injury to 'em.</note> prejudicial to those we would oblige by 'em, nor to any other Body. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> That we don't in our Bounty and Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty go beyond our Estates. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we duely proportion our Kindness, according to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Merit and Deserts. <note n="c" place="bottom">Having laid down his three Cautions, he proceeds in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to say something upon each of 'em. I take the <hi>Id enim</hi> therefore to referr to his first Caution, <hi>That our Bounty ben't really a Prejudice to any one;</hi> for <hi>to do no Wrong</hi> he laid down before, <hi>[chap.</hi> 7. <hi>and</hi> 10.] as the first fundamental Principle of Justice. His Caution was, <hi>that our Bounty should not be Hurtful,</hi> and here he gives his Reason for it, <hi>Id enim,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> For not to Hurt or Injure any body is the first and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Rule of Justice, which Justice ought to be the Measure of Bounty; nothing being Liberal (as he afterwards observes) but what is agreeable to the Rules of Justice.</note> And first of the former, which is grounded upon the great and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principle of all Justice, to which this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all its particular Instances should be referr'd. For he who pretending to do one a Kindness, does that which is really a Prejudice to him, is indeed so far from being Kind and Obliging, as that he ought to be counted a most pernicious Flatterer: and to do any manner of Injury to one, that you may shew your Generosity and Bounty to another, is just one and the same sort of Roguery and Injustice, as to Enrich your self by the Spoils of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Yet this is the Fault of a great many People, and especially those who are desirous of Glory, to take away from some that which justly belongs to 'em, that so they may have to bestow upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and they're apt to think 'emselves extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64327:32"/>
bountiful, if they Enrich their Adherents by any manner of means. But this is so far from being a Duty of Liberality, that nothing in the World can be more contrary to it. It ought to be therefore our first care in Giving, That what we bestow be a real Advantage and Kindness to our Friend, and no ways an Injury to any third Person. That Action therefore of <note n="d" place="bottom">The first after he had conquer'd <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great; and the second after he had conquer'd <hi>Marius</hi> in their Civil Wars.</note>

Beside that this over-great Bounty in Giving, is usually accompany'd with an answerable Desire and Greediness of Getting; which often proceeds even to down-right Oppression, that so Men may have wherewithal to supply this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Humor. One may also observe in a great many People, that they take a sort of Pride in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counted Magnificent, and give very plentifully, not from any generous Principle in their Natures, but only to appear Great in the Eye of the World;

               <argument>
                  <p>We should be most ready to give to those, who are most nearly ally'd to us. The first sort of Alliance is that between all Men in general. The Bond of it, and Duties resulting from it. We're bound to do for any Man what will be a Kindness to him, and no Prejudice to our selves; but with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That we don't thereby make our selves unable to assist those, who are more nearly ally'd to us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe <note n="a" place="bottom">He now proceeds to the fourth, but third plac'd <hi>[See ch.</hi> 14.] Ground of a Man's Meriting of us, <hi>The Nearness,</hi> &amp;c. I have added some Words to the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to make the Connexion with that foregoing appear the better.</note> fourth Inducement remaining to be spoke to, is, <hi>The nearness of Relation,</hi> or Society that is amongst Men; for the maintenance of which, we can't do better, than to give most to those, that stand nearest related to us. But that we may consider, with greater distinctness, the natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Human Society, we shall here trace it down from the Fountain head. The first thing then to be taken notice of is this, <note n="b" place="bottom">The first and most comprehensive Society, is that, which is between all Men, consider'd barely as they are Men: By which we are oblig'd to all those things, which we call Acts of meer Humanity; such as doing good to another, when 'twill be no prejudice to our selves, which by the Moralists are call'd, <hi>Res innoxiae utilitatis,</hi> of which he gives several Instances in this Chapter.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is such a thing as a Fellowship or Society between all Men in general:</hi> The Bond or Cement that holds this together, is Reason and Discourse, which by Teaching, Learning, Communicating one with another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> easily make Men agree together, and unite 'em all in one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sort of Conjunction and Community. Nor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64327:35"/>
does any thing set us at a greater distance from the Nature of Beasts: for we <hi>oftentimes</hi> talk of the Courage of <hi>them,</hi> such as Lyons and Horses; but <hi>never</hi> a word of their Equity, Justice or Goodness; And why is this; but <note n="c" place="bottom">Reason and Discourse are the Bonds of Society: where they are wanting therefore, there can be no Society, and by consequence no Justice, Equity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Virtues that consist in preserving Society.</note> because they are destitute of Reason and Discourse? This is then the largest and most comprehensive of all Societies, being made up of Men consider'd barely as such, and so taking in even the whole Race and Kind of 'em one with another: the <note n="d" place="bottom">The Duties incumbent on us by virtue of this Society are, <hi>First,</hi> To let every one have a share in those things, which by Nature are common; and what these are, he tells us immediately. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Not to break in upon another's Property. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In those things which are made our own, and become a Property, to be communicative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What he means by <hi>E quibus ipsis,</hi> &amp;c. I confess I don't very well understand, neither do any of the Commentators tell me; but I take the meaning of it to be, as I have translated it: so that <hi>quibus</hi> should relate to <hi>quae descripta sunt legibus,</hi> the things that are every one's own by Laws: Concerning which his first Rule was, <hi>That we should not break in upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Right;</hi> and then as to all other cases about 'em, he only puts us in mind of the <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb; the meaning of which is, <hi>That we should all count our selves Friends to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and practice accordingly.</hi>
                  </note> Duties of which are, To let every one have a share in those things, which by Nature were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd for the common Advantage and Benefit of all; To let what's already determin'd by Laws, and civil Constitutions, remain as it is, without breaking in upon any Man's Right; as to which things however we should remember a Rule, which is now among the <hi>Greeks</hi> become an usual Proverb, <hi>All things in common amongst Friends.</hi> But perhaps you may ask, what kind of things we suppose them to be, which ought to be common to all Mankind: <hi>Ennius</hi> has given us one Instance of 'em, which may easily be apply'd to a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<q>

                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64327:36"/>
He who directs the wandring Traveller,</l>

                     <l>Which gives him ne're the less of Light, for that</l>
                     <l>It gave another.</l>
                  </q>
By this one Case he sufficiently teaches us, That whatever Kindness can be done for another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Damage or Loss to our selves, 'tis our Duty to do it, tho' to never so much a Stranger. From hence have arisen those general Maxims and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Humanity, <hi>Not to deny one a little Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-water;</hi> or, <hi>The lighting his Fire by ours, if he has occasion: To give the best Counsel we are able to one who is in Doubt or Distress;</hi> which are things that do Good to the Person that receives them, and are no Loss or Trouble to him that confers them. Such things therefore, being by <hi>Nature common,</hi> should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be kept open for the free use of all Men: And of those which are <hi>our own</hi> we should always be giving something, that may contribute to the Benefit and Welfare of the whole. <note n="e" place="bottom">He puts in a necessary Caution about Giving, and letting our Things be in common; which he would have us carry no further than <hi>Ennius</hi>'s Rule prescribes; that is, We should not be so Communicative and Open-hearted to all in general, as to impoverish our selves, and put it out of our Power to assist those, who are more nearly ally'd to us. We must light indeed another's Candle by ours, but not so as to lose our own Light by it. Here we must proceed by the Measures of Prudence and Charity.</note> But because the Revenues of Particulars are small, and there are infinite numbers of those that Want, therefore is <note n="f" place="bottom">Viz. <hi>That</hi> of always Giving something out of what is <hi>our own,</hi> for the general Benefit.</note> this universal Bounty to be kept within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

                  </note> BUt there are several Degrees of Society and Fellowship amongst Mankind; for to take now our leave of that general and universal one already mention'd, there's a nearer among those who are all of the same Country, Nation or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; than which, nothing more knits and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites Men to one another. There is a closer yet among those, who are all of the same City; for a great many things are in common to Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, such as Markets, Temples, Walks, Ways, Laws, Privileges, Courts of Justice, Freedom of Votes, besides common Meetings and Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and abundance of Business and Entercourse
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64327:37"/>
with one another. But there's a stricter Bond of Alliance still, between those who belong to the same Family, as taking into it but a very small part of that vast and immense one of all Mankind. For there being by Nature implanted in all things a certain Desire of Begetting their Like, the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest and nearest of all Societies is between Man and Wife; then follows that between <hi>them</hi> and their Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards <hi>that</hi> of the whole Family, who inhabit together, and have all things in common; which is, as it were, the first beginning of a City, and Ground or Seed-plot of a whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Next to this comes the Bond of Relation between Brothers; as also between first and second Cosins; who growing too numerous to live in the same House, are sent out to others, as it were into new Colonies. Next after this follow Marriages and Alliances, and so a new Stock of Relations that way; from whence comes a new Propagation and Off-spring, which serves to give rise, as was said, to Commonwealths. Now that nearness of Blood, and the natural Love which arises from it, can't but endear Men to one another, is past all doubt; 'tis a very great matter to have the same <note n="b" place="bottom">The Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their Ancestors, which were kept for the Honour of all the Family, into how many Branches soever divided.</note> Relicks and Monuments of our Ancestors; to make use of the same <note n="c" place="bottom">Private Sacrifices or Ceremonies belonging to such or such Families in particular, which the Publick in general was no ways concern'd in: <hi>Cui praeter cognatos &amp; affines nemo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponebatur,</hi> says <hi>Valer.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64327:37"/>
of real Virtue and Honesty, from a certain agreement and likeness of their Manners, contract a Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Friendship one with another. For Virtue and Goodness (as we often observe) of necessity moves us where-ever we see it; and makes us all have a Love and Respect for that Person, in whom we discover it. And as every Virtue thus wins upon our Hearts, and even forces us to Love those we take to possess it; so more especially do Justice and Beneficence. But when <note n="d" place="bottom">Every Man has a Kindness for himself, and is in some measure pleas'd with his own Qualities and Way of Living; when therefore he sees another with the same Qualities, and that follows after the same Way of Life, he presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him as it were another <hi>self,</hi> and is accordingly pleas'd with <hi>him</hi> too; which seems to be the Reason why <hi>Like</hi> (as we say) <hi>loves to join with Like.</hi> When several therefore have the same Virtues and Perfections in 'em, every one is pleas'd with all the rest, as with himself, and they all become (as it were) one and the same Person, which is what <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> thought the Perfection of Friendship. <hi>See</hi> Aristot.

But when we have gone over all the Relations that are in the World, and thro'ly consider'd the Nature of each, we shall find that there's no one of greater Obligation, no one that's dearer and nearer to us, than that which we

all of us bear to the Publick. We have a tender Concern and Regard for our Parents, for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, our Kindred and Acquaintance; but the Love which we have for our Native Country swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up all other Loves whatever; for which there is no honest Man but would Die, if by his Death he could do it any necessary Service.

Again, There are certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Offices, which are more peculiarly owing to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64327:39"/>
some one sort of Relatives, than they are to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: In the Business (for Example) of getting in his Corn, 'tis our Duty rather to assist a <note n="b" place="bottom">Because <hi>getting in of Corn</hi> is a thing that more peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seems to be a part of Neighbourhood; and has nothing to do with Friendship and Kindred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

These things therefore, and such like Circumstances, should be well consider'd, in the Practice and Exercise of every Virtue; and our Minds should be brought to a kind of Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Familiarity with them; that so we may be quick at the Accounts of our Duty, and able by casting up all things together, to see at last what the Remainder is, and know what we owe to the several sorts and conditions of Men. For as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, Orator or Physician, however well skill'd in the Rules of his Art, can never be perfect without the assistance of Practice and Experience; just so it is in the Case now before us: Many have laid down the Rules and Precepts of <hi>Virtue</hi> and Good-living; (as I my self am doing at this very time) but there's moreover requir'd to a due degree of Height and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in <hi>it,</hi> that one accustom himself to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of 'em. And thus have I shewn how Virtue and Honesty (from which all our Duty does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flow) are deduc'd from those things, which concern the Society and Good of Mankind; which was the second General I propos'd to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of.</p>

and Honesty is deriv'd; whatever proceeds from a brave and exalted Mind, that's rais'd above For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and all the little Chances and Accidents of the World, is usually made most account of amongst Men. Hence in Reproaches we find there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common, than such things as these:
<q>
                     <l>For shame! young Men, and yet have Womens Hearts!</l>
                     <l>While this brave Woman plays the Man—</l>

Or something like this,

Whereas on the contrary in Praises or Panegyricks, those things that are done with a bravery of Mind, and have something of extraordinary Courage in 'em, (I know not how) we commend in a nobler and loftier Strain, than we do any thing else.

Men of great Souls are apt to be Ungovernable and Ambitious; which prompts 'em to Injustice.

               </argument>
               <p>BUt that sort of <note n="a" place="bottom">Fighting stoutly, and undergoing Dangers, is not enough to give a Man the Name and Reputation of Valour, unless he do it in a good Cause, by fair means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Courage which is seen in the Dangers and Fatigues of War, unless a Man be govern'd by the Rules of Justice, and fight for the Safety and Good of the Publick, and not for particular Ends of his own, is altogether blamable; and so far from being a part of true Virtue, that 'tis indeed a piece of the most barbarous Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Fortitude therefore is very well defin'd by the Stoick Philosophers, when they call it, <note n="b" place="bottom">'Tis not true Courage therefore to be bold in Sinning; nor is a sign of a faint-hearted Spirit, to be afraid of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what indeed is a Fault: There are some things (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> well observes) which a Man of true Courage ought to fear, and 'tis a shame for him not so do it. 'Twere well if this could be consider'd by some Men, who think it a brave and heroick piece of Greatness, to live in open Defiance of the Laws, and let the World see they arn't afraid of the Gallows: who defie Heaven out of a meer Bravado, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Almighty, that they mayn't seem such Cowards as to be afraid of Hell. The truth on't is, there's hardly any thing occasions more Evil in the World, than Men's having false Notions of this Virtue; and would they but take this Definition along with 'em, they would not talk so much of being Couragious in Wickedness, nor call others, Men of low, mean and pitiful Souls for being afraid of Sinning.</note> 
                  <hi>A Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue contending for Justice and Honesty.</hi> No man therefore by Baseness and Treachery has ever got the Name and Reputation of true Courage; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ever be Virtuous or Credible, that is not Just. To which purpose, that of <hi>Plato</hi> was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well said, <q>As that sort of Knowledge, which is not directed by the Rules of Justice,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64327:40"/>
ought rather to have the Name of <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Subtilty,</hi> than <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence;</hi> just so that bold and adventurous Mind, which is hurried by the Stream of its own Passions, and not for the Good and Advantage of the Publick, should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have the Name of <hi>Fool-hardy</hi> and <hi>Daring,</hi> than <hi>Valiant</hi> and <hi>Couragious.</hi>
                  </q> The first thing therefore I'd have in a truely couragious Man, is, <note n="c" place="bottom">These Words must be taken in a limited Sence, not as tho' Cunning and Stratagem were unlawful, but only as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of Perfidiousness and Treachery.</note> That he be a Follower of Goodness and fair Dealing, of Truth and Sincerity; which are principal and constituent parts of Justice. But here 'tis one very unhappy thing, that most times these great and exalted Minds are naturally ungovernable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of Rule: So that what <hi>Plato</hi> observ'd of the <hi>Spartans, That all their Customs had no other Aim, but to get the Superiority,</hi> may fitly enough be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to these Persons: for the more any Man has of this Greatness of Soul, the more eager he is of being a Sharer in the Government, or rather of obtaining it wholly to himself: And 'tis no easie matter to be fair and equitable in all one's Actions, (which is the proper and peculiar Office of Justice) while one is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make himself uppermost. From hence it comes to pass, that they'll never be conquer'd in any Debates, or over-rul'd by the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64327:41"/>
of the Publick; but make it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by Factions and Bribery to get a strong Party and Interest in the Republick; and rather choose to be Uppermost by Force and Injustice, than E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to others by fair and upright Dealing. But the difficulty of it can only serve to make it more Honourable, <note n="d" place="bottom">I have added these Words to my Author, because the Sence seems plainly to require 'em, or something like 'em. He had just been saying, That Men of great Souls are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apt to run into Jnjustice, for the raising of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; and that 'tis very difficult for 'em not to do so: But fearing lest this should be urg'd as an Excuse for 'em, he takes care to prevent it by saying, That the Difficulty of it enhances the Credit; and then adds, <hi>Nullum est enim, &amp;c.</hi> which words seem to give a Reason why the Difficulty of adhering to Justice in this case, will by no means serve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse Injustice: <hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>no sort of Case,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>but never its contrary more Excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> For no sort of Case or Circumstance whatever, can excuse any Man for being guilty of Injustice. Those are therefore your truly brave and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, not who Rob, Plunder and Injure others, but those who Secure and Protect 'em from Injuries. But that Greatness of Mind, which is <hi>truly</hi> such, and under the direction of Wisdom and Prudence, makes that Honour and Credit, which we natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire, not consist in the outward imaginary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, but in the real intrinsick Goodness of its Actions; and is not so eager of <hi>appearing</hi> to be greater and better than others, as of <hi>really being so.</hi> For he that is so mean as to depend upon the giddy and ignorant Multitude, ought never to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a truly great and exalted Spirit: Besides that, there's nothing so easily draws Men to Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, as a Loftiness of Mind, when joyn'd with this foolish Desire of Applause. <note n="e" place="bottom">That is, He that has gotten this Loftiness of Mind, is in very great danger of being desirous of Applause, (very few being otherwise) and by consequence, of falling into Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: and therefore he ought to be the more careful as to this particular.</note> This is indeed a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64327:41"/>
very dangerous Place, and requires our greatest Concern and Watchfulness; because you shall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find any Man, that, when he has gone thro' La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Difficulties, does not expect this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Applause, as a kind of Reward for his Courage and Atchievements.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOw all true Courage and Greatness of Mind <note n="a" place="bottom">Having shewn in the former Chapter what the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites of true Courage are, <hi>viz.</hi> Justice, Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that 'tis opposite to Ambition, Vain-glory and Ungovernableness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he goes on now to shew wherein it consists, and what those things are, which 'tis concern'd about.</note> is more especially seen in these two things: The <hi>first</hi> is a generous Contempt or Disregard of all <note n="b" place="bottom">Such are Riches, Honours, Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which 'tis the part of the greatest Soul not to be a Slave to. We call a Soul either <hi>great</hi> or <hi>little,</hi> according to the things which we find it affected with; there being always a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Faculties and the Object. Thus Children that have gotten but little Souls, are concern'd about little and trivial Objects; which afterward, as their Faculties enlarge, they come to leave off and despise by degrees. He therefore is a Man of true Fortitude and Greatness of Soul, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about none but the greatest Objects, <hi>viz.</hi> Virtue and Vice, Happiness and Misery: who is above all lesser Concerns in the World, such as Pleasure or Pain, Riches or Poverty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and never suffers himself so much to regard 'em, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be puft up at the one, or dejected at the other. Hence he is never disquieted either with <hi>fears</hi> of Evil, <hi>hopes</hi> of Good, or any other Passion; but however the World goes, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep an even Temper of Soul. From hence result Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Consistency or Regularity in his Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> outward Goods, proceeding from an Opinion, That 'tis unworthy of a Man <hi>to admire,</hi> or wish for, or
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64327:42"/>
endeavour after any thing, unless it be that which is Honest and Becoming; <hi>to</hi> make himself subject to any one's Will; <hi>to</hi> be a Slave to his own irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Passions; or any ways depend upon the Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's of Fortune. When he has gotten such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind as I have now been describing, then the <hi>second</hi> thing is, That he <note n="c" place="bottom">This is not necessary to all Fortitude; for if it were, then those Men who live a Life of Retirement, could never be said to have that Virtue: which yet he affirms afterwards.</note> perform such Actions as are glorious and profitable, but withal very full both of Labour and Difficulty; and extreamly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to his Life it self, as well as to those things that are requisite for its Preservation. Now <note n="d" place="bottom">'Tis the doing of great and profitable Actions, that makes a Man glorious and splendid and useful to his Country: but 'tis that firm Temper and Resolution of Mind, which is the cause that makes him venture to do such Actions; which he therefore calls the <hi>causa &amp; ratio efficiens magnos viros,</hi> which has something more in it than <hi>Ground-work and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>
                  </note> all the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of these two parts, nay and I add all their <hi>Usefulness</hi> too, is lodg'd only in the latter; but the Ground-work, as 'twere, and Foundation of all true Greatness, is laid in the former. For in that are contain'd those generous Principles which exalt Mens Minds, and raise 'em to a Contempt of all worldly things. But that former it self is made up of two parts, The <hi>first</hi> is an Opinion that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64327:42"/>
nothing is truely and really Good, but only what is Honest: The <hi>second</hi> a Freedom from all sort of Passion or Disturbance of Mind. For what can more discover a Man of a brave and heroick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than to make no account in the World of those things, which seem so glorious and dazling to the generality of Mankind; but wholly to despise 'em, not from any vain and fantastick Humour, but from solid and firm Principles of Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Or what can more shew a robust Mind and unshaken Constancy, than to bear those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and numerous Calamities, which are incident to Mankind in this Life, with such a firm Temper and Fixedness of Soul, as never to offend against Nature and Right Reason, or do any thing that's unworthy the Dignity and Character of a Wise Man? Now 'twould not at all be consistent or agreeable, that he who bore up so couragiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Fear,</hi> should be afterwards unable to resist <hi>Desire;</hi> or that he who could never be conquer'd by <hi>Pain,</hi> should suffer himself to be captivated by <hi>Pleasure.</hi> These things therefore should well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, and of all <note n="e" place="bottom">Since Fortitude in great measure consists in a freedom from the Passions, of which <hi>Desire</hi> is one; from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that whoever is taken with an over-great <hi>Desire</hi> of any thing, offends against this Virtue. For this reason he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses here against the Desire of <hi>Money, Honour,</hi> &amp;c. as Vices opposite to Greatness of Soul. He brought 'em in before Chap. 8. as Causes of Positive Injustice.</note> Desires, that of <hi>Money</hi> should be avoided; for nothing's a greater Sign of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, mean and sordid Spirit, than to dote upon Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; nor is any thing on the contrary more Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Magnificent, than to contemn Wealth, if you have it not; and if you have it, to lay it out freely in Acts of Bounty and Liberality. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Glory (as I before observ'd) ought also to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64327:43"/>
be avoided: for it <note n="f" place="bottom">For who are greater Slaves than those who stand for Places? Or what Servant more depends upon the Beck of his Master, than the ambitious Man upon the Humour and Good-will of the Multitude?</note> robs a Man wholly of his Freedom and Liberty, which generous Spirits ought of all things in the World to maintain and defend. Neither ought Places of Power to be sought after; but at some times rather to be refus'd when offer'd, at others, be laid down if they can conveniently. We should free our selves, in short, from all vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Passions and Disorders of Mind, not only those of <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> but also of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Anger;</hi> that so the State of the Mind may be calm and undisturb'd, which will make the whole Life become graceful and <note n="g" place="bottom">By <hi>Constantia</hi> here, as in most other places, he does not mean that, which we commonly call <hi>Constancy;</hi> but that which the Poets call <hi>Consistency</hi> in a Character, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or Agreement between all the Parts of it, so that one doth not thwart and contradict another: which can never proceed from any thing else, but a perpetual Subjection of the Passions and Appetites to the Commands of Reason. For the Passions are irregular and inconsistent with one another; sometimes up and sometimes down; sometimes hurrying a Man this way, other times that. <hi>See Note</hi> 2. <hi>on Chap.</hi> 29.</note> uniform.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64327:44"/>
are attended with some Shame and Dishonour. <note n="b" place="bottom">This he adds as a Reason of the Words immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going: He had just been saying, That retir'd Men did well in despising and neglecting Places of Honour; but that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al they were afraid of Shame and Disgrace, which a Man of a great Soul ought not to be. This might seem odd, That one who despis'd Honour, should yet be afraid of a little Disgrace; to confirm it therefore, he presently adds, <hi>For you shall,</hi> &amp;c.</note> For you shall often find there's a great many Men, who are very inconsistent with 'emselves in things of a contrary Nature: as for <hi>Pleasure,</hi> they despise it with all the Severity of a Stoick; but yet are so effeminate, as not to be able to bear the least <hi>Trouble;</hi> are mighty Contemners of <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Applause;</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly concern'd at any thing of <hi>Disgrace:</hi>

                     <hi>Viz.</hi> For a Man to despise Pleasure, and yet not be able to bear Pain; or to contemn Applause, and yet be afraid of being a little Ill-spoken of.</note> which are things that don't very well agree together. Those People then, whom Nature has endow'd with Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for that purpose, <note n="d" place="bottom">Gentlemen therefore, and others, who have Parts and Abilities for that purpose, should not think they are born for themselves alone, but to serve their Country, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.

                  </note> But that Greatness of Soul, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all Human things, (which we have often mention'd) together with that Calmness and Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mind, is requisite in those of a publick Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as much, if not more than 'tis in Philosophers,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64327:45"/>
if ever they hope to be free from Anxieties, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any Steadiness or Uniformity in their Lives. Now these things are easier to Philosophers, than to them; for as much as their Lives, being led in private, require for their support a less number of things, and have fewer within the power and reach of Fortune: and if any ill Accident should befal 'em, 'tis impossible their Sufferings can be very considerable. Those Men therefore that are in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Stations, <note n="f" place="bottom">Our Passions are apt to rise in proportion to their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Philosophers therefore, and those who live quiet and retir'd Lives, having very little Business or Concern in the World, can have nothing so great, as very mightily to move either their Hopes or their Fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But your Men of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, being concern'd in the Affairs of a Kingdom or State, must needs be more liable to the Insults of these Passions.</note> having things of more weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to be taken care of, must in reason be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to lye much more open to the Assaults of the Passions, than those who spend their Days in Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Retirement. Upon which account they should take the more care, to fortifie themselves with this Greatness of Spirit, and to free their Minds from the grievous Torments and Disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of 'em. But he who takes upon him a Publick Trust, should not only look that the Business be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, but that he himself be qualified for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it. In considering of which there's a double Extream to be carefully avoided, That he neither Despair thro' a mean Cowheartedness; nor yet be over Confident thro' Eagerness of Desire. And lastly, in whatever he sets about, let all things be diligently and carefully put in order, before he goes on to the execution of it.</p>

                     <hi>'Tis no less great and commendable to Manage Affairs of Peace, than of War. Several Examples to prove this.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt seeing most People are apt to imagin, that 'tis greater and more glorious to Manage Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of War, than Peace; <note n="a" place="bottom">Before he lays down any particular Rules about the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Fortitude, he compares the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> together, and gives the Preference to the former.</note> I shall endeavour to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen this general Opinion. For the Greatness of that Glory, which is given to Warriors, has made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, for no other reason, desirous of Quarrels; especially Men of the greatest Parts and most aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Minds; particularly if they are qualify'd for a Soldier's Life, and their Disposition carry 'em to the Profession of Arms. But if we would make a just Estimate of the case, we should find both greater and more glorious Actions done by Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at home, than by Arms abroad. For what tho' <note n="b" place="bottom">A famous <hi>Athenian</hi> General, by whose Prudence and Conduct especially, the <hi>Greeks</hi> conquer'd <hi>Xerxes</hi> in that great Battle at the Island <hi>Salamis. See his Life in</hi> Plut. <hi>and</hi> Corn. Nep.</note> 
                  <hi>Themistocles</hi> be deservedly Commended, and his Name more Illustrious than that of <note n="c" place="bottom">An eminent Philosopher and Lawgiver of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> one of the seven Wise Men of <hi>Greece,</hi> who is suppos'd by some to have first instituted their great Council of <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi> His Life is written by <hi>Plut. Aristotle</hi> indeed, and some others, tell us, That he did not first set on foot, but only confirm'd the Council of <hi>Areopagus,</hi> whereas he abolish'd most other things in the former Constitution. For which reason <hi>Langius</hi> will have <hi>Cicero</hi> mean by the Word <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit</hi> here, no more than <hi>stabilivit</hi> or <hi>confirmavit,</hi> confirm'd or establish'd.</note>

And tho' <hi>Salamis</hi> be brought for the proof of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which is far to be prefer'd to the Wisdom of <hi>Solon,</hi> in constituting and setling the Senate of <hi>Areopagus?</hi> Yet in truth ought <hi>this</hi> to be judg'd no less great and extraodinary than <hi>that:</hi> for <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s Victory was only a Kindness to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth once; but <hi>Solon</hi>'s Counsel will be so for ever: Seeing 'tis by <hi>this</hi> that the Laws of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and Constitutions of their Ancestors are kept up and maintain'd. Beside, <hi>Themistocles</hi> can name nothing in the World, wherein he assisted the <hi>Areopagus:</hi> but <hi>Solon</hi> on his part may truly say, That he, by his Wisdom, was assisting to <hi>Themistocles;</hi> for the War was carried on by the Directions of that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which he by his Prudence at first appointed. The same may be said of <note n="d" place="bottom">Two famous <hi>Spartan</hi> Generals, who got several Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and made <hi>Lacedaemox</hi> the Empress of all <hi>Greece. See their Lives in</hi> Corn. Nep.</note> 
                  <hi>Pausanias</hi> and <hi>Lysander;</hi> for tho' by their Valour they are thought to have enlarg'd the Dominion of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> yet 'tis by no means at all to be compar'd with the Laws and Discipline of the wise <note n="e" place="bottom">A Noble and most Wise Lawgiver of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who, as long as they liv'd up to his Discipline, were one of the bravest Nations in the World. <hi>His Life is at large in</hi> Plut.</note>

                  <hi>Nasica,</hi> tho' a meer private Citizen at the same time. 'Tis true, this Action had something of the Soldier in it, as being done by Force and down-right Violence, and so does not wholly come under the Notion of Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns: however, I have brought it as an Instance of these, because 'twas effected by this Civil sort of Prudence, and without the Assistance of a Military Power. I can't but therefore still extreamly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of that Saying of mine, which I'm told some malicious and envious Fellows most mightily carp at,

                  </q>
For not to say any thing of other People, when I my own self sat at the Helm of the Government, did not <hi>Arms</hi> then give place to the <hi>Gown?</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="bottom">By the Conspiracy of <hi>L.

                  <p>The Body ought to be so far taken Care of, as that it may be able to bear Fatigues. But 'tis the Mind that truly makes Great Men. War should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken only for the sake of Peace. The Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Great Soul and a Great Understanding; and the Duties of each. Fighting one of the least parts of Courage.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw 'tis certain <hi>that</hi> Virtue, which consists in Greatness and Elevation of Soul, and makes up the Subject of our present Enquiry, is obtain'd by the Strength of the Mind, not the Body. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Body ought not to be neglected; but by Exercise brought to such a Frame and Condition, as that it may obey the Prescriptions of the Mind, in performing that Business and bearing those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, which are requir'd of it. But still the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Virtue we are seeking for, consists in due care and application of Mind; in which particular, the Publick receives as much Benefit from Gowns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who manage and take care of its Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; as it doth from Soldiers, who are Generals of its Armies. For they by their Prudence have often either hindred the breaking out of Wars, or else have occasion'd their speedy Conclusion; and sometimes too have been the cause of their being Undertaken: as the third with <hi>Carthage</hi> was entred into upon the

Advice of <note n="a" place="bottom">The Elder <hi>Cato,</hi> who was Sirnam'd <hi>Censorius,</hi> from his Severity when Censor.

                  <hi>Cato,</hi> whose Credit and Authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd in that Case, even after he was dead. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom therefore, and Skill in determining Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, is more to be desir'd than Courage in Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But then we must always be careful in this Case, that our Design be not the avoiding of War, but the being more useful and serviceable to the Publick. <note n="b" place="bottom">Having determin'd the Question, Whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary</hi> Conduct be better; he now proceeds to give some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about the latter; That we should never undertake War but for the sake of Peace: Not be cast down at Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end of the next Chapter.</note> And as for War, it should never be undertaken with any other Aim, but only that of obtaining an honourable Peace.

And as this is the part of an exalted Spirit, so is what follows of an elevated Understanding; to discover Effects even while they are yet in the Wombs of their Causes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider before-hand whatever may happen on either side, and accordingly what's to be done when it <hi>does</hi> happen; that so he may never be taken una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and brought to that lamentable shift of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>I never once thought of it.</hi> These are the Duties, as of a truly Courageous and Lofty, so of a Wise and Judicious Mind; but rashly to run and lay about one in Battel, and come to Wounds and

down-right Blows with an Enemy, is but a savage and brutish kind of Business: However, Necessity so requiring, a Man should Fight, and choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to part with his Life than his Liberty, or be guilty of any base or dishonourable Action.</p>

of some, that they count it more noble to manage Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of War, than of Peace; so you shall find there are a great many others, who imagine, that hot and adventurous Undertakings have something that's greater and more glorious in 'em, than wisely cool and deliberate Counsels. Now as no Man ought, by too warily avoiding of Dangers and Labours, to get himself the name of a Faint-heart and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; so, on the other hand, Care should be taken, that we thrust not our selves into Hazards and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, where there's no manner of occasion for it; than which there is no greater Folly upon Earth. 'Tis a Duty therefore, in Attempts of any Danger, to imitate the Practice of skilful Physicians, who always to light and inconsiderable Diseases, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply none but easie and gentle Remedies; but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Cases are forc'd to have recourse to despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Cures.

Thus <hi>Callicratidas,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Sparta,</hi> in the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War, after he had done many signal Services, at last was the occasion of Ruining all; for when he was advis'd to Retreat with his Navy from <note n="f" place="bottom">Two or three little Islands adjoyning to the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> between that and the Isle <hi>Lesbos;</hi> where the <hi>Athenians,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of <hi>Thrasibulus,</hi> gave a mighty Overthrow to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who were led by <hi>Callicratidas;</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being slain in the Action. <hi>See Book</hi> 15. <hi>of</hi> Diod.

                     <hi>Two Rules of</hi> Plato<hi>'s to be observ'd by those who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the State. The Good of the Govern'd ought to be their sole Aim. An excellent Description of a good Minister of State. Ambition very destructive in a Government. A good Saying of</hi> Plato<hi>'s to that purpose. Men should carry themselves civilly towards those, who are of an opposite Party in the State; and not count 'em their Enemies. The Example of</hi> Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio <hi>and</hi> Metellus. <hi>Anger towards an Adversary no part of Courage. Affability,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>requisite in a Statesman. Severity and Chastisements sometimes necessary; and Rules to be observ'd about 'em. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be well done, that's done in a Passion, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers should be like the Laws themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THose who design to be Partakers in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be sure to remember these two Precepts of <hi>Plato: First,</hi> To make the Safety and Interest of their Citizens, the great Aim and Design of all their Thoughts and Endeavours; without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver considering their own personal Advantage. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> so to take care of the whole collective Body of the Republick, as not to serve the Interest of any one Party, to the Prejudice or Neglecting of all the rest. For the Government of a State is much like the Office of a Guardian or Trustee; which should always be manag'd for the good of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, and not of the Persons to whom he is entrusted. And those Men, who, whilst they take care of one, neglect or disregard another part of the Citizens, do but occasion Sedition and Discord, the most destructive things in the World to a State: From whence it comes to pass, that, while some take part with the Popular Faction, and others make their Court to every Great One, there's but very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64327:51"/>
few left, who are concern'd for the Benefit and Good of the whole. From this Root have sprung many grievous Dissentions amongst the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> and not only Tumults, but even deadly Civil Wars in our own Republick: things which a worthy and truly brave Citizen, and one who deserves to hold the Reins of the Govenment, will shun and detest; and will give himself so to the Service of the Publick, as to aim at no Riches or Power for himself; and will so take care of the whole Community, as not to pass over any one part of it: Such a one will scorn, by the mean Arts of Calumny and a false Accusation, to bring others into Hatred and Disrepute with the People; but will always adhere to what is Just and Honest, and ne'r be drawn from it, whatever Offence may be taken by others; nay, will rather part with his Life it self, than do any thing that is contrary to the Virtues I have mention'd. Eager Ambition, and contending for Honours, is, of all things, most rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and destructive to a State; concerning which, <hi>Plato</hi> has said admirably well, <q>That for Men to contend and fall out with one another, about which should be Chief in the Management of the State, is just as if the Ship's Crew should go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ears, about who should be Master or Pilot of the Vessel.</q> And the same Philosopher has given us this for a Rule, <q>That only those Men should be reckon'd as Enemies, who have taken up Arms in opposition to the Republick; not those who would govern it after their own Schemes.</q> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">The Quarels between Citizens are of two sorts, 1. <hi>Civil,</hi> when each desires the Good of the Publick, but take several ways of arriving at it; such was this here mention'd. The other <hi>Hostile,</hi> when one endeavours to Ruine, the other to Uphold the State; such was that between <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi>
                  </note> Such was the Dissention between

                  <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>P. Africanus</hi> the Younger, and that <hi>Metellus</hi> who was sirnam'd <hi>Macedonicus,</hi> from his Conquest of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> They always rivall'd and oppos'd one another in the Affairs of the Publick, but never so, as to become inveterate Enemies.</note> 
                  <hi>P. Africanus</hi> and <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> without any great Bitterness or Animosities between 'em. Some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think it the part of a brave and heroick Spirit, to shew heat of Anger and Passion against an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary; but what they say is by no means to be regarded: for it's certain on the other hand, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing's more laudable, nothing more worthy of a great and brave Person, than Clemency, Meekness and Gentleness of Spirit. In Cities that are Free, and where all Men in common enjoy the same Privileges, Courtesie and Affability, and that which they call <hi>altitudo animi,</hi> a calm and undisturbed Temper of Mind, are peculiarly requisite: For to fret upon every unseasonable Visit, or at every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and troublesom Petitioner, makes a Man sowre and morose in his Humour; which as it brings no kind of Good to himself, so it gets him the Hatred and Ill-will of others. But tho' Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Clemency be laudable Virtues, yet no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than as they leave room for a just Severity, whenever the Occasions of the Publick require it; without which a City can never be well govern'd. Now <note n="c" place="bottom">He had been saying, a Governour should be Meek and Courteous, but not so as to exclude Severity, when occasion requires it: This naturally brought him to discourse, How Criminals should be punish'd; which he does by laying down several Rules; as, <hi>First, That no ill Language be given 'em,</hi> &amp;c.</note> every Reproof and Chastisement, <hi>in the first place,</hi> should be always free from contumelious Language, and not inflicted for the sake of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son chastizing or reproving another, but the good and advantage of the whole Republick. Diligent care should be taken, <hi>in the next place,</hi> that the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64327:52"/>
Penalty be proportion'd to the nature of the Crime, and that some don't pass without ever being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd, while others are punish'd for the same Misdemeanours. But of all things, Anger should be excluded in Punishing; for whoever comes to this Work in a Passion, will never observe that due Mediocrity, which equally abstains from too much and too little, so strictly requir'd by the <note n="d" place="bottom">The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> hold, That the Passions, <hi>viz.</hi> Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in 'emselves neither Good nor Bad, but accordingly as they are made either good, or ill Use of; and that they are given us by Nature for very good Ends and Purposes, if we don't let 'em get the upper-hand of our Reason, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 'em to a certain Mediocrity and Temperament. But the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero</hi> follows in this Book, said the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were absolutely in themselves evil, call'd 'em Diseases and Infirmities of the Mind; and commanded their Wise Man, not to moderate, but wholly to root out all Anger, Joy, Compassion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

'Tis a good Rule therefore, I think, which is given by some Men, <hi>That the higher our Station in the World is, the more care we should take of our Lives and Actions, that they be kept within the compass of Lowliness and Humility. Panaetius</hi> tells us 'twas an usual Saying with his Schollar and familiar Friend <hi>Africanus,</hi> 
                  <q>That Men who give the Reins to their vitious Appetites, and are high and presuming upon the Greatness of their Fortunes, should be dealt with like Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when grown fierce and unruly by frequent Engagements: for as <hi>these</hi> are deliver'd to Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to tame and be made fit for riding; so <hi>those</hi> should be brought within the barriers and limits of Reason and Philosophy, to teach 'em the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of all Human Things, and the great Volubility and Changeableness of Fortune.</q> We should also in Prosperity more especially make use of the Counsel of our Friends, and pay more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Deference to their Advices, than we were wont to do. At the same time also we should take a great care, that we don't give over-much ear to Flatterers, nor suffer our selves to be wheedled and impos'd upon by their deceitful Words. For there's nothing wherein we're more apt to be mistaken, than in this particular; every one having such a fond Conceit and Opinion of himself, as to think he deserves those Applauses which they give him. Hence spring innumerable Errors in our Lives; whilst Men, puff'd up with a vain Imagination, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64327:53"/>
mistaken Notions of their own great Merit, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Railery of all the World besides. And so much may suffice upon this Head. From what has been said we may easily gather, That those who are over Affairs of the Publick, do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Actions, and such as express the most Bravery of Mind; their Business affording 'em more Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and there being more Men who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in <hi>this,</hi> than in any <hi>other</hi> Method of Living whatever. <note n="d" place="bottom">Having done with the <hi>publick,</hi> he comes now to the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Fortitude.

Of the latter, which relates to <hi>private</hi> Gentlemen, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging their own Estates, he gives a few Precepts; as, <hi>First,</hi> That their Estate be well gotten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>WE are now in the next place to speak of the fourth, and only remaining part of Virtue or Honesty, under which are comprehended Bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Temperance, Modesty, Government of the Passions, and the observing a just Order as to time and place in our Words and Actions; from all which arises <note n="a" place="bottom">By these Words I would express our Author's <hi>quasi or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus quidam vitae,</hi> by which 'tis likely he might mean the same, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> did by their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> comprehends under the Virtue of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 'Tis that which gives a Lustre and Ornament to Virtue, like the polishing of a Diamond, which makes it more pleasing and valuable than when rugged, tho' then it exceeded all other Stones. Thus we see some have a way to set off and recommend their Virtue; while others by their too great Severity and Rigidness, for want of this <hi>ornatus,</hi> which he here mentions, render both it and themselves Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastful.</note> a certain engaging kind of Beauty and Gracefulness, which serves to set off and adorn our Lives. Under this Head is contain'd that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingness <hi>[Decorum,</hi> as we call it in Latin] which among the <hi>Greeks</hi> has the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64327:54"/>
is in its Nature so closely united and riveted to Honesty, that there's no way left of pulling 'em a sunder: for whatever is <hi>Becoming</hi> is likewise <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> and whatever is <hi>Honest</hi> is likewise <hi>Becoming.</hi> The Difference between 'em is so very small, that we may better conceive what it is, than explain it; for <note n="b" place="bottom">That is, Honesty is as it 'twere the Foundation of Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, which 'tis built upon; it being impossible for any thing to <hi>become,</hi> unless it be first Honest. I could wish however our Author had endeavour'd to explain the Difference he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood between 'em, and not contented himself with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, That it might better be conceiv'd than in Words express'd. The Nature of <hi>Honesty</hi> seems to consist in the Conformity of our Actions to the Judgment of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> as the Rule or Measure which a reasonable Creature ought to walk by: But that of <hi>Decorum,</hi> in our Actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answerable to the Dignity and Excellence of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a Character which we ought to live up to in the World. Now nothing can be so, that is not first suppos'd conformable to the Dictates of Reason: and whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Judgment of Reason, must of consequence be worthy of a Man. For what can be worthy of a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, but to live according to that Reason which God has giv'n him? From hence it follows, that <hi>Decorum</hi> does as 'twere result from <hi>Honestum,</hi> as Light does from the Sun; or (to give our Author's own Explication of it) as Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good Colour in the Face, doth from a good Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body.</note> whatever Becomingness there is in any Action, it immediately arises from the Honesty of it. From hence it appears, that Becomingness does not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly belong to this one part of Honesty, whereof we are now undertaking to Discourse; but shews it self also in each of the three former. <note n="c" place="bottom">He shews in particular, how Decorum is seen in the three former Virtues, <hi>Prudence, Justice, Fortitude.</hi>
                  </note> To Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for instance, and Discourse according to the Rules of <hi>Prudence;</hi> to go about nothing but after

due Consideration; and on every occasion to be quick at espying and defending the Truth, are things that are <hi>Becoming:</hi> whereas to be deceiv'd, to be in an Errour or Mistake, and to be impos'd upon, are very <hi>Unbecoming,</hi> as well as to be mad or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side one's self. So again, all Actions of <hi>Justice</hi> are <hi>Becoming,</hi> but those of Injustice are both Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Unbecoming. The same may be said as to the Actions of <hi>Fortitude;</hi> whatever is done with a manful Courage and bravery of Mind, as 'tis <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of, so it <hi>becomes</hi> a Man; but whatever on the other hand shews any Cowardice or Meanness of Spirit, is as contrary to Becomingness, as it is to true Virtue. I conclude therefore, That the Decency whereof I am now discoursing, appertaineth to each of the four parts of Honesty; and so apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, as not to stand in need of any mighty reach of Understanding to perceive it; but is easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable at the first view: for there's something of Becoming contain'd in the very Notion and Idea of all Virtue, from which 'tis distinguish'd by the Mind alone, and not by the Nature of the thing it self. Just as the Beauty and good Colour of the Countenance, can never be separate from the Health of the Body; so this Becomingness, of which we are speaking, in it self is all one, and, as it were, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with Virtue and Honesty; but may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd from it by Thought and Imagination. Now there are <hi>two kinds</hi> or sorts of it; the one <note n="d" place="bottom">This is that we have spoken of in the Note above, which is the immediate Off-spring of, and necessarily results from the Nature of Honesty in general.</note>

                  <hi>that excellent part of the Nature of Man, by which he is distinguish'd from the rest of the Creation.</hi> As for the latter, which is contain'd under this, 'tis most commonly made to consist in <hi>that, which is so agreeable to the Nature of Man, as</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat this is so, will more plainly appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that <hi>Decorum</hi> or Convenience of Manners,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64327:56"/>
which the Poets aim at in all their Writings; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which were it anywise necessary to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Purpose, I might largely discourse. Suffice it at present for me only to observe, That the Poets are then said to keep this Decorum, when each of their Persons is brought in saying and doing those things, which are suitable to the Character he bears in the World: Should <note n="a" place="bottom">Two of the Sons of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> suppos'd to have been very Just and Good Men; therefore, after their Deaths, made two of the Judges of Hell.</note>

'twould be an Offence against the Rules of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;</hi> because they pass in the World for Men of Justice and Honesty: But let the same be said by a cruel <hi>Atreus,</hi> and the whole Theatre shall clap and applaud it; because 'tis a Saying very agreeable to his Character. <note n="d" place="bottom">There's a difference between the Poetical and Moral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum: The <hi>Poet</hi> himself can give such or such a Character, (a vicious one if he pleases) and his Decorum consists in the Person's speaking and doing what's agreeable to such a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But <hi>Nature (i. e.</hi> the God of Nature) has given one to every of us, by making us reasonable understanding Creatures. As therefore a poetical Person must speak and do what's suitable to his Character; so are we bound in all our Thoughts, Words and Actions, to follow the Dictates of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Right Reason; in which consists the Nature of universal Decorum.</note> Now the Poet can judge what is becoming and convenient for every Person, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Character he himself has fix'd on him; but Nature has fix'd one on every one of us, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us that Nobleness and Excellence of Being, whereby we are set above all other Creatures.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64327:56"/>
The Poets then, there being so great a variety of Characters, can see what's becoming and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for all, even the most Vitious: but we have got only one Character to live up to, I mean that which is assign'd us by Nature herself; a <hi>Character</hi> of Temperance and Modesty, of Constancy and Moderation. And the same Nature having also taught us, That we ought to be careful of our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Demeanour towards the rest of Men; from hence it appears of how large an Extent that Becomingness is, which belongs to the Nature of <note n="e" place="bottom">Which consists in living up to that Character of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Nature has given us.</note> 
                  <hi>Honesty in general;</hi> and also that other, which is seen in the Exercise of the <note n="f" place="bottom">Which consists in being careful of our Carriage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour towards the rest of Men, which the same Nature has taught us to be; in giving no Offence to any one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>several kinds of it.</hi> For, as the Beauty and Comliness of the Body draws the Eyes to it by the fit Composure of all its Members, and pleases us only upon this account, because all its Parts correspond with a kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and Harmony: So this Decorum, which gives a sort of Lustre and Grace to our Lives, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages the Approbation and Esteem of all we live with, by that just and due Order, Consistency, and Regularity, which it keeps and maintains in our Words and Actions. <note n="g" place="bottom">Men ought to frame and compose their Actions, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own <hi>private</hi> Will and Fancy, but according to the Prescriptions and Manners of those, with whom they converse; so far as is innocent and not contrary to Virtue; to be easie and compliant in Things indifferent, and by a civil, gentile and affable Deportment, endeavour to oblige and win the Affections of all Men. And he that will follow his own Humour, without caring whether he pleases or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleases Men, where he might innocently do it, is deservedly censur'd for a proud, arrogant and unmannerly Fellow.</note> We ought to have therefore a certain Respect and Reverence for all Men, and desire to be approv'd not only by the best, but by all
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64327:57"/>
the World: For not to care a farthing what 'tis Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think of One, is a sign not only of Pride and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedness, but indeed of having perfectly abandon'd all Modesty. <note n="h" place="bottom">Modesty, or the second sort of Decorum, consisting (as is said) in our due Carriage towards other Men; and Justice also in another manner doing the same: he here shews where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ, and what the distinct Duties of each.</note> But here we must observe, there's a great deal of difference between that which Justice, and that which this Modesty, Respect or Reverence demands, in relation to other People: 'Tis the Duty of Justice, not to injure or wrong any Man; of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or Reverence, not to do any thing that may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or displease him; wherein more especially the Nature of that Decorum we are speaking of consists. These things then being thus explain'd, I suppose it may clearly enough appear, what that is which we mean by <hi>Becoming.</hi> As for the Duties prescrib'd by it, the first thing to which it conducts us is, To demean our selves suitably and agreeably to our Nature, and do nothing that may any ways stain or deface it: for whilst we take <hi>this</hi> for our Guide and Conductress, <note n="i" place="bottom">For Virtue it self consists in acting agreeably to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> Reason: in following her therefore we shall but go in the Way of Virtue, and consequently can never be in the wrong.</note> 'tis impossible we should ever go out of the way; but by her shall be led thorough all the Paths of Wisdom, Truth and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; of Justice and Benificence toward the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mankind; and of true Magnanimity and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64327:57"/>
Greatness of Soul. But the Nature of Decency is more peculiarly seen in the fourth part of Honesty, concerning which we are now discoursing; and relates not only to the Motions of the Body, but more especially to those of the Mind also; each of which are approv'd and becoming, when they are such as are suitable to Nature. <note n="k" place="bottom">Since Decorum consists in acting suitably to Nature, and we must first know what Nature is, before we can tell what's suitable to it; therefore he here tells us wherein it consists.</note> Now the whole of the Nature or Mind of Man, is made up of only these two Parts: The <hi>first</hi> consists in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Appetite, which by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is call'd <gap reason="foreign">

from all Carelesness and Negligence on the other; nor should any thing be done, for which we can't give a sufficient <hi>Reason,</hi> which is almost the very Definition of Duty. In order to this <note n="a" place="bottom">Since God has endow'd us with the Faculty of Reason, to shew and instruct us in the Way of our Duty, What can be more either Sinful or Unbecoming, than to stifle the Sparks of it by Negligence and Heaviness? Or what more unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, than to make what should be our Guide and Directress, become a Captive and Slave to our irregular Passions? For God has given us that Divine Faculty to no purpose, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we refuse to be Guided and Conducted by it. The great and fundamental Duty therefore in this place, is, To do nothing but according to the Directions of Reason, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert her Soveraignty, and never suffer her to be captivated by any vicious Principle or inordinate Lust.</note> the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must be brought under the power of Reason, so as neither thro' Hastiness to run before its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor thro' Coldness and Heaviness to disregard 'em when given; but all their Motions must be so quieted and so restrain'd, as to bring no Uneasiness or Disturbance to the Mind. And from this calm and peaceable State of the Soul arises that Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Moderation we have mention'd: For when once the Passions grow unruly and extravagant, and refuse to be guided in their Desires and Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Rules of Prudence, <note n="b" place="bottom">For nothing is so wild and ungovernable as the Passions, when they've over-power'd and got the mastery of Reason.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64327:58"/>
in their Countenances, Voices, Gestures, and all their Actions; which sufficiently gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand (that we may return again to the Duty now before us) how necessary 'tis to restrain and give check to the Movements of the Appetite, and to be always Watchful and standing upon our Guard, that so we may neither be Careless and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate, nor do any thing Rashly and at all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. <note n="c" place="bottom">Since Reason (as was shewn) is the governing Part of Man, and he's bound to act according to its Precepts; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it must follow, That to spend his time in Idleness and Sloth, in foolish Playing and impertinent Jesting, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Duty, as being unworthy of that excellent Nature, which God has bestow'd on him. This brings him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, How far these things are allowable. As <hi>first,</hi> as to the <hi>Measure</hi> of Jesting, it must not be excessive: As to the <hi>Matter,</hi> it must not be immodest, or abusive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> For Mankind were never design'd by Nature, meerly to sport and idle away their Time; but to follow after grave and serious Studies, and Business of greater importance than Play is. Not but that Jesting and Diversion are allowable, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded we use 'em but only as Sleep, and other such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Refreshments of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our serious and more important Duties. And even then we must see, that our Jesting be neither excessive nor immodest, but such as is handsom and becoming a Gentleman. For as Boys are allow'd, not all kinds of Sports, but only such as have nothing that is vicious or ill in them; so in this Jesting we should allow our selves nothing, but only what is agreeable to Honesty and Good-manners. We may therefore observe, that Jesting or Merriment is of two sorts, the <hi>one</hi> clownish, abusive, scandalous and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64327:59"/>
obscene; the <hi>other</hi> handsom, gentile, ingenious and truly pleasant.

Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to live accordingly. This will shew us (as he goes on to observe) how mean and unworthy an Employment it is, for a Man to wallow in Lust and Sensuality; how inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his reasonable Nature; and how much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Goats and Swine.</note> constantly reflecting, <hi>How much Man's Nature excels that of Beasts and inferior Annimals.</hi> These have no tast or relish for any thing, but the Pleasures of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, towards which they are carry'd with a great deal of Eagerness: whereas nothing's more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and nourishing, as it were, to the Mind of Man, than Learning and Contemplation. Hence he is always a-seeking or contriving of something that's new, and is greatly delighted with seeing and hearing, for the increase of his Knowledge.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64327:60"/>

And does not the Consideration of the same Dignity and Excellence of our Natures, plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, how base and unworthy a thing it is, to dissolve in Luxury, Softness, and Effeminacy?

From what has
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64327:62"/>
been said it more fully appears, what that is which we call <note n="b" place="bottom">He means that which results from one's living up to his particular Character; not that general one, of which we have spoken before.</note> 
                  <hi>Becoming;</hi> since nothing can be such, that is done (as we say) in despite of Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the bent and tendency of a Man's Genius. Now it's certain if any thing in the World is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, 'tis a constant Uniformity in our whole Lives, and particular Actions; <note n="c" place="bottom">Because 'tis impossible wholly to conquer our Nature and Inclinations; so that tho' we should, by Custom to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, make shift to keep 'em under for some time, yet they'll certainly break out again, and so spoil that Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is requir'd in our Lives.</note> which 'tis utterly impossible we should ever maintain, so long as we run counter to our own Inclinations, and foolishly follow after those of other People: for as we should use our own Native Language, which all are suppos'd to understand best, and not <hi>lard</hi> our Talk (as a great many do) with Expressions out of <hi>Greek,</hi> who are therefore deservedly laugh'd at by others: So we should keep to one constant Tenour, and regular Conduct in our Lives and Actions; so that nothing may be in them, which is not well suited and of a piece with the rest. And this difference in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters or Natures of Men is of so great moment, as that in consequence of it, one Man may be oblig'd to make away with himself; whilst another, tho' like him as to all other Circumstances, may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to the contrary. <note n="d" place="bottom">He that was sirnam'd <hi>Uticensis,</hi> because he chose rather to kill himself at <hi>Utica,</hi> than yeild to the Power of <hi>Julius Caesar.</hi> He was Great Grandson to <hi>Censorius.

yet any of the rest might perhaps have been blam'd for't, had they murder'd themselves so as <hi>Cato</hi> did; because they were Men of less strictness in their Lives, and less severity in their Manners.

Each of these things should be thro'ly consider'd and revolv'd in our Minds, when e'er we deliberate about what will <hi>become</hi> us.

               <argument>
                  <p>Few so happy, as to consider thro'ly what Way of Life they should choose. The principal thing to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Choosing, is one's own Genius: Next to that one's Fortune in the World. After a Man has chose, he should stick to his Choice, without great Reasons to the contrary. How a Change should be made. Two Cautions to be observ'd about Imitating our Ancestors. Those Men whose Nature is not capable of some, should take the more care that they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues. The best Inheritance a Father can leave his Son, is the Fame of his Virtues. 'Tis a mighty Shame for a Son to be unworthy of the Fame of his Ancestors.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt those of all are the most difficult to be found, who having sufficient natural Parts, or suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Improvements of Learning and Education, or both these together, have withal had due time to consider with themselves, what's the best Course of Life they can follow in the World. <note n="a" place="bottom">Two things which ought to be carefully consider'd by us in Choosing our Calling: <hi>First,</hi> Our natural Disposition and Capacity for it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Fortune and outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the World.</note> Now in this Deliberation, the principal thing which we ought to regard, is each Man's peculiar Nature and Genius. For since the Decorum of each particular Action, as before was observ'd, is taken from the Disposition of the Person that does it; sure that Disposition should be carefully consulted, before we determine upon our whole Way of Living; <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See Note on ch.</hi> 31.</note> 'tis otherwise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible we should keep a due Tenour and Consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in our Lives, and not sometimes faulter in the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64327:66"/>
Performance of our Duty. But tho' Nature in this case has much the greater sway, yet Fortune comes in for a share next after her: both of 'em there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should be duly consulted in making choice of a Calling, but more especially Nature: For Fortune's unconstant and often changing, but Nature is firm, and will always abide by us; so that for the <hi>former</hi> to oppose this <hi>latter,</hi> is like a mortal Power's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with an immortal. <note n="c" place="bottom">After the Rules about choosing a Calling, he proceeds to shew, what a Man should do after he has chosen: <hi>Should not be eager to change,</hi> &amp;c.</note> That Man then, who has chose a Way of Living that's suitable to his <note n="d" place="bottom">His particular Nature or Genius.</note> Nature, (provided <hi>that</hi> Nature be no ways vitious) should make it his next care never to alter it; for nothing's less becoming than a Humour of Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if upon tryal he should find that he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in the choice of his Method, (as 'tis possible such a thing sometime may happen) there's no way left but to unravel again what is already done. If the Times themselves favour the making such a Change, it may be the more easily and convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done; but if not, it must be brought about gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually and insensibly: according to that Rule which is given by Wise Men, When e'er you design to break off any Friendship or displeasing Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, you should loosen the Knot by little and little, and not try to cut it asunder all at once. And when by this means we have chang'd our course of Life, great care should be taken that we may seem to have done it upon very good Reasons. But having before recommended the Imitation of our Fathers and Ancestors, I must here interpose an Exception or two: In the first place then, we should take great care, not to follow 'em in any
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64327:67"/>
thing that is vitious or blamable. Nor, secondly, should we attempt it, when we find our Constitution wont carry us thro' with it: Thus, for instance, the Son of the former <hi>Africanus,</hi> (who adopted this <hi>latter</hi> being Son to <hi>Paullus)</hi> by reason of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and indisposition of his Body, could not so well tread in the steps of his Father, as his Father had done in those of his <note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> a famous and valiant <hi>Roman,</hi> who, together with his Brother, bravely defended <hi>Spain,</hi> while <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in <hi>Italy,</hi> routing the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in several Battles. At last they were both Slain, and young <hi>Scipio,</hi> who was afterward first sirnam'd <hi>Africanus,</hi> succeeded 'em.</note> Grandfather. But then if a Man be in such a condition, as that he's unable to plead at the Bar, to harangue the People, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct an Army; <note n="f" place="bottom">Those who, for any of the fore-mentioned Reasons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish the Publick, must not think 'emselves immediately excus'd from serving it in their proportion, and in the way they are able. The most solitary Life should do some Good, and Retirement should not minister to Luxury or Idleness, but to Virtue and Sobriety. Those that can't shew their Valour, Eloquence or Policy for the Publick, may however their Modesty, Liberality, Fidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Retirement.</note> he should take the more care that he do those things, which <hi>are</hi> in his Power; such are the Duties of Justice and Fidelity, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, Temperance and Liberality; the performance of which may serve to make amends for his want of the others. Now the noblest Inheritance that can be left by a Father to his Son, and far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that</hi> of Houses and Lands, is the Fame of his Virtues and glorious Actions: and for a Son to live fo as is unworthy of the Name and Reputation of his Ancestors, is the basest and most abominable thing in the World.</p>

                  <p>The respective Duties belonging to each Age. Old Men should have an Eye upon Youth. Vice is doubly Evil in Old Men, because of the ill Example given to the Young.

               </argument>
               <p>ANd since each Age has its respective Duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, and the same things become not both Young and Old, <note n="a" place="bottom">Another sort of Decorum consists in Acting agreeably to one's Age; in Youth's doing what is proper for Youth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> I must add something also upon this Distinction: 'Tis required then of the younger sort of People, that they pay due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to those that are Old, and choose out the best and most approved among 'em, by whose Counsel and Direction they may steer their Lives. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Unskilfulness and Ignorance of Youth, does stand in some need of the Prudence of Old Age, to be its Guide and Director. This Age especially should be kept from all loose and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Living, and be enur'd to Labour, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Hardships both of Body and Mind: that so they may be able to bear with the Toils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of Business, whether in Peace or War. And if they do at any time slacken their Minds, and give 'emselves up to their Pleasures and Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, great care should be taken that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not the Limits of Temperance and Modesty: And in order to this, 'twould be very convenient, if some aged People would keep a constant Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Sports and Recreations. <note n="b" place="bottom">So much for the Duties of Youth; he proceeds now to those of Old Men.</note> As for old
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64327:68"/>
Men, 'tis their Duty to lessen the Labours of the Body, and employ more frequently those of the Mind; and make it their Business, by prudent and wise Counsels, to do what Good they can to the younger sort of People, to their Friends and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and more especially to the Republick. And Old Men of all things should especially be careful, not to languish out their Days in unprofitable Idleness. Luxury and Riot is unbecoming in all, but is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly scandalous and intolerable in Old Age: but should Lust and Wantonness come into the bargain, those who are guilty of it are doubly faulty; For, first, they bring a Shame and Disgrace upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and withal make the young Men more shamelesly Wicked.

If you would have a true Comliness, you must endeavour to keep a good
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64327:71"/>
Colour in your Face, and the way to do that, is to use frequent Exercise. Nor do we forbid Men the use of all Ornaments and Graces to recommend 'em, but only of those that are too exquisite and affected: so far they are allowable, as they are necessary to keep a Man from being thought a Clown, and from shewing a Disrespect for the Persons he has to do with. And the same Rule may serve very well for our Cloaths; in which to be moderate, as in most other cases, is certainly the best way. We should also avoid an effeminate softness and slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in our Gate, like those that are marching along in Procession; and no less an over-great hastiness and speed, which only begets a deep panting and breathing, distorts the Face, and perfectly changes the whole Air of the Countenance, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a lightness and inconstancy of Humour. Now if the Motions of the Body deserve all this Pains and Concern about 'em; how much Care should we take <note n="b" place="bottom">If this ben't done, the Motions of the Body, however gentile and graceful they may be, will but make our Folly the more remarkable; and such sort of Men are well enough compar'd by one, to an ill Piece of Painting, set off and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with a beautiful Frame.

Now the Motions of the Soul are of two sorts, some of 'em proceeding from the Reasonable or Thinking, others from the Sensitive and Passionate part: The former is busied in nothing but searching and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Each of these things should be diligently taken care of, if we desire to Act decently on all Occasions. Our <note n="c" place="bottom">Having done with what concerns the manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, and Regulation of the Voice; and advis'd against Affectation, Loudness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Speaking: He now proceeds to give some Rules about our Discourse, as that it should be Easie, not Tedious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which relate, some of 'em to the <hi>Manner,</hi> others to the <hi>Matter,</hi> and others to the <hi>Measure</hi> that should be observ'd in Talking; and all deserve to be carefully consider'd.</note> common Discourse then I'd have to be such, as that wherein the Followers of <hi>Socrates</hi> excel; easie and good-natur'd, without any stubbornness or stiffness in Opinion: Let it be season'd with mirth and pleasantness; and not be too tedious, pert, and assuming, as tho' it had a Right to the Attention of the Hearers, and no body else had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to do with it: but think it reasonable, as in all other cases, so in this of Discourse, to let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man fairly take his own turn. But especially in the first place it ought to be consider'd, what is the Nature of the Subject we are discoursing upon: if it be <hi>serious,</hi> we should handle it with serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but if it be <hi>merry,</hi> with gaiety and briskness. But the most important thing to be taken care of, is, That our Talk don't discover any Viciousness in our Manners; which is apt to appear by nothing so much, as by falling too foul upon those that are absent, either by turning 'em into Ridicule, or misrepresenting 'em by malicious, reproachful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.

               </argument>
               <p>'TIs a general Rule for the Conduct of our Lives, That we make it our Business to be free from Passion; that is, from all violent Motions of the Soul, which reject and cast off their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Reason. This should be apply'd to the Matter now before us, and all our Discourse should be Calm and Unpassionate, without any Transports of Anger or Desire; as also on the other hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deadness, and Heaviness, or any such Vice: And in every Company we should carefully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to shew a sort of Kindness and Respect for those Persons, with whom we converse.

comes to pass, that <note n="a" place="bottom">He has done with those Rules, which concern the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our <hi>Discourse in general:</hi> He now proceeds to some <hi>particular</hi> Species of it.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Chiding</hi> is necessary; in which we may be allow'd a little to raise our Voices, and to use more Sharpness and Authority in our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: However we must be careful that we do not discover any Passion; but let it rather be seen that we come to such Corrections, as Physitians do to cutting and scarifying Wounds, but seldom, and with a great deal of Regret and Unwillingness. And indeed we should never come to 'em at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be necessary, and when no other Methods will do any good. And even then, when we're forc'd to't, we must be sure (as was said) to avoid all Anger; for whatsoever is guided by its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Directions, can never be done with any Prudence or Moderation. Our Rebukes should be generally mild and gentle; but nevertheless such, as may carry some Weight and Authority along with 'em; observing a Mean betwixt too great Easiness, and breaking out into angry and contumelious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And whatsoever Sharpness we may express in our Reproofs, we should let the Person so correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed know, that we do it altogether for his Good, and not for any Ends or Self-designs. <note n="b" place="bottom">Another <hi>particular sort of Discourse,</hi> is that which falls out in Quarrels betwixt Opposers; in which 'tis our Duty to be calm and sedate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Gravity, nor be approv'd of by those who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Company.

For what is more Unseemly, and contrary to good Manners, than when we're engag'd about serious Business, to bring in some pleasant and merry Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that's proper for a Feast or over a Glass of Wine? 'Twas a very good Answer to the present Purpose, which <hi>Pericles</hi> once gave to <note n="c" place="bottom">A famous Tragedian of <hi>Athens,</hi> whose Works are still extant, and counted the most perfect in their kind. His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Poet did not hinder him from being a good Soldier and a wise Statesman.

                  <hi>Sophocles</hi> the Tragedian: They were both of 'em Praetors of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> together, and meeting one Day about some Business of their Office, it happen'd a beautiful Boy pass'd by; whom <hi>Sophocles</hi> espying, <hi>Heavens!</hi> said he, Pericles, <hi>What a delicate Youth is there!</hi> To

                  <note n="d" place="bottom">The Word <hi>Abstinentes</hi> refers to both <hi>Manus</hi> and <hi>Oculi:</hi> in the former Case it signifies <hi>Uncorrupted,</hi> or free from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and receiving Gifts; in the latter <hi>Chast,</hi> or free from all wanton and lascivious Looks. A Magistrate ought to have both.</note> 
                  <hi>keep a strict Guard, not over his Hands only, but his Eyes too.</hi> Now had <hi>Sophocles</hi> happen'd to say the same Words, at a time when they were choosing of Wrestlers or Racers, such a Rebuke had been wholly undeserved: So much may the Merit, or Demerit of an Action, depend upon the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Time and Place. Suppose, for Example, a Man had some considerable Cause upon his Hands, or Business that requir'd attentive Thinking: Could any one blame him for being very thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as he walk'd or rid? But should he shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so at a Feast among Company, it would be counted a great piece of Rudeness and Ill-breeding, and this for not observing the Difference of Seasons. Now as for those things, which notoriously offend against the Rules of Good Manners, such as for a Man to Sing openly in the Streets, or any other gross and apparent Absurdity, these are so easie to be observ'd by all, that we need give no Rules or Directions about 'em; but we ought more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to employ our Care, in avoiding those little unheeded Indecencies, which are hardly understood by the generality of Mankind. And as the least fault or disagreement in the Notes, is immediately perceiv'd by a skilful Musician; so we should take all imaginable Care, that there be no Disagreement in our Lives and Actions: and that so much the more, as the Harmony in our Lives is of much greater Consequence, than that in our Musick.</p>

               <p>AS therefore the delicate Ear of the Artist can quickly discover the least fault in his Musick; so would we take as much care in detecting and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring our Vices, we might from the least and most trivial Matters, make several Observations that would be much to our advantage. From the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our Eyes, for Example; from our way of smoothing or wrinkling our Brows; from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or sorrowful Air of our Countenances; from our Laughter, freedom or reservedness in Discourse; from the raising or falling the Tone of our Voices, and a great many other such little kind of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we might easily judge what is Handsom and Becoming us, and what is repugnant to the Rules of our Duty, and to that which our Nature or Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er requires. Now in this Particular 'tis a very good way, To observe first in others how each of these suits, that so we may avoid and correct in <hi>our selves,</hi> whatever we see bad and misbecoming in <hi>them.</hi> For, I know not how, we can sooner 'spy Faults out in other People, than we can in our selves; upon which account there's no better way to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect any Learner, than for the Master to mimick his Faults before him; that so he, perceiving their Deformity in another, may the sooner be brought
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64327:78"/>
to amend 'em in himself. Another good way is, Whenever we are in doubt and suspence about a Duty, to go to some learned or experienc'd Person, and ask his Advice upon the Matter in question, before we resolve and determin with our selves: Because, generally speaking, when left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Men are apt to be guided too much by their own Inclinations and Natures. And in asking this Advice we should diligently observe, <note n="a" place="bottom">For Ill-will, private Interest, and a thousand the like things, may make People give us Advice, which they don't think best: or blind 'em and make 'em think that best, which really is not so.</note> not only what every one tells us in Words, but what his real inward Opinion is, and what Reasons and Grounds he may have for such Opinions. For <hi>as</hi> your Statuaries, Painters and Poets, use to set their Works out to be publickly view'd; that so they may be able to correct such Faults, as are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally found by Spectators in 'em: and <hi>as</hi> they consider with themselves and their Friends, what Oversights or Mistakes they have been guilty of in 'em; <hi>so</hi> should we make use of other People's Judgments as well as our own, and do or not do, correct or alter a great many things upon their Advice. As for those things that are settled by Custom and Civil Constitutions, I shall give no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections at all concerning 'em; for they are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Directions of themselves: I shall only observe, That 'tis a great Mistake in any one to think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such Men as <note n="b" place="bottom">Several eminent Philosophers have been of that Name. One Schollar of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and Founder of the <hi>Cyrenaick</hi> Sect: another his Grandson. 'Tis uncertain which he means here.</note> 
                  <hi>Aristippus,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> have ventur'd to say, or do a great many things, which are contrary to Rule and receiv'd Custom, that therefore he may be allow'd the same: For these
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64327:78"/>
are Persons of extraordinary Merits, and almost more than Human Perfections; and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count might demand some Privileges, which aren't to be granted to the rest of the World. But as for the Practice and manner of the <hi>Cynicks,</hi> 'tis wholly to be discarded; for 'tis a plain Offence against the Rules of Modesty, without which nothing can be Virtuous and Becoming. 'Tis our Duty to pay a Respect and Deference, as to all those that are Virtuous and Couragious, who design for the Good and Advantage of the Republick, and serve or have serv'd her in any of her Interests; so to those also, who bear any Office or Command in the State. We should pay in like manner a peculiar Regard and Reverence to old Age: never resist any publick Magistrate: make a Distinction between Citizens and Strangers; and of Strangers 'emselves, between those in a private and publick Capacity.

the Duties of <hi>Justice,</hi> or preserving the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and those of <hi>Prudence,</hi> or the Knowledge of Truth, should come into Competition one with another; the former, I think, should take place of the latter, as being more Consonant to the Dictates of Nature, which may easily be prov'd by this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Argument: Suppose a Wise Man to be in such a place, as afforded him all the Conveniencies of Life, and all the Opportunities of Leisure in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, so that he might Study and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate every thing, that was any ways worthy his Knowledge or Contemplation; <hi>yet</hi> were he wholly depriv'd of all Company, and had no body ever come near him to be seen, he'd quickly be tired and grow weary of his Life.

that Learning, and those Instructions I receiv'd from my Masters. Neither is their Teaching, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing others, determin'd to the time of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving here; but they continue to do it even after they are dead, by the learned Discourses which they leave behind them: For there's no one Point they have left unhandled, relating either to the Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, or Discipline of the Commonwealth: So that they seem to have sacrific'd their leisure and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of Study, to the Benefit of those who are engag'd in Business. And thus we see how those Men themselves, whose Lives have been spent in the pursuit of Wisdom, have nevertheless endeavour'd by their Learning and Prudence, to be some way profitable to the Community of Mankind. And for this one Reason, perswasive Speaking, if joyn'd with Prudence, is a greater Accomplishment than the acutest Thinking, if destitute of Eloquence: for <hi>Thinking</hi> is terminated in it self alone, but Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaches out to the Benefit of those, with whom we are joyn'd in the same Society. Now as Bees don't <hi>therefore</hi> unite themselves together, that so they may the better prepare their Combs; but <hi>therefore</hi> prepare their Combs, because they do by Nature unite themselves together: So Men, and much more, being Creatures that naturally love So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; in consequence of that, seek how they may find Methods of living happily in it. From hence it follows, That the Knowledge of things, unless 'tis accompany'd with that sort of Virtue, which consists in defending and preserving of Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Maintenance of Human Society, is but a barren and fruitless Accomplishment; and even <hi>Greatness of Soul,</hi> without a regard to this Society and Conjunction, is very little better than Savage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Barbarity. Thus we may see, that the getting of Knowledge is a Duty of much less Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64327:82"/>
and Moment, than the preserving this Society and Union amongst Men. 'Tis a very false Notion that hath been advanc'd by some People, <hi>That</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity alone was the Motive to this Society, which we have so often mention'd; and <hi>that</hi> Men would never have associated together, but that they weren't able, in a solitary Life, to furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Necessaries of Nature; and <hi>that</hi> every great and exalted Genius, would Providence supply him with Food and the other Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of Life, would withdraw from all Business and Entercourse with Men, and give himself wholly to Study and Contemplation. This is not so; for he would avoid Solitude, endeavour to find a Companion in his Studies, and always be desirous of Teaching and Learning, of Hearing and Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. From all which things 'tis abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That the Duties belonging to Human Society, should in reason take place before those which relate to <hi>unactive</hi> Knowledge.</p>

I had spent a good part of my time in these, whilst I was young, for the improvement of my Reason: But when I came once to be a Candidate for Places, and devoted my self to the Service of the Publick; I had little time left for Philosophical Enquiries; only so much, as could be spar'd from the Business of my Friends and the State; which was wholly taken up in nothing but Reading, without any Leisure at all for Writing.</p>

               <p>HOwever then we have this Advantage, in the midst of all our Miseries and Calamities, that by them we are brought to the Writing of those things, <note n="a" place="bottom">The <hi>Romans</hi> receiv'd their Philosophy from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and did not begin to cultivate it to any purpose, till <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time.</note> which were not sufficiently known amongst us, tho' nothing in the World more deserves our Knowledge.

To this Industry of Men we are also indebted for Conveyances of Water, for making new Channels and Arms to Rivers, and for turning the Streams after such a manner, as thereby to water and fatten our Grounds; for throwing up Banks to defend us from the Waves, and making of new Harbors in convenient Places.

This then being indisputably true, That the <hi>Goods</hi> Men enjoy, and the <hi>Evils</hi> they suffer, proceed for the most part from Men themselves; I say 'tis the principal Office of Virtue, to procure the Good-liking and Favour of Men, and so to engage their Endeavours and Affections, as to make 'em still ready to do us any Kindness. 'Tis the Business therefore of laborious Callings, to supply us with all the Conveniencies of Life, which may be had from the Use of inanimate Beings, and unreasonable Animals: But to gain the Affections of <hi>Men</hi> on our side, and beget in <hi>them</hi> always a readiness and desire to advance our Interest, is a Work that requires the Wisdom and Virtue of the greatest Men. <note n="d" place="bottom">He proves what he just now said, <hi>That it requires Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c. For, <hi>says he,</hi> the whole Work and Exercise of Virtue consists in one of these three things: 1. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Reason and Understanding; which is the Work of Prudence, and the intellectual Virtues. 2. To go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and restrain the Passions, and keep the sensual Appetite in subjection to Reason; which Temperance and the Moral Virtues do. 3. To gain the Affections of Men, so as to make 'em promote our Interest; which any of the former may help to do. Thus Wisdom or Knowledge, for Instance, perfect the Understanding, and are proper to beget in Men Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Reliance on us. <hi>[See chap.</hi> 9.] So Justice, and Greatness of Soul, moderate the Passions and Inclinations; and also make Men love, respect, and honour us. <hi>See chap.</hi> 9, 10, 11, &amp;c.</note> For the whole Work and Exercise of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in general, consists in some one of these three things: The <hi>first</hi> is a Knowledge, in all we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, of what is agreeable to Truth and Sincerity; what's becoming and suitable to every one's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; what will be the Consequence of such or

such Actions; what are the Materials out of which things are made, and what the Causes that first brought 'em into Being. The <hi>second,</hi> A restraining the violent Motions and Passions of the Soul, which by the <hi>Grecians</hi> are termed <gap reason="foreign">

               </argument>
               <p>WHat <note n="a" place="bottom">Men doing us the most Good and most Evil, (as is shewn) it follows that those are the profitablest Actions, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Men to be of our side, and to do all the Good they can, and keep from us all the Evil: What these are he proceeds now to shew; only observing one thing by the way.</note> Means should be us'd for the gaining, and securing Men firm to our Interests, we shall mention immediately; but we have one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation to make before-hand. <note n="b" place="bottom">It might have been objected, That the good or ill Success of our Actions depends upon Fortune, and not Men's Assistance; which therefore why should we endeavour to procure?

and Authority. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Hope, when they expect to get something from him; as when Princes or popular Men promise great Donations. And, <hi>last of all,</hi> Hire, when they are drawn to't by Money or Presents; which is much the most pitiful and sordid Way, as for those on the one hand that are taken by it, so likewise for those that endeavour to make use of it: For 'tis never well when People shall attempt to get that by Money, which ought to be the Reward of Virtue and Merit. However seeing sometimes one must have recourse to this Method as a Refuge, I shall give some Rules for our Direction in the Use of it; but first speak of those, that are more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to Virtue and Honesty. <note n="f" place="bottom">He brings in this, because he designs to Discourse not only about <hi>private</hi> Persons, How <hi>they</hi> should get others to be serviceable to 'em; but of <hi>Governours</hi> also of a State or Commonwealth, How <hi>they</hi> should do to make their Subjects and Allies be firm to their Interests.</note> In much the same manner, and for several such Reasons, Men submit to the Power and Authority of another: Either because they have a <hi>Kindness</hi> for him; or have formerly receiv'd some Obligations from him; or <hi>respect</hi> him for his Worth; or <hi>hope</hi> they shall get something by it; or <hi>fear</hi> they shall be forc'd to it, if they don't do it voluntarily; or are drawn by fair <hi>Promises</hi> and large Donations; or, lastly, (as we see it too often practis'd in our own Republick) are downright <hi>hired</hi> to it.</p>

For tho' a Man should by his Power and Greatness oppress the Laws, and over-awe Liberty by Terrour and Threatnings, yet still they will find time to recover again, first by the private Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Citizens, and afterwards by their choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in secret Consults, some worthier Person to free 'em from the Oppressour. And Liberty, after she has been chain'd up a while, is always more Curst, and bites deeper, than she would otherwise have done if she had never been restrain'd. Let us therefore embrace and adhere to that Method, which is of the most universal Influence, and serves not only to secure us what we have, but moreover to enlarge our Power and Authority: That is in short, Let us rather endeavour to be <hi>Lov'd</hi> than <hi>Fear'd;</hi> which is certainly the best way to make us successful as well in our private, as our publick Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.

                     <hi>The just and gentle Government of the old</hi> Romans: <hi>When chang'd, and the fatal Consequences of that Change.</hi> Caesar <hi>and</hi> Sylla<hi>'s unjust Cruelties. One Cause of Civil Wars is Mens hoping to raise 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by them. All have occasion for some Friends, tho' not for general Love.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Much rather choose, upon such a Subject, to bring Instances from Forreign, than our own Nation. However, I can't but observe thus much, That so long as our Empire supported it self, not by Ways of Injustice and Violence, but rather by Actions of Kindness and Gentleness; Wars were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to Protect its Allies or Defend its Honour, and accordingly their Issues were attended with Mercy, or at least no more Rigour than was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary. The Senate then was a kind of Port or Refuge, for Princes and Nations to have recouse to in their need; and our Officers and Commanders made it their greatest Glory, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Provinces, and Assist their Allies, with Justice and Fidelity. This City therefore was not then the <note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Patrocinium verius quam imperium.</hi> 'Twas the Duty of a Patron to Protect and Defend, not to Rule over his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: and one was never the less free, because he was under the Patronage of another, but only the more safe, as being protected by him. In like manner one Nation might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and (as 'twere) the Client of another, and yet be a Free Nation for all that. Whence there's a difference in <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, betwixt <hi>in fide esse,</hi> and <hi>in ditione esse pop. Roman.</hi> The latter denoting a loss of Liberty; the former only some sort of Inferiority and Homage.</note> 
                  <hi>Empress,</hi> so properly as the <hi>Protectress</hi> of all the World. This Conduct and Method of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the State, began by little and little to <hi>wear off</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:64327:95"/>
before, but utterly <hi>vanish'd</hi> immediately after the Victory of <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luc. Sylla</hi> the Dictator. He took up Arms against <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and defended the Cause of the Nobility against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in a bloody Civil War: but after his Victory was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly Cruel. <hi>See his Life at large in</hi> Plut.</note> 
                  <hi>Sylla;</hi> for People began to think nothing could be unjust to their Confederates and Allies, when once they had seen so great Cruelties exercis'd even upon their very Citizens. This Man therefore was in a just Cause, but which was follow'd by a cruel and most unjust Victory: he having had the Boldness and Impudence to say, when in full Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket he was selling the Goods of some honest and wealthy Men, and whom he himself knew to be <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, <hi>That he was going to make sale of his own Booty.</hi> But there has come <note n="c" place="bottom">He means <hi>Julius Caesar.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>one</hi> after him, whose Cause was impious, and his Victory yet more scandalous and inhuman: who did not stop at selling of private Mens Estates, but involv'd all our Countries and Provinces together in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamity. Hence we have seen, after Havock and Devastation made in other Countries, as it were by way of Praelude to the Loss of our own Empire, the City <note n="d" place="bottom">A City in <hi>France,</hi> which had always taken part with the <hi>Romans,</hi> in all their Wars on that side. But declaring for <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Civil War, 'twas sack'd by <hi>Caesar;</hi> who carry'd along a Figure of it (as was their usual Custom) with him in Triumph.</note> 
                  <hi>Marseilles</hi> drawn along in Triumph; and that very place, without whose Assistance our former Generals never brought Triumph from beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> has now found one that could have so much Impudence, as to Triumph over its own Destruction. I might bring a great many other Examples, of most impious Treatment that hath been shewn towards our Allies; but this single Instance is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sufficient, being one of the basest that was ever
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64327:96"/>
committed before the face of the Sun. The truth on't is we have deserv'd these Misfortunes; for if <hi>others</hi> had not 'scap'd without Punishment for their Wickedness, <hi>this Man</hi> could never have arriv'd at that Insolence; who tho' he has left but few Heirs of his Estate, I am afraid will have a great many wicked ones of his Ambition. For as long as some dissolute and profligate Fellows remember that <note n="e" place="bottom">When <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> sold the Goods of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, whom he had Out-law'd, and caus'd to be Slain.</note> former inhuman Auction, and are in hopes one day of seeing the same again, they'll always be for propagating Civil Dissentions. Thus <hi>Publius Sylla,</hi> who was so busie in <hi>that</hi> mention'd, when his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was Dictator, was never contented till he had manag'd <note n="f" place="bottom">When <hi>Caesar</hi> sold the Goods of those, who had been of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party.</note> a worse and more inhuman Auction six and thirty Years after: and <note n="g" place="bottom">One <hi>Cornelius,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Salust</hi> in <hi>Lepidus</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul's Speech against <hi>Sylla.</hi>
                  </note> another, who was <hi>Scribe</hi> in that former Dictatorship, in this latter was advanc'd to be <hi>Treasurer</hi> of the City. By all which 'tis easie enough to perceive, that we are never to hope we shall be free from Civil Wars, when People expect to make their Fortunes by 'em. We have therefore only the Walls of our City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining entire, and even <hi>they,</hi> as 'twere, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to feel the Effects of their abominable Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but as for the Republick 'tis absolutely sunk into Ruins and Nothing. And all these Misfortunes have fall'n upon us (that I may return to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which occasion'd this Digression) by our choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to Govern rather by <hi>Fear</hi> than <hi>Love.</hi> What then ought particular Persons to expect, when Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppression could bring all these Evils upon the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire? <note n="h" place="bottom">Having shewn how convenient <hi>Love,</hi> and how inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient <hi>Fear</hi> is, for the advancement of our Interest; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that he should shew how the former may be obtain'd. To it he joyns <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Confidence;</hi> the second and third Means mention'd Chap. 6. which three together make up true and perfect <hi>Glory. See the next Chapter.</hi>
                  </note> This then being
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64327:96"/>
so manifestly plain, That <hi>Love</hi>'s a most powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Obedience, but <hi>Fear</hi> a most weak and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous one; it follows in the next place that we should discourse of those Means, whereby such a <hi>Love,</hi> joyn'd with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> may most easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gotten. <note n="i" place="bottom">Before he enquires how this <hi>Love</hi> is to be gotten, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it (if I may so say) into <hi>Love of Friendship,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in having some few good Friends; and this he says all, whether great or mean, are almost equally concern'd to get; and <hi>general Love,</hi> which consists in the Kindness and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good-will of all the Citizens; and this is necessary but to some few. Of the former he has spoken in his <hi>Laelius</hi> or <hi>of Friendship;</hi> and therefore passes it by here. The latter he gives some Rules about here, as making up, together with <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Admiration,</hi> true and perfect Glory.</note> Now this is what all Men don't equally stand in need of; but each should consider his own way of living, and accordingly judge what's convenientest for him; whether to be <hi>belov'd</hi> by the generality of Men, or only by some few and select Persons. This however we may lay down for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as a first and most necessary Rule in this case, to procure at least <hi>some</hi> faithful and sincere Friends, who may have a true Kindness and Esteem for us. <note n="k" place="bottom">That is, Tho' all don't stand in need of the general Love and Good-will of the Citizens, yet particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friends are as useful to the Meanest, as to the Great and more Powerful.</note> As far as this reaches, there's very little difference between even the greatest and meanest of People, and all sorts of 'em are almost equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to endeavour after it. As for Honour, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the general Good-will of <hi>all</hi> the Citizens, these indeed are things, which aren't alike useful and necessary for all. However for those that have
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64327:97"/>
been able to get 'em, they are very good Helps, as for most other Purposes, so for the obtaining of faithful Friends: But of Friendship I have treated in another Work, which is entitled <hi>Laelius.</hi>

                  <p>What the Ingredients of true Glory are. By what Means the Love of the People may be obtain'd. How Men may be brought to place a Confidence in us. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice more powerful than Cunning to this End.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEt us now proceed to discourse of <hi>Glory;</hi> tho' <hi>that</hi> too is a Subject, upon which I have <note n="a" place="bottom">They are both lost. He mentions them two or three times in his Epistles to <hi>Atticus.</hi>
                  </note> two Books already extant; however I shall touch upon it here in short, because 'tis a thing of such Weight and Moment toward the successful Management of the most important Affairs. True and perfect Glory then is always made up of these three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients: <hi>First,</hi> The Love and Good-will of the Multitude. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their Trusting and Reliance upon a Man. And, <hi>Lastly,</hi> Their Valuing and Admiring him so, as to think him a Person that really deserves Honour. The Means of getting these three from the Multitude, (to give one short and easie Rule) are very much the same as from particular Persons. However there's another pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Way of approaching the People, and gaining Admittance into the Hearts and Affections of all Men in general. <note n="b" place="bottom">He Discourses in order of the Ways how to obtain these three, and first <hi>Love:</hi> the Means of gaining which are Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, a generous Disposition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Of those three then, which I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64327:97"/>
just now mention'd, let us first see the Ways of obtaining <hi>Love.</hi> Now the Love of the People is mov'd by nothing so much, as by Bounty and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kindnesses: Next they are pleas'd with an hearty Desire and Inclination toward it, tho' a Man have not wherewithal to exercise it. Thirdly, The very Name and Reputation of having Beneficence and Liberality, Justice and Fidelity, with the rest of those Virtues, which give a kind of Smoothness and Agreeableness to our Conversation, is of very great Efficacy in getting us the Favour and Love of the Multitude: and the reason of it is, because Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and <hi>Decorum</hi> delight us of themselves, and by their own native Beauties and Excellencies move, and engage the Hearts of all Men: which seeing they appear with more Lustre in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which I just now mention'd; it follows that by Nature we must Love those People, in whom we suppose such Virtues to reside. And these are the principal Causes of Men's Loving us: there might, I confess, be some others given, but not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Weight and Importance with these. <note n="c" place="bottom">Secondly, How Men are brought to <hi>confide</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> in us, which is the second part of true Glory. The two great Means are <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> or Knowledge of Business: of these Justice is the chief.</note> We are to speak in the next place of their <hi>Trusting</hi> or <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in us; for the compassing of which, 'tis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we should be suppos'd to have two Qualifications, <hi>viz. Prudence</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">How <hi>Prudence</hi> makes Men confide in us.</note> For we trust those Men, whom we believe, <hi>to</hi> understand Matters better than we do; <hi>to be</hi> wise enough to see things before they are arriv'd, and in the Management of 'em, if any Danger should happen, <hi>to be</hi> ready at finding out Ways and Expedients, to disentangle 'emselves from the Perplexities of it: in which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64327:98"/>
Men imagin that all true and profitable Wisdom consists. <note n="e" place="bottom">How <hi>Justice</hi> makes Men confide in us.</note> But when a Man is found really <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Faithful,</hi> that is <hi>Good,</hi> we place so much Trust and Confidence in such a one, as not to entertain any the least suspicion of Deceit or Injury. To such a Man therefore we think we may wisely, and with a secure Confidence, entrust our Safeties, our Children and our Fortunes. Justice therefore, of these two Virtues, has much the more strong and effectual Tendency, to procure this Credit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence from the People. For <hi>that,</hi> even without Wisdom, can go a great way toward the obtaining of this End; whereas Wisdom, without <hi>that,</hi> is unable to do any thing: For the more Shrew'd and Cunning any Person is, the more he's Suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Hated by the World, if he ben't counted Honest and Upright withal. Justice therefore, in conjunction with Wisdom, can make a Man be trusted as far as he pleases: Justice without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can do a great deal; but the other without <hi>that</hi> is of no Force at all.</p>

This Objection, with his Answer to it, occasions this short Digression. <hi>See Note <hi rend="sup">c</hi> on chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Book</hi> 1.</note> SOme Men perhaps will be ready to admire, since 'tis so generally agreed on by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and has been so often asserted by me my self, That whoever has <hi>one</hi> must have <hi>all</hi> the Virtues; why I should speak of 'em separately now, as tho' it were possible for a Man to have Prudence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having Justice at the same time. I answer, That the Way of Expression is highly different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference of the Subjects we are treating of; whether they are such as require a Niceness and Subtilty in handling, or be suited to the Capacities of ordinary People. I do but speak here with the Vulgar therefore, when I call one Man <hi>Couragious,</hi> another <hi>Just,</hi> and a third <hi>Prudent;</hi> for in treating upon a Subject which concerns the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we must make use of common and ordinary Expressions; which is what has been done by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naetius</hi> himself—. But to return to our Purpose: <note n="b" place="bottom">He has shewn how the two first Ingredients of true Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> of the Multitude, are to be obtain'd: here he proceeds to the third, <hi>Their Admiring,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Of the three Ingredients, which we said were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64327:99"/>
to the making up of Glory; the third was this, That Men should Admire and Value us so, as to think we are Persons that really deserve Honour. <note n="c" place="bottom">The Extraordinariness of any thing, the first Cause of Mens Admiration.</note> Now generally speaking they are apt to <hi>Admire</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they see Great, and beyond their Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and likewise in particulars, if they discover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Excellency, which they never expected. They Admire those therefore, and extol 'em ev'n to the Skies, in whom (as they think) they have found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rare and extraodinary Qualities: But as for those others, who have neither Virtue, Spirit, nor Courage in them, these Men they wholly despise and set light by. For they can't be said to <hi>despise</hi> all those, of whom they entertain but <hi>an Ill Opinion.</hi> They're <hi>far from thinking well</hi> of your roguish backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, cozening sort of Fellows, who are never unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the doing Man an Injury: but by no means <note n="d" place="bottom">But rather are afraid of 'em, lest they should do 'em some Injury, or other.</note> 
                  <hi>despise</hi> 'em for all that; their Contempt (as was said) lighting only upon those, who neither do Good to themselves, nor others (as we commonly speak;) that is, who spend all their Lives in meer Idleness and Sloth, without ever minding or taking care of any thing. <note n="e" place="bottom">A more particular Cause of Admiration, is extraordinary Virtue: especially resisting <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> which most Men are apt to be conquer'd by: which is Courage or Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Soul.</note> Those, who are esteem'd to excel in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, more especially draw Men to Wonder and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; who keep themselves free, as from all other things that are Base and Unbecoming, so more especially from those sorts of Vices, which the rest of Mankind can't so easily stand against. <hi>Pleasures,</hi> for instance, are very alluring. and charming Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, which are apt to ensnare the better part of

the Soul, and entice it aside from the Paths of Virtue; and <hi>Pain</hi> on the contrary racks and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments us, so that the dread of it carries most Men beyond the Bounds of Reason. Thus again, when <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death, Riches</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> are the things in question, there are very few Men but are wholly transported with <hi>desire</hi> of the one, and <hi>abhorrence</hi> of the other. When a Man therefore has got such a great and exalted Soul, as that he can look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all these with Indifference; and closely pursues and adheres to Honesty, in whatever Shape she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents her self; then 'tis that Virtue appears with such a Brightness, as that all the whole World must admire her Beauties.</p>

                  <p>Justice, and a Contempt of Riches, are especially Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Mens Admiration. Justice alone procures all the three things, which make up Glory; and how.

                  </note> those things, which are contrary to these, before the great Duties of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Honesty.

'Tis very plain therefore, that those Men were usually chosen to be Kings, who were count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the People Men of Honesty and Integrity: but if they were held Prudent and Wise withal, the People thought there was nothing they might not obtain by their Conduct and Management.

               </argument>
               <p>'TIs the Business therefore of those, who desire to get true Glory, strictly to discharge all the Duties of Justice: what those are we have shewn already in the former Book. I shall now proceed to lay down some Directions, <note n="a" place="bottom">His Design is to shew, What Methods a young Man, who is just coming into the World (supposing he has laid a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Virtue) had best enter upon, that he may make himself Known, and taken Notice of among his Citizens, that so his Virtues mayn't lye hid and conceal'd.

                  </note> How a Man should do to appear before the World what he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; tho' that of <hi>Socrates</hi> is certainly the wisest that can possibly be given, <hi>To make sure in the first place,</hi>

                  <hi>that he</hi> really <hi>be in himself, that which he desires to</hi> appear <hi>before the World.</hi> For when a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is just come into the Publick, and is already known and remarkable in it; either by the Fame of his Father's Actions (which I think, Son <hi>Marcus,</hi> may be your Case;) or by any other Means or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident whatever; the Eyes of all are immediately upon him, and every one's enquiring after what he does, and how he steers his Life; and, as tho' he were set in the publick View, so none of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or so much as his Words can be long kept in secret. But those, who at the beginning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of their Lives, by reason of their Meanness, are unknown to the World; as soon as ever they come up to years of Discretion, should set before their Eyes the most honourable Places, and bend all their Studies and honest Endeavours toward the obtaining of 'em: which they ought to do with so much the more boldness, because Men are so far from envying Youth, that they rather encourage and forward 'em in their Progress. The <note n="b" place="bottom">Courage in the Wars, the first thing that makes a young Man become Remarkable.</note> first thing then, that sets a young Man off, and recommends him to the Publick, is Courage and Bravery in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Affairs; by which a great many amongst our Forefathers, who were scarce ever wholly disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd from Wars, very nobly distinguish'd and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd themselves.

In which however, when <hi>Pompey</hi> had giv'n you the Command of <note n="e" place="bottom">Each Body of Foot consisting of two Legions, had two Troops of Horse to support it, one on the right and t'other on the left. <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Son commanded one of these, being call'd <hi>Wings.</hi>

But as for this piece of your rising Glory, <hi>that,</hi> and the whole Constitution of the Republick, are both of 'em fall'n to the ground together. But I never design'd so to model this Discourse, as that it should be proper for none but you; but as that it might be applicable to all Men in general: I shall go on therefore to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of it. As then in all things the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Soul are more noble and excellent than those of the Body; so the Effects of our Reason and Understanding are greater, and more powerful as to this Particular, than those of meer Strength. <note n="f" place="bottom">Of the Virtues that don't require Strength of Body, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> most recommend a young Man.</note> Now of these there is none that can more recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and adorn a young Man, than Temperance and Sobriety, Duty and Respect to his natural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Love and Good-nature towards his Friends and Relations. <note n="g" place="bottom">A third thing that recommends young Men is, keeping frequent Company with those that are Wise, and Lovers of their Country.</note> Another good Way for young People to get Known, and have a good Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is often to attend on some Great and Wise Men, who are thought to design for the Good of the Publick: For when they're observ'd to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with such, the People are presently apt to imagin, that they'll be like those Men, whom they choose for their Patterns Thus <note n="h" place="bottom">

There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main therefore only two more, <hi>viz. Hope,</hi> when Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> promise great Donations; and <hi>Hire,</hi> when Money is given. Both these he comprehends here under <hi>Beneficence</hi> or <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and shews <hi>what</hi> sort of Donations are useful, and in <hi>what</hi> Measure, and in <hi>what</hi> particular Cases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And first he divides <hi>Beneficence</hi> into two forts, of which he prefers the former for several Reasons.</note> HAving given this Account of the particular Duties, which young Men must do for the attainment of Glory; we are next to discourse of Beneficence or Liberality. Of this there are two sorts; the one of which consists in obliging those,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64327:107"/>
who need it by our <hi>Labour and Industry;</hi> the other, by our <hi>Money.</hi> The latter of these two is much the more easie, especially for those who have plentiful Fortunes; but the former, on the other hand, more glorious and magnificent, and more suitable to the Character of a brave and exalted Soul. For tho' there's a Good-will, and generous Readiness to oblige shewn in either; yet in the one Case we are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the <hi>Chest,</hi> in the other to the <hi>Virtues</hi> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of the Person. Besides, those sort of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, which are done by the Assistance of Money or the like, within a short space of time, draw their own Fountain dry; so that this Liberality doth, as 'twere, eat out its own Bowels, and the more you have formerly oblig'd in this kind, the fewer you'll be able to oblige for the future. But now, on the other hand, he whose Generosity shews it self in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that is, in Virtue and being Active for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's good, the more Men he hath formerly shewn himself kind to, the more he'll have ready to assist him ever after: beside that by the Custom of doing good Offices, he gets a kind of Habit, and grows much more expert in the Art of Obliging. <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, reproves his Son sharply in one of his Epistles, for endeavouring to purchase the Good-will of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 'em Donations; <hi>In</hi> the name of Wonder, <hi>says he,</hi> what reason could you have, to hope that those People would ever be faithful to you, whom you your self had <hi>Corrupted</hi> with Money? <q>What! do you design to be thought not the King, but only the <hi>Steward</hi> and <hi>Purse-bearer</hi> of the <hi>Macedonians?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:64327:107"/>
That <hi>Steward</hi> and <hi>Purse-bearer</hi> is admirably well said; because 'tis so scandalous a Business for a Prince; and that calling Donations a <hi>Corrupting the People,</hi> is better yet; for those that receive 'em are perpetually the worse for it, and only made readier to expect the same again. <hi>Philip</hi> writ this to his Son alone, but it may serve for a Direction to all Men in general I think we may take it for granted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>that</hi> sort of Bounty, which consists in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kindnesses by our Labour and Industry, is more Virtuous and Creditable, can oblige more People, and has more ways of doing it, than that other has. Not but that <hi>sometimes</hi> a Man should <hi>give,</hi> nor is this sort of Bounty to be wholly rejected; nay, one ought oftentimes to distribute some part of one's Money to those, who are well-deserving Persons, and stand in need of such Assistance: But still it must be done with <note n="b" place="bottom">The word <hi>Diligentia</hi> in this place properly signifies, the making a Choice and Distinction between Persons.</note> great Prudence and Moderation. For some Men have squandered away whole Estates by inconsiderately Giving; which is certainly the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishest thing in the World; for so a Man disables himself ever after, from doing of that, <note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> Shewing his Bounty and Generosity in Giving; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has given away all already.</note> which he takes most delight in. But the worst thing is this, that Profuseness in Giving is usually accompany'd by unjust Ways of Getting: For when by this means Men have parted with what's their own, they are forc'd to lay hands upon that which is another's. And by this means they miss what is their principal Design, <hi>viz.</hi> The obtaining Men's Love, by their Bounty and Generosity; for they get more Hatred from those whom they Injure, than Good-will from those whom they hop'd to Oblige by it. We ought not therefore <hi>so</hi> to Lock up our Riches, <hi>as</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64327:108"/>
Liberality it self can't open 'em; nor <hi>so</hi> to keep 'em open, <hi>as</hi> if they were common to all Men in general: The best way is, always to observe a due Medium, and give more or less in proportion to our Estates. In fine, we'd do well to remember a Saying, which is now grown so common as to be a Proverb amongst us, <hi>Bounty has got no Bottom:</hi> For how indeed is it possible, there should ever be any end on't, when those, who are us'd to it, look to receive again; and others, from seeing them, are taught to expect the same?</p>

But <note n="c" place="bottom">Nothing of this here quoted is to be found in any of the Works of <hi>Aristotle</hi> now extant; which makes the learned <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus</hi> think, that it ought to be read <hi>Aristo,</hi> who was a <hi>Stoick</hi> Philosopher, mention'd by <hi>Seneca</hi> in his 29th <hi>Epist.</hi> and who (as we learn from <hi>Plutarch)</hi> wrote a Book upon the Subject of Riches.</note> 
                  <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with much more Reason and Judgment, reproves us for not being amaz'd at those Sums, which are daily thrown away to Caress the People: <q>Should any one (says he) when a City's besieg'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to great Streights, give a large Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for a little Cup of Water; People would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and admire at it strangely, and hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to believe it at first: but afterwards possibly, upon farther Consideration, would be ready to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, because 'twas a Case of meer Exigence and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64327:109"/>
Necessity: But yet <hi>we can see,</hi> without any thing of Admiration, those vast Charges and infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, which Men put themselves to for no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World; neither for the Relief of any Want or Necessity, nor yet for the Encrease of their Glory and Dignity: And that Pleasure of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which is principally aim'd at, is of short Continuance; and only tickles and sooths up the Meanest of the People, who themselves will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Satisfaction they receiv'd, as soon as ever the Shew and Recreation's at an end.</q> He adds moreover with a great deal of Reason, <q>That Children indeed and some trifling Women, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Slaves, and the more servile Part of those who are free, might perhaps take a Pleasure in such foolish kind of Pastimes: but that Men of true Prudence, and those who judge of things by the Rules of Reason, can by no means either commend or approve of 'em.</q> I know 'tis a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in our Republick, and <hi>has been</hi> from the time of our good Fore-fathers, to expect and demand, even from the soberest Citizens, something that is splendid and magnificent in their <note n="d" place="bottom">An Office in <hi>Rome,</hi> which required their taking care of the publick Buildings, Temples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also the publick Games on any solemn Occasion, Plays, and the like.

He begins with <hi>Giving;</hi> concerning which his first Rule is, <hi>That we should consider the Circumstances of the Person we give to.</hi>
                  </note> other sort of Giving, which proceeds from <hi>Liberality,</hi> we should not keep constantly to one certain Measure; but vary according to the Variety of Circumstances in the Persons that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. His Case (for instance) who struggles at present under some pressing Necessity, is different from his, who is well enough to pass, and only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to improve his Fortune. We should lend our Assistance in the first place to those, who are under the Burden and Weight of some Misfortune; unless they are such as deserve to be miserable: We should be ready however to forward those likewise, who desire only our Helping-hand, not so much to save 'em from being Unfortunate, as to raise 'em to some higher Degrees of Fortune. <note n="b" place="bottom">Secondly, In Giving <hi>we should consider the Person's Deserts:</hi> For Kindnesses bestow'd upon those, who don't deserve, but will make ill use of 'em, are indeed no Kindnesses. We should make honest Men the Objects of our Bounty in this kind.</note> But here we must
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64327:112"/>
be careful to acquaint our selves thro'ly with the Fitness of the Persons: for that of <hi>Ennius</hi> is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well said,
<q>I take good Actions, when ill apply'd, to become ill ones.</q>
Now that which is given to a truly honest and grateful Person, is paid us in the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he himself makes, and in the Good-will that's got by't from the rest of the World. For nothing's more pleasing to all Mankind, than Bounty bestow'd without Rashness and Precipitancy: and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men praise it so much the more, because the Liberality of every great Man, is a common kind of Sanctuary for all that are Needy. We should endeavour therefore, as far as we are able, to oblige many Men by such Acts of Generosity, as may not be forgotten as soon as ever they are over; but be remember'd by the Children and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of the Receivers, in such manner as to lay a Necessity upon 'em of shewing their Gratitude: I say <hi>Necessity;</hi> for all People hate one, that takes no care of being grateful to his Benefactors, and count him that is such Injurious to themselves; because he discourages Bounty and Liberality, and so is a common Enemy to all the poorer Sort. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this way of Giving, whereby Captives are ransom'd, and the meaner Folk enrich'd, is useful and advantagious to the Publick it self; and has frequently been practic'd by those of our Order, as appears very fully from the Oration of <hi>Crassus.</hi> That other way therefore of expending Money, which consists in making Shews for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Vulgar, ought (I think) by no means to be compar'd with this: The <hi>one</hi> comports well with the Character of a great, and a prudent Person; the <hi>other</hi> of such as Cajole the People, and look out for
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64327:112"/>
Pleasures to tickle the Fancies of the unstable Multitude. <note n="c" place="bottom">Having given some Rules for the liberal Man's direction in <hi>Giving</hi> or Spending; he proceeds in this place to do the same about <hi>Receiving;</hi> in which he would have him <hi>not be too rigorous, but courteous, complying,</hi> &amp;c.</note> And as 'tis a Duty to be generous in Giving, so is it not to be too rigorous in Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but in every Transaction of Buying, Selling, Letting and Hiring, to behave our selves towards our Neighbours and Chapmen, with all the Fairness and Courtesie imaginable; to let go something of our strict and just Rights, upon certain Occasions; to avoid all Suits and Contentions at Law, as far as can reasonably and fairly be expected; perhaps I might add, <hi>And even something farther;</hi> for in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cases to deliver up one's Right, is not only generous, but <note n="d" place="bottom">'Tis no small part of Prudence, to know when to lose; it hapning sometimes, and upon some Occasions, that 'tis the best way to act against one's present Interest, and by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a less Advantage, to gain a greater afterwards. <hi>Pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in loco negligere,</hi> says <hi>Terence, maximum interdum est lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum.</hi>

                  <hi>Theophrastus</hi> commends, and with very good Reason, another sort of Bounty, which we call <hi>Hospitality:</hi> For there's nothing, in my mind, more handsom and becoming, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to have the Houses of Noble Men open, and ready to entertain all Strangers of Fashion; and 'tis no small Credit and Reputation to the Publick,

that Strangers ne're fail to meet with that sort of Bounty, and Liberality in our City. Beside that there's nothing can be more useful for those, who design by honest Means to get an Interest in the World, than to recommend themselves to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and Good-liking of foreign Nations, by the help of those People whom they thus entertain. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> tells us of <note n="f" place="bottom">The Son of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> a famous <hi>Athenian</hi> General, who beat their Enemies both at Sea and Land the same Day: He was particularly fam'd for his Bounty and Hospitality.

                  <p>The Liberality which consists in doing good Offices for others: Two sorts of it. What sorts of Study afford most Opportunities of it. The Ruin of Civil Law and Eloquence. All Men may do Kindnesses of this Nature if they please. We should be careful of not Offending some, by Obliging others.</p>

                  <note n="a" place="bottom">He begins here with the second, and as he thinks <hi>[See Chap.</hi> 15.] much better sort of Beneficence, which consists in doing Kindnesses for others by our Labour and Industry. These Kindnesses may be either done to <hi>particular Persons,</hi> or to the <hi>Republick in general:</hi> and first of the former.</note> I Come now to speak of that other sort of Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which consists not in <hi>Giving,</hi> but in <hi>Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> for another's Good; and extends it self as to the Republick in general, so to each Member of the City in particular. <note n="b" place="bottom">The first thing that puts a Man in a Capacity of serving a great many People, is the Civil Laws; the Knowledge of which he highly commends.</note> The Civil Law principally gives us Opportunities of exercising this: For there's nothing more proper to get a Man Interest and Credit in the World, than the Managing the Law-suits of a great many Persons, the assisting 'em with his Advice, and doing for 'em all that he can by his Knowledge, and Skill in that Learning. And therefore I admire the Wisdom of our Ancestors, as for several Reasons, so particularly for this, that the Knowledge and Interpretation of their excellent Civil Law, was counted a matter of the highest Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Reputation among them. This the greatest Men have kept constantly among themselves, till this late sad Disorder and Confusion of every thing: But now the Glory of this sort of Learning, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all Honours and Degrees of Dignity, is utterly ruin'd and fall'n to just Nothing. And to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64327:114"/>
make the matter still so much the worse; all this has happen'd in the Days of <note n="c" place="bottom">He means <hi>Ser. Sulpitius,</hi> one of the most eminent among the <hi>Romans</hi> for his Skill in the Civil Laws.</note> One, who, as he equall'd in Dignity all that have gone before him, so was he far above 'em in the Knowledge of the Laws. This Study then is approv'd of by most People, and puts it in one's power to assist a great many and oblige them by Kindnesses. <note n="d" place="bottom">A second thing which enables Men to assist others this way, is Eloquence.</note> There's another sort of Knowledge near related to this, the Art, I mean, of Perswasive Speaking, which carries more Majesty and Ornament along with it, and is more pleasing and lik'd of, by the generality of Men. For what is there in the World more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary than Eloquence, whether we consider the Admiration of its Hearers, the Reliance of those who stand in need of its Assistance, or the Good-will procur'd by it from those whom it defends? Our Ancestors therefore held this among the chief of their Civil Professions. Any one then must oblige a great many, and have a large number of Clients and Dependants, who is able to speak well, and willing to take pains, and (as <note n="e" place="bottom">There was even a Law among the <hi>Romans,</hi> entitul'd, <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia de donis &amp; muneribus,</hi> forbidding to take Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Defending another's Cause.</note> 'twas the Custom of our good Fore-fathers) is ready to undertake many Mens Causes, without ever expecting to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Trouble. And here I have a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offer'd me, to bemoan the great Downfal, that I mayn't say the utter Extinction of Eloquence; but that I am afraid I shall seem to complain for my own sake only. However I can't but with some Concern take notice, what a great many excellent Orators we have lost; how few there are arising, whom we can expect any thing from; and how much fewer who are able to perform and do any thing;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64327:114"/>
and for all that, how many, who are brim full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and vain Presumption. <note n="f" place="bottom">A third Way of doing People Kindnesses is, if we aren't our selves able to manage their Causes, by recommending 'em to the Judges, to those that are skill'd in Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Now it is not for all, nor indeed very many, to be either skilful Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, or eloquent Pleaders: However there's no one, if he'd make it his Business, but may do friendly Offices to several People; either by begging some Kindnesses for 'em; or by recommending their Cases to the Judges and Officers; or by being Industrious in promoting their Interests; or lastly, by using his Endeavours with those, who either are able Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, or eloquent Orators: which whoever shall do, will make a great many be beholden to him, and get himself a general Interest in the World. <note n="g" place="bottom">He puts in a Caution or two about these Rules, <hi>viz.</hi> That whilst we oblige one, we take care not to disoblige others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> There is one thing however I would advertise him of, (tho' I think 'tis so obvious, that I hardly need do it) which is to have a care of offending <hi>some,</hi> whilst he's endeavouring to be serviceable to <hi>others.</hi> For it often comes to pass, that such do a Diskindness, either to <hi>those</hi> whom they ought to have oblig'd; or to <hi>those</hi> who are able to make 'em suffer for it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: Which shews Carelesness and Negligence, if done undesignedly; but if designedly, Rashness and Imprudence. And if it should happen that we are forc'd, tho' unwillingly, to disoblige any Person, we must endeavour to excuse it as well as we are able; by shewing the Necessity we lay under of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, and how 'twas utterly impossible for us to avoid it: and must be careful and industrious to repair the Injury, by making some reasonable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for it afterwards.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOw <note n="a" place="bottom">Having shewn what those things are, which put us into a Capacity of Helping others, <hi>viz.</hi> Eloquence, Civil Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and lay'd down a Rule or two for our Direction in doing it; he proceeds to enquire, on whom we ought especially to bestow our Kindnesses; where he puts the Question, <hi>Whether 'tis better to assist a Rich and Great, or a Poor and Honest Man?</hi> and argues for the latter; because a poor Man will be more grateful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> whenever we do a <hi>Kindness</hi> or Friendly <hi>Office</hi> to another, we usually regard one of these two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> Either the <hi>Honesty,</hi> or the <hi>Greatness</hi> of the Person. 'Tis easily said, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one's ready enough to profess, That in placing their Favours, they have much more Respect to the <hi>Merits</hi> of the Person, than to his Fortune in the World. This is very fairly and honestly spoken: but yet I'd be glad to be shewn that Man, who is more willing to Help one that's Honest and Poor, than to get the Favour of one that is Wealthy and Powerful. For who is not readiest to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to those, from whom he expects the most speedy Requital? But People would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider more throughly the Natures of things: For tho' a poor Man, 'tis true, can't make a Requital, yet if he's honest, he will acknowledge the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And 'twas no unhandsom Saying, whoever was the Author of it, <q>That in Case of a <hi>Debt,</hi> the Man who <hi>acknowledges</hi> it doth not thereby <hi>pay</hi> it; and the Man who <hi>pays</hi> it does no longer <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:64327:115"/>
it: But in Case of an <hi>Obligation,</hi> both he who <hi>returns</hi> it still continues to <hi>acknowledge</hi> it, and he who <hi>acknowledges</hi> it thereby sufficiently <hi>returns</hi> it.</q> But now those, on the contrary, who value themselves upon their Riches, Honours and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition, will scorn to acknowledge they're oblig'd for any Kindness; nay, will think they vouchsafe you a signal Favour, even whilst you are doing 'em some considerable Service; and will always be jealous and suspicious over you, as tho' you demanded and expected something from 'em: But to have it ever said they were defended by you, or to be number'd among your Dependants or Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, is as insupportable to 'em as even Death it self. Whereas your <hi>mean Person,</hi> when any one does him a friendly Office, considers 'twas done out of Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to himself, and not out of Regard to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Condition; and endeavours to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sensible of the Obligation, not to him only who has done him the Kindness, but (as standing in need of some other Mens Assistance) to those others also, from whom he hopes for the like. And if he should chance to do another any Service, he does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cry up and magnifie it, but rather to lessen it as much as he is able. Another thing worth the considering is this, That if you defend one that's wealthy and powerful, the Obligation remains in the Person himself, or perhaps just his Children; but if you protect one that's needy and forsaken, provided withal he be virtuous and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, all the lower sort of People immediately that aren't wicked (which is no inconsiderable part of the Multitude) will look upon you as their Safe-guard and Protection. Upon all which Accounts I am wholly of Opinion, That a Kindness is better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd upon <hi>an honest,</hi> than 'tis upon a <hi>wealthy</hi> and <hi>fortunate</hi> Person. We should endeavour, 'tis true,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64327:116"/>
to the utmost of our power, to be serviceable to all Men of whatsoever Condition: But if their should happen a Competition between 'em, I am clearly for following <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s Advice, who being once ask'd, <hi>How he'd Marry his Daughter, whether to one that was Poor, but Honest; or to one that was Rich, but of an ill Reputation?</hi> made Answer, <hi>I'd rather have a Man without an Estate, than have an Estate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Man.</hi> But the mighty Respect, which is paid to Riches, has wholly deprav'd and corrupted our Manners. And yet what does it signifie to any one of us, that such or such a Person has got a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fortune? Perhaps it may be useful to him that has it; tho' not <hi>so</hi> neither always: But allowing it to be so: Suppose he has got the World more at his Command; yet how (I'd fain know) is he ever the honester for it? <note n="b" place="bottom">He gives this by way of Caution, tho' he would not have a Man assisted for being Rich, he would not have his Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es be an hindrance to him neither, provided he be otherwise an honest and good Man.</note> But and if a Man be Honest, as well as Wealthy, tho' I would not have him helpt for the sake of his Riches, yet I would not have him hindred upon their account neither: But in every case have it fairly consider'd, not how Wealthy and Great, but how Good and Deserving a Person he is. <note n="c" place="bottom">The last Rule to be observ'd in this sort of Liberality.</note> I shall conclude this Head with only one Rule more, which is, Never for the sake of doing any one a Kindness, to venture upon that which is unjust in it self, or injurious to a third Person. For no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or Esteem can be solid and durable, unless built upon the Foundations of Justice and Honesty; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing can be virtuous or commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

should Want, whilst others enjoy'd what in Equity was theirs: and yet it seem'd hard on t'other side, that Men should be thrust out of those Possessions, which now they had held for these fifty Years: if more especially 'twere withal consider'd, That it could not but happen in so long a time, that they must have gone, a great part of 'em, from one to another, either by Inheritance, Purchase, Dowry, or the like; and therefore were possest by the <hi>present Incumbents,</hi> without <hi>their</hi> having injur'd the rightful Proprietors.

                  </note> twice) to make sale of their Goods in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Markets, and have them cry'd by the Voice of the Common Cryer. But this famous <hi>Grecian</hi> (as was the Duty of a wise and extraordinary Person) thought it became him to provide alike for all: And indeed every Magistrate, who proceeds upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason and Prudence, will always take care not to make any Difference between the Interests of his People; but will govern them all by the same Rule and Standard of Justice and Equity. Here's one Man shall dwell in what belongs to another: What <hi>Reason</hi> is there, I beseech you, for this; that when I have bought, built, repair'd, and laid out a great deal of Money, another should come and injoy all the Fruits of it, in spite of my Teeth?
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64327:122"/>
Is not this plainly to take away from one that which justly belongs to him, and give to another what he has nothing of Right to? As for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Forgiving Debts, I can see no Reason in the World for it, unless it be Reason, that another should buy Land with my Money, and that he should have the Land, but I never have my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

                  <hi>CAto,</hi> Son <hi>Mark,</hi> who was near of the same Age with <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> the first that had the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <note n="b" place="bottom">Because he beat <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> He was Grandfather of the Younger <hi>Africanus.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Historians are full of his Praises.</note> 
                  <hi>Africanus</hi> giv'n him, tells us 'twas an usual Saying of <hi>his, That he never was less idle, than when he was idle; nor ever less alone, than when he was alone.</hi> A noble and excellent Sentence indeed, and worthy of so great and so wise a Person; by which it appears, that in the midst of Leisure he could think of Business, and was us'd when alone to converse with his own Thoughts: so that he never was properly Idle, and needed no Company to entertain him in his Solitude. The two things
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64327:125"/>
therefore, which bring a kind of Dullness and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness upon others, serv'd but to sharpen and invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Solitude and Leisure. I wish I could truly say the same of my self! But tho' I'm not able to arrive at that inimitable Temper of Soul, I desire at least to come as near it as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and being excluded by open Violence, and <note n="c" place="bottom">Those of <hi>Caesar</hi> first; but after his Death, of <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> and his Adherents.</note> impious Arms, from having ought to do with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Senate, or Business of the Bar, I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betake my self to a Life of Retirement; and for that very reason have abandon'd the City, and am often alone, only going from one Seat to another in the Country. But alas! my Leisure is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with that of <hi>Africanus,</hi> nor my Solitude with his Solitude! For he was employ'd, at that very time, in Places of the greatest Reputation in the Publick; and his <hi>Leisure</hi> was only a voluntary Retirement, to give himself Respite from Business for a season; and his <hi>Solitude</hi> only a kind of Port or Haven, into whcih he withdrew himself from the Disturbances of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Whereas my Leisure proceeds not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny desire of Respite, but from a want of Business to Employ my self about; for what proper Work can I find to do, when there's no more <note n="d" place="bottom">The two Places in which he before us'd to shew himself.</note> a Senate, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Courts of Justice remaining <note n="e" place="bottom">Because all things were acted by Violence and Force of Arms.</note> entire, in which I might honourably shew my self? Therefore, whereas 'twas my former Custom to appear much in Publick, and in the Eye of my Citizens; I now on the contrary hide my self from 'em, to avoid the very sight of such Packs of Villains, as are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where abroad; and as much as is possible confine my self to Solitude. But since this is given us for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64327:126"/>
a Rule by the Learned, <hi>That when several Evils are threatning us at once, we should not only choose to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the</hi> least, <hi>but extract some Advantage out of</hi> 'em <hi>if 'tis possible:</hi> I therefore, in the midst of all these present Misfortunes, gain the small Advantage of Quiet and Retirement, (tho' not such a Quiet as <hi>he</hi> might have expected, whose Wisdom had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <note n="f" place="bottom">By freeing it from <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conspiracy. <hi>See chap.</hi> 22. <hi>Book</hi> 1.</note> procur'd the Peace of the Publick) and endeavour not wholly to languish out that Solitude, which not Choice, but Necessity has laid upon me. Tho' <hi>Africanus</hi> indeed, I my self must confess, has got much greater Glory by his Solitude and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement: For none of his Thoughts are committed to Writing, nor any Monuments remain of what he did in his Leisure, and when he was alone; whereby we are given to understand, That he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was idle, nor ever properly alone; because he was always employ'd in Meditation, and in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out those things, which by Thinking he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Master of. But I, who han't got such a strength of Genius, as to be content, when alone, with the company of my bare Thoughts, am forc'd to apply all my Studies and Endeavours to the drudgery of Writing: I have written more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore within a very short time, since the Ruin of the State, than I did for some Years, while 'twas in its flourishing Condition.</p>

                     <hi>The Subject of Duties the most useful part of all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. An Exhortation to his Son to be diligent in his Studies.

               </argument>
               <p>NOw tho' all Philosophy (my dear <hi>Cicero)</hi> be a rich, as it were, and plentiful Soil, which has not any part of it wast and uncultivate: yet there's no place that's more fruitful in it, or from which more Advantage accrues to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than that which is employ'd about <hi>Offices</hi> or <hi>Duties;</hi> from whence those Precepts and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are drawn, which lead toward a steddy and virtuous Way of Living. Wherefore tho' I doubt not but that <hi>Cratippus,</hi> the greatest Philosopher of our Age, is daily inculcating these things to you, and you are receiving them with that Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they deserve; yet I have thought it not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unnecessary, my self to remind you of so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Matter; and could wish that your Ears might continually ring, as it were, with such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and not hear (as far as possible) any thing else. And as this is a Method which is useful for all Men, who design to lead virtuous and credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lives; so for no one living, perhaps, more than your self. For consider you're the Son of an industrious Father, one who has born the greatest Honours in the Republick, and has gotten himself some Credit and Reputation in the World; People therefore will expect that you should follow my Steps, and 'tis your part to see that you answer their Expectation. Beside 'tis no small thing you have taken upon you, by being at <hi>Athens,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great <hi>Cratippus;</hi> whither since you are
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64327:127"/>
gone as it were to a <hi>Staple</hi> and Mart of good Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 'twill be scandalous for you to return again empty, and bring a Reproach both upon the Place and your Master. Wherefore, dear Son, be Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious and Diligent, and spare no manner of Pains and Labour (if I may call it a <hi>Labour,</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Pleasure,</hi> to Study and Learn) that you may make a good Use of these Advantages before you; and when all things are thus plentifully supply'd on my part, let it never be said, That you your self are wanting to your own greatest Interest. But I shall say no more upon this at present, having heretofore written again and again to you, by way of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Let us now proceed to the fifth and last Part of our propos'd Division. <note n="a" place="bottom">After this Discourse and Advice to his Son, he comes now to his Subject, of comparing Profit and Honesty. But <hi>tells</hi> us first, That <hi>Panaetius,</hi> tho' he propos'd, yet did not discourse upon this third Head: Shews he design'd to have done it, and is large in explaining the Sence 'tis to be taken in.</note> 
                  <hi>Panaetius</hi> then, who without all controversie has written most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately upon the Subject of <hi>Duties,</hi> and whom in this Work, with a little Alteration, I have hitherto follow'd, lays down (as was said) three general Heads, which Men use in Consulting or Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting concerning their Duty: In the <hi>first</hi> 'tis questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, <hi>Whether the Action they are going about be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest or Dishonest.</hi> In the <hi>second, Whether it be Profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or Unprofitable.</hi> In the <hi>third, How a good Man ought to determin the Case, if that which seems Honest should come into competition with that which seems Profitable.</hi> Of the two former Heads he has given us an account in his three first Books, and therein has promis'd to go on with the third of 'em; but has fail'd, it should seem, of being so good as his Word. Which I wonder at the more upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64327:127"/>
because we are told by his Scholar <hi>Possido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> That he liv'd thirty Years after those Books were publish'd. And I can't but admire at the same <hi>Possidonius,</hi> that having an occasion, in some of his Writings, to discourse upon this Argument, he should do no more than just touch upon it in short; especially seeing he himself has observ'd, That in all Philosophy there's no one Subject more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and important. Some indeed think, whom I cannot agree with, that <hi>Panaetius</hi> did not <hi>forget</hi> this Part, but <hi>omitted</hi> it on purpose; and that in plain truth, it ought to be omitted, since Profit can never be <hi>really</hi> contrary to Honesty. Whether it <hi>ought</hi> to be omitted or not, may perhaps be a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; but whether <hi>Panaetius</hi> design'd it or no, and afterwards neglected it, I think can be none: For a Writer certainly, that proposes three Heads, and goes thro' with but two of 'em, must needs design to discourse upon the third; nay he tells us himself in the close of his third Book, That he'd afterwards proceed to this remaining Part.

               <p>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Having shewn from Reason, and the Authority of <hi>Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,</hi> that <hi>Panaetius</hi> design'd to have writ upon this Head; he now proceeds to enquire, <hi>Whether he ought to have done it, or not?</hi>
                  </note> THat <hi>Panaetius</hi> therefore did think he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Discourse upon this Part, is beyond all Question: But whether he was mistaken in his Judgment or not, when he laid down this Head, as the <hi>third of deliberating for the finding out our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> may perhaps be disputed. <note n="b" place="bottom">The Reasons why <hi>Panaetius</hi> should not have brought in this Enquiry: <hi>First, Honesty is the only, or at least much the greatest Good; therefore Profit should not be made to oppose it; nothing being comparable to the greatest Good.</hi>
                  </note> For whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> we take <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> or <hi>Honesty</hi> to be the <hi>only Good;</hi> or, according to that of <hi>your Peripateticks,</hi> acknowledge it so to be the <hi>chiefest Good,</hi> as that all things else are just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against it; 'tis certain, upon either of these Suppositions, That Profit can't be put in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance against Honesty. We are therefore told, That <hi>Socrates</hi> us'd even to <hi>curse</hi> those People, who disjoyn'd these things in Thought and Conception, which are one and the same in Nature and Reality. And <note n="c" place="bottom">Secondly, <hi>The</hi> Stoicks, <hi>of whom</hi> Panaetius <hi>was one, hold that Profit and Honesty are really the same thing; therefore he should not have brought in this Head, wherein they are set in opposition to each other.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> are so far of his Opinion, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64327:128"/>
to maintain, That whatever is Honest must be also Profitable, and whatever is Profitable must be also Honest. 'Tis true had <hi>Panaetius</hi> been one of those, who assert that Virtue is therefore only desirable, because it brings something of Profit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it; like <note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his Disciples; and also <hi>Hieronymus Rhodius,</hi> whom our Author often mentions in his Works. He liv'd about the 440th Year of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had been Scholar to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle.</hi>
                  </note> some, who think nothing any further worth a-seeking for, than as it begets Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or Exemption from Pain; we could then have allow'd him the liberty of saying, That Profit is sometimes repugnant to Honesty. But seeing he was one of <note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> That of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
                  </note> a different Sect, and thinks <hi>nothing</hi> to be <hi>Good</hi> except that which is <hi>Honest;</hi> and avows that whatever is contrary to <hi>Honesty,</hi> and appears to us under the Notion of <hi>Profit,</hi> can neither, if we have it, make Life ever the better; nor, if we have it not, ever the worse; he should not, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, have brought in such a Deliberation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that, which seems Profitable, comes into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with that, which is Honest. For that, which <note n="f" place="bottom">Thirdly, <hi>The</hi> Stoicks <hi>make the whole Happiness of Man to consist in Living conformably to the Rules of Honesty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Profit should never have been brought in in opposition to it.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> call their <hi>Sovereign Good</hi> [to live in Conformity with the Dictates of Nature] means, I suppose, no more than this, That we should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways live agreeably to the Rules of Virtue; and should use other things, which are suited and adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our natural Inclinations, no further than Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue permits and allows 'em. Now this being so,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64327:129"/>
there are several of opinion, That this general Head, wherein Profit and Honesty are compar'd with one another, was improperly brought in; and that there ought not to have been given any Rules or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections upon this Subject. <note n="g" place="bottom">To what has been objected it might have been reply'd, <hi>That there's a double sort of Honesty; the one</hi> Perfect, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to none but a perfectly Wise Man; the other</hi> Middle, <hi>and which ordinary Men are capable of: That Profit ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be oppos'd to the former, but perhaps to the latter imperfectene it might.</hi> Here he gives a large account of this Division of Honesty, [See <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Book.</hi> 1.] and shews that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> or <hi>Middle</hi> sort of Honesty, ought no more to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with for the sake of any Profit, than the <hi>first</hi> or <hi>consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> one.</note> Now your <hi>Perfect Honesty,</hi> which is truly and properly call'd by that Name, is only to be found in your <hi>perfectly Wise</hi> Men, and can never be possibly separated from Virtue: But those Men, who have not this Perfect Wisdom, must by no means pretend to such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Honesty, tho' they may have some Shadows and Resemblances of it. For all <hi>those Duties,</hi> of which we are treating in these Books, have the name of <hi>Middle ones</hi> given 'em by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> which are common indifferently to all Men in general, and are not confin'd to any particular number of them. But several get 'em either by the peculiar Happiness of their Natures, or by a constant progress in Study and Learning. Whereas <hi>those others,</hi> which they call <hi>Right ones,</hi> are perfect and consummate, or (as they 'emselves express it) <hi>have all their Numbers,</hi> which none can attain to, but the <hi>perfectly Wise.</hi> 'Tis true that the Vulgar, as soon as they see any Action of such a nature, as indeed is no more than a <hi>Middle</hi> kind of Duty, are immediately thinking it a <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Compleat</hi> one: <note n="h" place="bottom">Men judge of the Perfection or Imperfection of any thing, according as it comes up to, or falls short of their Idea's. He, whose Idea is short and imperfect, will think a very mean piece of Work to be excellent, because he has no Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any thing that is more so: But an Artist will judge it (as it really is) ordinary, because his Conceptions are more refin'd and exquisite. This is the Reason why the Vulgar imagin the imperfect Virtues to be Perfect and Compleat; because they fully answer their Idea of Perfection, which is but an half and inadequate one.

sort of People can't tell what is Perfect, and by consequence don't know how much any Virtue or Excellency comes short of it: but finding it answer the highest of their Conceptions, they imagin it wants nothing of being as perfect as can be. Just as it happens in judging of Poems or Pieces of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other such like; those who aren't Judges, are generally pleas'd with and praise those things, which by no means deserve any Praise or Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Because, I suppose, there may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that's Good in 'em, which serves well enough to take with those that are ignorant, and who han't so much skill as to be able to discover their several Imperfections: Therefore when they are instructed by those who understand it, they are brought with no great difficulty to forsake their Opinions.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The greatest Men that have been in the World, were not perfectly Wise. Profit ought not to be compar'd with the Middle, any more than with the Perfect Honesty. How Men come to compare 'em together, or to doubt upon this Subject. This illustrated by an Example. One certain Rule necessary for our Guidance in this case.

               <p>THose Duties therefore, which make up the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Enquiry, by the <hi>Stoicks</hi> are counted a kind of <hi>second-rate Honesty,</hi> which is not confin'd to their Wise Men only, but is common and open to all Mankind: and therefore all those, who have any kind of Sence or Inclination for Virtue, are very sensibly touch'd and affected with <hi>it.</hi> For you aren't to imagin, when we call the two <note n="a" place="bottom">Two famous <hi>Romans,</hi> Father and Son, who both in the time of their Consulships devoted 'emselves freely for the Good of their Country: The Father in the War with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> about the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 412; and the Son in <hi>that</hi> with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> about forty Years after. <hi>See the form of it,</hi> Liv. <hi>Book</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Book</hi> 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 29.</note>

For whatever Attainments we have made in Virtue, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stand us in any mighty stead, if we ben't thus careful of holding constantly to our Duty—.

If this be so, you'll be ready to ask me, <hi>How then comes there to be any Doubt at all? And what is it that requires Consideration upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?</hi> I suppose 'tis this, That it sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens <note n="i" place="bottom">The Subject therefore of this Book is not, <hi>When a plain Duty seems opposite to our worldly Interest,</hi> viz. <hi>Riches, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or the like, to deliberate which of those two we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, our Pleasure</hi> (suppose) <hi>or our Duty:</hi> the very deliberating in such a case being impious, as he often says.

which may serve to give some Light to a great many others: Pray what greater Wickedness can there be upon Earth (if we speak in general) than for any one to Murder, not only a Man, but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Friend? And shall we therefore affirm that he's chargeable with a Crime, who has murder'd <hi>a Tyrant,</hi> tho' he were his Familiar? <note n="k" place="bottom">The <hi>Romans</hi> thought no Duties so great, as those that regarded the Maintenance of their Liberty; for the sake of which they would break thro' all other Obligations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Nay there was a Law among them, That he who kill'd a Tyrant should not be question'd for it.</note> The People of <hi>Rome</hi> I am sure won't say so, who count it one of the gloriousest Actions in the World. You'll say then, <hi>Does not Interst here carry it against Honesty?</hi> No, <note n="l" place="bottom">That is, A Tyrant is not therefore to be kill'd, because 'tis a profitable Action, tho' contrary to Honesty: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis an Honest, as well as a Profitable one.

nor whatever other Evil can befal a Man either in his Body or Fortune, as to take away any thing wrongfully from another, and do one's self a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by injuring one's Neighbour. For, in the first place, it ruins all manner of Society and Entercourse amongst Men; since 'tis plain, that if once Men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at such a pass, as to Plunder and Injure the rest of their Neighbours, out of hopes to procure some Advantage to themselves, there must follow of course a Dissolution of that Society, which of all things in the World is most agreeable to Nature. Should we suppose, for Example, that the bodily Members had, every one of 'em, gotten an Opinion, that to draw to its self all the Vigour of its Neighbours, would very much serve to encrease its own; 'tis certain the whole Body must decay and perish: And just so, should every one amongst us deprive other People of their Profits and Advantages, and take away all he could get from them, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of applying it only to his own Use; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Society and Fellowship of Mankind must of necessity be broken.

For certainly Greatness and Elevation of Soul; as also the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Courtesie, Justice and Liberality, are much more agreeable to Nature and Right Reason, than Pleasure, than Riches, than even Life it self; to despise all which, and regard 'em as just nothing, when they come to be compar'd with the Publick Interest, is the Duty of a brave and exalted Spirit: whereas to rob another for one's own Advantage is (as has been shewn) more contrary to Nature, than Death, than Pain, or any other Evil whatever of that kind. Again, Those Men live much more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, who suffer perpetual Troubles and Labours, for the Good and Preservation, were it possible, of all Men; (like <hi>Hercules</hi> of old, whom Men, as a grateful Requital for his Benefits, report to be plac'd among the number of the Gods) than

And accordingly we find it to be so in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that all the most great and extraordinary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuses, have prefer'd all the Troubles and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>former,</hi> before the Quiet and Ease of this <hi>latter</hi> way of Living.

                  <note n="a" place="bottom">This is a Conclusion from the foregoing Discouse; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for one Man to injure another is so very pernicious to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society; it follows, That no one should do any thing for his own Interest, as distinct from that of the whole Community.</note> WE should all of us therefore propose the same End, and every one think his own Interest in particular, to be the same with that of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in general: which if each one endeavour to draw solely to himself, all Union and Agreement amongst Men will be dissolv'd. <note n="b" place="bottom">To what he has prov'd in the former Chapter, <hi>That the Injuring of others for our own Advantage is the ruin of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and consequently most unnatural;</hi> it might have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, <hi>That this holds good only as to lesser Societies, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our Kin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but as for those who are of a different Tribe or Country, we are under no such Obligation of not Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them.</hi> He therefore here shews, in answer to this, the extent of this Obligation; and proves that 'tis not confin'd to those of the same Family, City, or the like, but equally comprehends all Mankind; forasmuch as all are alike sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the same Law of Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

needs be so likewise. For as to what is usually said by some Men, That they would not take any thing away from a Father, or Brother, for their own Advantage; but there is not the same reason for their <hi>ordinary</hi> Citizens; 'tis foolish and absurd: For they thrust 'emselves out from parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any Priviledges, and from joyning in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the rest of their Citizens, for the Publick Good: An Opinion that strikes at the very Root and Foundation of all Civil Societies. Others there are, who are ready to confess, That they ought to bear such a Regard to Fellow-Citizens; but by no means allow of it in relation to Strangers: Now these Men destroy that universal Society of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; which if once taken away, <hi>Kindness, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Justice</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> must utterly perish; which excellent Virtues whoever makes void, is chargeable with Impiety towards the immortal <note n="c" place="bottom">For tho' the Offence more immediately concerns the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are injur'd, yet 'tis also a Sin against God himself; since 'tis a Breach of his Laws and Commands.</note> Gods: For he breaks that Society, which they have establish'd and settled amongst Men; the closest Cement or Bond of which, is the being of Opinion, That for Men to Injure and Wrong one another for their private Interests, is an Evil that Nature is much more a verse from, than all those which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen either to the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Fortune;</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">That is, To take away any thing from another, which is an Act of Injustice, is not only a greater Evil than any of Body or Fortune, but of Mind too, <hi>(i. e.</hi> than any other Vice) except only those, which are Offences against Justice as well as it self.</note> nay, and I might add to the <hi>Mind</hi> also, provided only they ben't contrary to Justice; for that one Virtue is as 'twere, a kind Mistress and Queen of all the rest.

But what? (perhaps some Men will be apt to say) if a Wise Man be ready to perish for Hunger, must not he take away Victuals from another; tho' a perfectly useless and insignificant Fellow? Not at all; for Life it self is not so dear to me, as a setled Resolution of doing no Wrong for my private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. But suppose this good Man, almost dead with Cold, should have it in his power to take <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Cloaths away, one of the most savage and inhuman of Tyrants; would not you have him to do it? There's no great difficulty in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining such Cases: For 'tis certain if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing from another, tho' never so useless and insignificant a Creature, <hi>for no other End but to Benefit your self by it;</hi> 'tis an inhuman Action, and plainly contrary to the Laws of Nature: But if you are one, who by Living will do very great Service to the Republick, or perhaps to the Society of Mankind in general, and <hi>for that only reason take something from another;</hi> 'tis an Action that is not to be found much fault with. But in all other Cases, every Man's bound to bear his own Misfortunes, rather than to get quit of 'em by Wronging his Neighbour. You'll say then, Is not it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature, <hi>To Covet or Seize what belongs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, than to be in Sickness, or Want, or any such Evil? Yes; but withal 'tis as contrary to Nature, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all Care of the publick Interest;</hi> for 'tis a piece of Injustice: <note n="e" place="bottom">'Tis true the Laws of Nature, or Right Reason, forbid Men to take away ought from another, for their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for it would be the Ruine and Dissolution of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which they especially desire to maintain: But if it should at any time chance so to happen, that the doing of a Damage to any third Person, should be necessary to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Maintenance of that Society, then the doing it is not only allow'd, but commanded by the Law of Nature.</note> From whence it follows, That an <hi>honest, prudent</hi> and <hi>valiant</hi> Person, whose Death would bring a great Disadvantage on the Publick,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64327:135"/>
may take from an idle and useless Citizen, such things as are <hi>necessary</hi> for the Maintenance of Life, without any Offence against the Laws of Nature; which aim at the Preservation and Interest of the Publick: <hi>provided that</hi> he don't make the Love of himself, and Conceit of his own more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Merits, an occasion of Injuring and Oppressing others. For he'll perform but the Duties which Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice require of him, by thus taking care to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Publick, and upholding that (which I am often forc'd to mention) universal Society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all Mankind.

And 'twere heartily to be wish'd, That this whole destructive and impious Race, were utterly banish'd and excluded from amongst Men. Just as we cut off those Members of the Body, which have got no longer either Bloud or Spirits in 'em, and serve but to infect and corrupt the rest; so should those Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which under the Shape and Outside of Men, conceal all the Savageness and Cruelty of Beasts, be cut off, as it were, and separated from the Body and Society of Mankind. <note n="f" place="bottom">These Words shew what has been the Drift and Design of his Discourse from <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>[See there Note <hi rend="sup">h</hi>.] viz.</hi> To shew how we should determin our selves in those particular Cases, where the Knowledge of our Duty depends so much upon Times and Circumstances; as in the Instance there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Murdering a Tyrant, tho' a familiar Friend.

Now if nothing <note n="b" place="bottom">He shews that, <hi>Whatever is truely Profitable must be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest also;</hi> since Profit and Dishonesty (being one of 'em <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> and the other <hi>agreeable</hi> to Nature) can never meet both in the same Action: and therefore in rejecting Pleasures, Riches or Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when accompany'd with Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, we don't reject what is <hi>really</hi> our Interest, but only that which <hi>appears</hi> to be so.</note> be so <hi>contrary</hi> to Nature as Baseness, and nothing so <hi>agreeable</hi> to Nature as true Profit, (which is certainly so; for she always

desires what is Right, and Becoming, and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with it self, and abhors the contrary) then it necessarily follows, <hi>That whatever is Profitable can ne're have any Baseness, or Dishonesty annex'd to it.</hi> Again, <note n="c" place="bottom">Having shewn that, <hi>Whatever is Profitable must also be Honest;</hi> he here shews back again, <hi>That what ever is Honest must also be Profitable;</hi> upon which two Propositions all this Book is grounded.</note> If we were born for Virtue or Honesty, and this be the <hi>only</hi> desirable Good; (as <note n="d" place="bottom">Founder of the <hi>Stoick</hi> Sect; sirnam'd <hi>Cittieus,</hi> from <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> a Town in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where he was born.</note>

Such People therefore are impious and abominable, and deserve to be excluded from all Society, who deliberate with themselves, and make it Matter of Doubt, Whether they should choose what they see to be Honest, or wilfully commit what they know to be a Villany. For the very making a Question of such a thing is Criminal, tho' one should not proceed so far as to Execution. Those things therefore ought not to be deliberated at all upon, where the very Deliberation is Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and Dishonest. <note n="e" place="bottom">He now proceeds to a second Conclusion, drawn from his general Principle laid down, which is, <hi>Never to venture upon any thing that's Ill, out of Hopes of being conceal'd:</hi> For if Dishonesty be of it self the greatest Evil, 'tis not the being conceal'd that can make it otherwise.

This he open'd, and looking in, discover'd a dead Man's Body, of an unusual bulk, with a Ring of Gold upon one of its Fingers. This he pulls off, and puts it upon his own Finger; and then coming up, goes and joyns himself to the rest of the Shepherds; (for he was Shepherd to the King at that time.) Here he observ'd, That upon turning the Stone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Palm of his Hand, he became invisible to every body else, tho' others did not become so to him; and that upon turning it to its proper place, he immediatly became visible again, as before. Making use therefore of this lucky Opportunity, he found out a way to enjoy the Queen, and by her assistance to Murder the King, his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and to make away those, who might prove any hindrance or stop to his Designs; nor could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one possibly see or discover him in any of these

And here some Philosophers, Men of more Honesty, than Acuteness or Subtilty, cry out, <hi>That this Story of</hi> Plato<hi>'s is a meer Fiction:</hi> As tho' he had said either that it <hi>really</hi> was, or indeed <hi>could be</hi> done. No; the Meaning and Design of this Example of <hi>Gyges,</hi> and the Ring, is this: Suppose you could do any dishonest Action, for the gratifying a lustful, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous or ambitious Desire, so as that no one living could either know or suspect it, but both Gods and Men must be kept perfectly in Ignorance; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in such case, would you do it, or no? <hi>Ay, but,</hi> say they, <hi>this is an impossible Case:</hi> tho' 'tis not perhaps so impossible neither: But that which I ask 'em is, <hi>What they would do, supposing that possible, which they deny now to be so?</hi> The manner of their Arguing is somewhat odd and illiterate; for they still deny the Possibility of it, and that they will stand to; not it seems, understanding what the Force and true Import of this Supposition is. For when we put the Question to 'em, Whether they would do such an Action, or not, <hi>supposing they could conceal it?</hi> we don't ask 'em, Whether they <hi>can conceal it, or not?</hi> but put 'em, as 'twere, to the Rack or Inquisition; that so, if they say <hi>they would</hi> gratifie such Desires upon assurance of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we may know 'em to be Villains by their own Confession: But if they deny it, they may be forc'd to grant, that every base and dishonest Action, is, barely as such, to be shun'd and detested.

which appear'd to be Profitable, and yet really was not so. He pretended however, for a shew of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, that 'twas done to revenge an Affront of his Brother's, who leapt with Contempt over his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais'd Wall; a frivolous Excuse, and if true, not sufficient to serve his turn: By his Favour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether <note n="e" place="bottom">A Name given by the <hi>Romans</hi> to <hi>Romulus,</hi> after he was suppos'd to be taken up into Heaven, and enroll'd in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gods.</note> 
                  <hi>Quirinus</hi> or <hi>Romulus,</hi> I can't but think he did a very ill Action.

as not to do every thing that one handsomly can, for the sake of a Friend; so to do any thing that's Base or Dishonest, are both of 'em equally contrary to one's Duty.

This coming abroad, there was one <hi>Pythius,</hi> a Goldsmith or Banker at <hi>Siracuse,</hi> who told him, Indeed he had no Gardens to sell, but such as he had were at <hi>Canius</hi>'s Service, if he pleas'd to make use of 'em, as much as tho' they were his own: And withal he desir'd him to come next day, and take a Dinner with him there. When <hi>Canius</hi> had promis'd him to come accordingly, what does he do but send immediately for some Fishermen, (having Interest enough, by reason of his Calling, with all sorts of People) and desires 'em the next day to fish before his Gardens; giving 'em their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64327:146"/>
about what he'd have 'em do. <hi>Canius</hi> came at the time appointed, and <hi>Pythius</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a very splendid Entertainment for him: Just before the Garden, where he could not but take notice of it, was a company of Fisher-boats; and every one of the Men in particular brought the Fish he had caught, and laid 'em down before <hi>Pythius. How now</hi> Pythius! (says <hi>Canius</hi> to him) <hi>what all these Fish here? All these Boats? O lack, Sir,</hi> (says t'other) <hi>that's no great Wonder; all the Fish that supply the City must be taken here: this is their common Water; none of these People could ever live, if it were not for my House. Canius</hi> immediately was all on fire, and beg'd of <hi>Pythius</hi> that he would sell him the Place. He pretended abundance of Unwillingness at first; but at length (to make short of it) was brought to a Compliance. <hi>Canius</hi> buys it, together with all that belong'd to it; and being very Rich, and desirous of the Purchase, gives as much for it as <hi>Pythius</hi> demanded. Security's given and taken for the Money, and the whole Bargain finally brought to a conclusion. The next Day <hi>Canius</hi> invites some Acquaintance thither, and he comes himself somewhat earlier than ordinary; but sees not one of the Fishermens Boats there. Hereupon he enquires of one of the next Neighbours, whether or no that were any Holiday with the Fishermen; because he saw none of 'em thereabouts. Not that I know of, replies the other; but they none of 'em ever use to fish here, and therefore I wonder'd what the matter was Yesterday.

him orders to pull that down, which was such an hindrance to their Business. Instead of this <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> puts a Bill over the Door, <hi>That the House was to be sold;</hi> and quickly put it off, <hi>P. Calpurnius Lana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> being the Man that bought it. The Augurs in a short time sent him the same Orders, and he accordingly took care to perform them. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards coming to understand, That <hi>Claudius</hi> had not set the House to sale, till after he had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the Augurs to demolish it; he brought in against him an Action at Law, <hi>To receive such Satisfaction, as in Conscience and Equity he was bound to make him. Marcus Cato,</hi> the Father of him that is now living (for as others are distinguish'd by the Names of their Fathers, so he that begot this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Person should be nam'd from his Son) sat as Judge in the Case; and gave this Sentence upon the whole matter, That since <hi>Claudius</hi> knew this Inconvenience before-hand, and did not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it when he sold the Estate, he was oblig'd in Equity to make it good to the Purchaser. He judg'd it therefore to be a part of Honesty, That the Seller should fairly declare to the Buyer, all the Faults which he knows in the thing to be sold. If then this Judgment were just and equitable, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Merchant that brought the Corn, nor the supposed Seller of the infectious House did well in concealing what either of 'em knew. But all the particular sorts of Concealing could never be taken notice of by the Laws of the City; however such as could were very carefully provided against. <hi>M. Marius Gratidianus,</hi> a <note n="d" place="bottom">Son of one <hi>M.

The Business came at last to a Suit in Law, where <note n="f" place="bottom">The two famous Orators mention'd above, and brought in speaking in his <hi>de Oratore;</hi> where he mentions this very Cause.</note> 
                  <hi>Lucius Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> took part with <hi>Orata,</hi> and <note n="f" place="bottom">The two famous Orators mention'd above, and brought in speaking in his <hi>de Oratore;</hi> where he mentions this very Cause.</note> 
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> with <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidianus. Crassus</hi> insisted very much upon the Law, which says, That the Seller shall make good those Faults, which he himself knew of, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd 'em from the Buyer: <hi>Anthony</hi> on the other side argu'd for Equity, That <hi>Sergius</hi> could not but know that Incumbrance, who had sold the House himself but a little while before; and therefore what need was there of telling him of it? That he could not complain of being any ways trick'd upon, since he knew very well the condition of what he bought.

               </argument>
               <p>BUt <note n="a" place="bottom">The Difference between the Laws and Philosophers, as to taking away Wickedness, is cheifly this: That those can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the outward Actions only, but these inform the Mind and Understanding: those can only punish the actual Crimes of Delinquents, but these by informing the Judgment, and improving the Reason, take care to prevent the Commission of 'em; and keep Men from Vice out of a Love of Virtue, whereas the Laws can only terrifie them from it by fear of Punishment.</note> the Laws take one way to root these Frauds out, and Philosophers another; the <hi>former</hi> med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no further with them, than as they break out into open Acts, and may (as 'twere) be laid hold on by the Hands of Justice: the latter endeavouring to hinder their breaking out, and to prevent them by Precepts of Wisdom and Reason. Reason therefore requires of us, That we do nothing Treacherously, nothing Deceitfully, nothing meerly by outward Shews and false Pretences. Now is it not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery to set up a Trap, tho' one does not raise and pursue the Beasts into it; for the simple Creatures of themselves will run into it, without being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Just so you offer an House to be sold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of some Faults which you know to be in it;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64327:151"/>
and put up your Bill, as it were like a Trap, in which some unwary sort of Body will be taken. I know <hi>that,</hi> at present, the depravation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and prevalence of evil Custom, have made this be counted neither Base nor Dishonourable; and <hi>that</hi> 'tis tolerated by the Laws and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Publick,</hi> but I am sure 'tis not tolerated by the Laws of Nature. For 'tis to be consider'd (I must repeat it again, tho' I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd it a great many times) that there is such a thing as Natural Society, which comprehends all Men, and ties and unites 'em to one another: There's a nearer between those of the same Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and a nearer yet, between those of the same City. Therefore our Fore-fathers made a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, between <note n="b" place="bottom">The Law of Nations is nothing else, but some Rules and Maxims of the Law of Nature, which Reason tells us we ought to observe, in our Actions and Entercourse with all Men whatever. This is not so distinct from <hi>that</hi> of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cities, as tho' <hi>this</hi> could command any thing contrary to the former. No; the Laws of every City must be allow'd by Reason, and suppose it as their Foundation; but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin some things, which Reason has left indifferent, and descend to some Particulars as to Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Reason does not meddle with.</note> that Law which is common to Nations, and that which belongs to each City in particular. Whatever we are bound, <hi>by the Civil Constitutions,</hi> to do to our Citizens; we are <note n="c" place="bottom">Because the Civil may add, tho' it can add nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to that of Nations.</note> not oblig'd, <hi>by the Law of Nations,</hi> to do the same to Strangers: but <note n="d" place="bottom">Because <hi>that of Nations</hi> is still in force and obliges, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what the <hi>Civil</hi> may have added to it. The building upon a Foundation does not take away the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self.</note> whatever we are bound by this <hi>latter</hi> to do to others, the same we ought to do to our Citizens also: But <note n="e" place="bottom">The Laws and particular States consider Men, as now they are in the World, and only regulate their outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so as to preserve the Peace and Safety of the Publick: But those of Nature or Right Reason, in the Observation of which consists the <hi>perfectest Justice that Men are capable of;</hi> considers Men as they ought to be, and commands all that Purity, Sincerity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that becomes the Perfection of a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Nature; which is more than the <hi>Civil</hi> can possibly do. The <hi>Nature of God</hi> is the true Standard of genuin Right and perfect Justice: <hi>Right Reason,</hi> which is taken from the Nature of God, is an original Piece; which, tho' in no wise equal to the living Standard, is at least agreeable to it as far as it reaches: The <hi>Civil Laws</hi> are taken from Reason, and are only a Copy and faint Representation of it; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 'twere to be wish'd that, such as it is, it were carefully follow'd. This is the Sence, in which I take this place.</note> the Law, which at present we
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64327:151"/>
use amongst us, is far from being an original Piece, immediately taken from genuin Right and true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Justice; 'tis only a Copy and faint Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it. However I could wish we liv'd up e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this; for 'tis copy'd at least from some of the best Originals, which were drawn from the Truth and Nature of the thing. For how excellent is that Form in judicial Proceedings, <hi>Uti ne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That I mayn't be Defrauded or brought to an Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by trusting to you, and your Honesty!</hi> And how incomparable that other, <hi>That Honest Men do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is Honest and without Design.</hi> But the great Question is, Who they are <hi>that are Honest Men;</hi> and what 'tis <hi>to do nothing, but that which is Honest!</hi>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64327:152"/>
Entercourse of Mankind; and <hi>that</hi> 'twas the part of an extraordinary Judge, to determin exactly, all these Cases, what one Man ought to make good to another, upon only the bare Principles of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Honesty;</hi> especially seeing Men differ in their Judgments about the greatest part of 'em. All Craft therefore should utterly be banish'd, and that <hi>knavish</hi> sort of <hi>Cunning,</hi> which would fain indeed be <hi>counted,</hi> but is the farthest <hi>from Prudence,</hi> of any thing in the World: For Prudence consists in the making a right Distinction between Good and Evil, but this kind of Cunning gives the preference to Evil; if, at least, it be true (as most certainly 'tis) that every thing is Evil, which is contrary to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty. Neither is it only in <hi>Farms</hi> and <hi>Houses,</hi> that the Laws of the City, which are copied from Nature, take care to have Cheating and Knavery punish'd; but in Slaves they exclude all Fraud in the Seller: For he that's presum'd to know what the Slave was, if he does not declare whether he be Healthy, a Runagate, or apt to Steal, is answerable to the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by an Order of the Aediles: But this does not hold in the Case of <note n="g" place="bottom">Because he being newly come to the Estate, of which Slaves were a part, is presum'd not to know whether they are Healthy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or not.</note> an Heir. From what has been said, it apparently follows, <note n="h" place="bottom">That is, The Laws command, that no one should En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich himself by Cheating another; and the Laws are copied from Reason; whence it follows, that Reason commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

and Integrity. A Will that was forg'd, of one <hi>Minutius Basilus,</hi> a wealthy Person, was brought by some People out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> who, to make it the more easily pass for good, made <note n="a" place="bottom">Both mention'd before, <hi>ch.</hi> 8. <hi>Book</hi> 1. and <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>Book</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> and <hi>Lucius Hortensius,</hi> the two greatest Men at that time in the City, Joint-Heirs with themselves: who, tho' they suspected the whole to be a Forgery, yet having nothing of hand in't themselves, they made little scruple of getting an Advantage by other Peoples Villany.

For if he be unjust, that don't keep off Injuries from any of his Neighbours, and defend and protect 'em as far as he's able, (as I've shewn already in the <note n="d" place="bottom">

knavish and servile Flatteries, not by a <hi>real,</hi> but pretended Friendship, are Scandalous and Dishonest.

                  </note> Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Gratidianus</hi> act the part of an Honest and Fair-dealing Man, in the time of his Praetorship: The Tribunes of the People held a common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation with the Company of Praetors, about set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Value and Rate of Money; which at those times was grown to be so very Unconstant, as that no body could be certain how much he was Worth. They made an Edict by common Consent, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Action against those who transgress'd it, and appointing a Penalty for those who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed. This being order'd, they agreed to meet again in the Assembly after Noon, and all of 'em together tell the People what they had done. The Meeting broke up, and the rest all departed some one way, and some another: <hi>Marius</hi> only directly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64327:156"/>
from the Court went down to the Assembly, and by himself alone declar'd that to the People, which all of 'em had agreed upon by general Consent. If you ask now what was the Event of this; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World could have got him greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; Statues erected for him about the Streets; Frankinsence and Tapers burnt at every one of 'em; and, in short, never was any Man more ador'd by the Multitude. These are the things, which do sometimes mislead Men in deliberating about their Duty; when the Offence against Honesty seems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trivial, but the Advantage that's gain'd by it very considerable. Thus <hi>Marius</hi> thought it but a little piece of Knavery, to steal the Peoples Love from the Tribunes and his Collegues; but a mighty Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be made Consul by it, which was what he at that time propos'd to himself. But in all these Cases there's only one Rule, which I desire you'd constantly take along with you: <hi>Be sure in the first place, that what you count Profitable be no way Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest; and if it be Dishonest, then assure your self that 'tis not truly Profitable.</hi> And can we then esteem either the one or the other of these <hi>Mariuses</hi> Good Men? Consider a little and examin your own Thoughts, that you may see what Idea, what Notion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception you have of a Good Man. Is it reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then with the Character of such a one, <note n="e" place="bottom">As the former <hi>Marius</hi> did, in accusing <hi>Metellus.</hi>
                  </note> to Lie for the sake of his own Advantage; to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to raise false Reports and Misrepresentations of others; <note n="f" place="bottom">As his Kinsman <hi>Gratidianus</hi> did the favour of the People from the Tribunes, and his Collegues.</note> to Seize that before-hand, which others have a Right to as well as himself?

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64327:156"/>
and Reputation of a <hi>Good Man?</hi> Can that, which we call by the name of Profitable, bring us any thing so good as what it takes away from us, if it spoil our being counted Men of Honesty and Integrity? if it occasion the loss of our Justice and Faithfulness; that is, in plain truth, if it change us into Brutes?

by <hi>Fabricius,</hi> then a second time Consul, and the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, in the War with <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> For when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had voluntarily made War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Contention was held about Empire and Mastery, with a no less powerful than generous Adversary; a Deserter came secretly into <hi>Fabricius</hi>'s Camp, and offer'd, upon condition he might be well Rewarded, to return back again with the same secresie that he came, and to Poyson <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus.</hi> But instead of Encouragement, <hi>Fabricius</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to be sent back to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards commended by the Senate for so doing. If we look no further now than the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of what seems to be Profitable, here's a dangerous War, and a powerful Adversary of the growing Empire, might soon have been remov'd by the single assistance of this one Deserter: But then it would have been an eternal Scandal, not to mention the Villany and Wickedness of it, in an honourable War, which was manag'd with a fair and generous Enemy, not to get the Victory by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Courage, but only by base and treacherous Practises. Whether was more Profitable then for <hi>Fabricius,</hi> who was such in this City as <hi>Aristides</hi> was at <hi>Athens;</hi> or for the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, which never thought any thing dishonourable their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; to contend with an Enemy by Valour or by Poyson?

                  <hi>which they had pay'd, be return'd 'em.</hi> This Advice of his was follow'd by the Senate, to the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparagement and Shame of the Empire; for even Pirates at this rate will sooner be trusted, than the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate. Well, but the publick Revenues were encreas'd by it, and <hi>therefore</hi> 'twas Profitable: Heavens! How long will Men dare to call any thing Profitable, which is not Honest!

                  <hi>HEcaton</hi> proposeth, in his sixth Book of Offices, several Questions such as these which follow: Whether a Good Man, in time of great Scarcity, may refuse to give Victuals to the Servants of his own Family? He discourses indeed upon either side the Question, but at last concludes, That he should rather be guided by his Interest, than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. He demands again, If a Merchant in a Storm be forc'd to throw his Goods over-board, whether of the two should he choose to cast away, a very valuable Horse, or a Servant that's good for nothing? Here Interest, and the saving of his Goods draws one way, and compassion of Human Nature another. Should a <hi>Fool</hi> in a Shipwrack have gotten a Plank, may a <hi>Wise</hi> Man take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him if he can? He answers, No; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it would be plainly a piece of Injustice: But what if the Owner of the Ship should come? may not he take it away when it properly belongs to him? No, not at all; no more than he may throw a Man out of the Ship, under the pretence that the Ship belongs to him: For till they are arriv'd whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ship was hired for, it does not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to the Owner, than it does to the Passengers by whom it was hired. Suppose two Men, that are equally Wise, should both of 'em in a Shipwrack lay hold of the same Plank; may either of 'em seize upon it forcibly to himself, or
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:64327:160"/>
should one of them voluntarily yeild it to the other? Let one yield to the other; provided <hi>that</hi> other will be more serviceable to the Publick, or there is more depending upon his Life and Preservation. But what if <hi>these</hi> are equal in either of them? Why then there's no more to be said about it, but it must e'en be let alone for Chance to determin, as tho' they should cast Lots, or <note n="b" place="bottom">What <hi>Micare,</hi> the word here us'd, signifies. <hi>See ch.</hi> 19.</note> play at Even and Odd for it. What if a Father should rifle Temples, and dig Passages under-ground into the Treasury? Should the Son discover him to the Publick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate? No; that were an horrid unnatural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety: he should rather on the contrary defend his Father, if any one else should pretend to accuse him. But what! ought not the Interest of my Country to be consulted, before that of any one else what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever? Yes undeniably; but then it is very much the Interest of your Country, to have Citizens that are dutiful and obedient to their Parents. But if a Father should attempt to make himself King, or any ways endeavour to betray his Country; should a Son in such a case hold his Tongue and Conceal it? In the first place, let him <hi>beg</hi> of his Father to desist: if that does no good, let him proceed to rebuke and even to threaten him about it: but if at last he perceive that it <hi>directly</hi> tends to the Ruin of his Country, he should prefer <hi>its</hi> Safety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of his Father. Another of the Questions he proposes is this, Suppose a Good Man to receive, by an oversight, bad Money for good, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come to understand that 'tis bad; may he pay it for good, if he owes another any thing? <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> thinks he may, but <hi>Antipater</hi> not; whom I rather assent to. Suppose a Man be a selling a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Wine, which he knows won't keep; is he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64327:160"/>

               <p>ARe we bound to perform all those Promises and Bargains, which (in the Praetor's Language) have neither Force nor Fraud in them? Here's a Man, for Example, that has gotten the Dropsie, and another prescribes him an infallible Cure for't,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64327:161"/>
upon Condition that he'll never make use of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Man recovers by its help at present, but falls again, some time after, into the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper. Suppose now that he, to whom he made such Promise, will by no means allow him to use the Cure again; what would be his Duty in such a Case! Why, since he, who denies him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, is Inhuman, and 'tis <note n="a" place="bottom">No one's oblig'd to perform any Promise, when 'twill but bring a Loss and Inconvenience on himself, and do no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Person 'twas made to. For why should that be demanded of me, which can do no body any Good, but me a great Diskindness? Or what reason is there a thing should be done, which brings a great deal of Harm, and no manner of Good with it?</note> a thing that will do him no manner of Prejudice, 'tis the best way to take care of his Life and Safety. A Good and Wise Man is desir'd by one, who appoints him his Heir, and leaves him by Will a considerable Estate, that before he enters upon the Possession of it, he should Dance at Noon-day in the open Streets; and this he accordingly Promises to do, because otherwise the Testator would not make him his Heir: would you have him perform now what he promis'd, or not? I could wish that he never had promis'd it at all, which I think would much better have suited with his Character: But since he <hi>has</hi> done it, if he think it dishonourable to Dance so in publick, the best way will be not to stand to such a Promise, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he takes none of the Money that was left him. Unless the Money may be turn'd to some very great Benefit and Advantage of the Publick; so that 'twould be no Disgrace for a Man <note n="b" place="bottom">For an Action offending against outward Decency and Modesty, such as Dancing is, ought to give place to an Action of Justice; such as is the doing a real Kindness to the Publick.</note> even to Dance, when it brings so much Good to his Country along with it.</p>

               <p>NEither is one bound to perform those Promises, which are hurtful and prejudicial to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they were made to. Thus Father <hi>Phoebus</hi> (<note n="a" place="bottom">For he mention'd 'em in <hi>Book</hi> 1. and the Fable of <hi>Gyges</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 9. of this.</note> that we may return to our Fables) promis'd to grant <note n="b" place="bottom">

'Twas accordingly granted him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could get to be well setled in it, he was struck down with Lightning. How abundantly better had it been, in such a Case, if the Father had refus'd to perform such a Promise? The same may be said of another, which <note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Theseus</hi> married <hi>Hippolyte,</hi> Queen of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> by whom he had <hi>Hippolytus.</hi> Afterwards he married <hi>Phaedra,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Minos</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> who fell in Love with <hi>Hippolytus.</hi> He neglecting her, she (in Revenge) complain'd to her Husband, That he would have lain with her. <hi>Theseus</hi> in a rage desir'd <hi>Neptune</hi> to destroy him, which he did.

                  <hi>Theseus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of <hi>Neptune:</hi> This God had promis'd to do any three things for him, whatever he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: and he requested the Death of his own Son <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> upon a false Suspicion, that he had been naught with his Mother-in-law. He obtain'd what he ask'd; which occasion'd him very much Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

and Affliction. Again, <note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Diana</hi> being angry with <hi>Agamemnon</hi> for having slain a Stag of hers, kept the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fleet, that was going to <hi>Troy,</hi> at <hi>Aulis</hi> by contrary Winds. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to appease her, vow'd to Sacrifice the beautifullest thing at that time in his Dominions; which proving to be his own Daughter, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd her.

                  <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had vow'd, for a Sacrifice to <hi>Diana,</hi> the most beautiful thing that was born that Year in his whole Dominions. To be as good as his Word, he was forc'd to offer his Daughter <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> than whom nothing that Year had been born more beautiful. Had not it been <note n="e" place="bottom">Unlawful Oaths, Vows or Promises are not to be kept, because no Man can ever oblige himself to that, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a former and superior Obligation. We are all by God oblig'd to the Performance of such and such Duties, therefore we can't be oblig'd to the contrary by an Act of our own. But here we must distinguish between those which are Unlawful <hi>as to the Manner</hi> or Circumstances of them, and those that are Unlawful <hi>as to the Matter</hi> they are about. The first is by some call'd <hi>Jaramentum illicitum;</hi> and the second, <hi>De re illicita.</hi> All hasty and rash Oaths are Unlawful in the first Sence, by which we are oblig'd for all that; provided the Subject they are about be Lawful.

In some Cases then a Man is not oblig'd to perform his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: no more is he to restore what was given him in Trust. Suppose, for the purpose, a Man in his Wits had entrusted you with his Sword, and should demand it of you again when he's beside himself; your Duty would be not to give it him again, and if you did, you'd be guilty of a very great Errour.

Certainly no; for this would be to act against the Publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, which ought to be preferr'd before every thing else. Thus a great many things, which are Honest of themselves, we may see cease to be so when the Circumstances alter: to perform a Promise, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to stand to an Agreement, or deliver up a Trust, ought not to be done when they become Unprofitable. This may suffice to have been said of those things, which a <note n="g" place="bottom">

But supposing the worst, Pray what hurt could <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Vengeance have done <hi>Regulus,</hi> greater than what <hi>Regulus</hi> did to himself? It could not be any thing of Religion therefore, that hindred him from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing what appear'd to be his Interest.

Beside, pray remember that Sentence of <hi>Accius,</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might be said by an impious King, is yet generally acknowledg'd to be very well said, who when one told him, <hi>You have broken your Oath to</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He answers the first part of the Arguments brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Regulus. <hi>The Sacredness of an Oath. The Divinity of</hi> Faith. <hi>Pain none, or at least not the greatest Evil. Dishonesty the greatest, if not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evil. Faith to be kept even with those who are Treacherous. Oaths made to Enemies should be kept. Not so those made to Pirates, and why. What 'tis to Forswear one's self. The Form of Oaths among the</hi> Romans. <hi>Laws of War to be kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">He begins with answering the first Argument brought against <hi>Regulus;</hi> and shews what is to be regarded when People take Oaths.</note> FIrst then they say, <hi>He could fear no Harm from the Anger of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>who neither can be Angry, nor do Harm to any body.</hi> This proves as strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Oaths in general, as it does in particular against this of <hi>Regulus.</hi> But the thing to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in Peoples taking of Oaths, is not what Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are in, shou'd they break 'em; but what a sacred and powerful Obligation is laid upon 'em. For every Oath is a religious Affirmation; and whatever is promis'd after such a manner, as it were calling God for a Witness to your Words, ought certainly to be perform'd. For now <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> require it of us, and not any Fear of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Gods, which is not incident to their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Natures.

                  <note n="d" place="bottom">He comes to answer the second Argument against <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus.</hi>
                  </note> But, secondly, they tell us, <hi>Supposing</hi> Jupiter <hi>had been Angry with</hi> Regulus, <hi>he could not have brought any Evil upon him, greater than what</hi> Regulus <hi>brought upon himself.</hi> This, I confess, would be very true, if there was no other Evil but only Pain: But <hi>that</hi> is so far from being the greatest Evil, that, if we may credit some of the <note n="e" place="bottom">The <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who (as was before observ'd) allow'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be Evil, but what concern'd the Soul and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; calling the Calamities of the Body or Fortune, such as Pain or Poverty, indifferent things.</note> chief Philosophers, it is not so much as any Evil at all: Among whom, I pray you, let <hi>Regulus</hi> be counted of <hi>no small</hi> Authority; if I may'nt rather say of the <hi>greatest and most weighty:</hi> For what greater Testimony can any one desire, than that of a principal Man among the <hi>Romans;</hi> who rather than be wanting in any point of his Duty, chose to undergo the most exquisite Torments? <note n="f" place="bottom">The third Argument against him, answer'd.</note> 
                  <hi>But of two Evils,</hi> say they, <hi>always choose the least:</hi> That is, in plain words, <hi>Rather be a Rogue than undergo any Calamity.</hi> Can any Calamity then be greater, than that of Baseness and Injustice? For if even the Filth and Deformity of the <hi>Body</hi> be loathsome and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64327:167"/>
offensive; how much more so must <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> needs be, when 'tis cover'd and polluted with Shame and Dishonesty? Those Philosophers therefore, who discourse of these things with most Closeness and Severity, venture bodly to affirm, <hi>That nothing is Evil but only what's Dishonest:</hi> and even those themselves, who do it more loosly, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acknowledge, <hi>That 'tis the greatest however of all Evils.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">The fourth Argument, taken out of <hi>Accius</hi>'s Tragedy of <hi>Atreus,</hi> answer'd.</note> That Saying of the Poet's indeed is good, <hi>I neither am, nor have been tied by Oath to a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deceiver;</hi> but 'tis therefore so, because when <hi>Atreus</hi> was brought upon the Stage, he was to make him speak that, which was suitable to his Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But if once they begin to lay down this for a Maxim, <hi>That Faith, when given to those who are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, is not to be kept;</hi> they had best have a care, that this be not made a Refuge and Cover for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. <note n="h" place="bottom">Answer to the fifth Argument, <hi>His Oaths being made to an Enemy.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>As for his Oaths being made to an Enemy;</hi> even War it self has Laws that belong to it; and Faith, except in some very few cases, is always to be kept even with our greatest Adversaries. For whatever you swear, for Example, in such a manner, as that <note n="i" place="bottom">So I understand the words, <hi>Ut mens conciperet,</hi> &amp;c. not as tho' it were <hi>Mens deferentis;</hi> for I am not bound to perform whatever I Swear, according to the Mind of him that gives the Oath; for it may be unlawful, or the like. Beside 'tis unreasonable to interpret Oaths, just according to the Mind of the Imposer: He may have his private Meanings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as the Receiver. <hi>See upon this whole Subject</hi> Sanderf. Grotius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> your Conscience tells you it ought to be done, you are bound most inviolably to perform it: But where it is otherwise, you don't lie under any such Obligation; and are not perjur'd, tho' you should not perform it. Suppose, for the purpose, you had sworn to a Pirate, That you would pay him such
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64327:168"/>
a Sum, if he'd spare your Life; it would not be Perjury, tho' you should not pay it him. <note n="k" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> does not like this Decision of <hi>Gicero</hi>'s: because in an Oath we are not only to consider the Person's Right whom we Swear to; but God also, by whom we Swear. 'Tis true, the Pirate can demand nothing in this case, but the Majesty of God, by whom I swore, lays an Obligation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance upon me. But <hi>Pufendorf de Jur. N. &amp; G.</hi> Book 4. chap. 2. §. 9. seems rather to favour our Author's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> For a Pirate is by no means a lawful Adversary, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a common Pest and Enemy of Mankind; so that no one's oblig'd to keep his Faith or Oath with him. For to Swear to a thing, and yet not perform it, is not immediately to <hi>Forswear</hi> one's self: But then a Man is properly said to be <hi>Perjur'd,</hi> when he Swears <note n="l" place="bottom">That's the meaning of <hi>Ex Animi sententia,</hi> and not <hi>with design of Obliging your self.</hi> Oaths would signifie just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, if they oblig'd no further, than People design'd to be oblig'd by them. 'Twas the Form of Oaths among the <hi>Romans,</hi> Do you Swear such a thing is so or so, <hi>Ex Animi tui sententia?</hi> which words signifie either <hi>according to your Mind,</hi> or <hi>upon your Conscience.</hi> Hence that Jest which our Author quotes in his <hi>de Orat. Cato</hi> the Censor ask'd a Man, Have you a Wife or not, <hi>Ex Animi tui sententia?</hi> meaning, <hi>upon your Conscience</hi> or Oath: To which he answers, <hi>Non qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ex Animi mei sententia;</hi> meaning, <hi>Not according to my Mind or Liking.</hi>
                  </note> upon his Conscience (as our Form runs) to do such and such things, and yet does not do them. For that of <hi>Euripides</hi> may be said in <note n="m" place="bottom">When, for Example, a Man only reads or repeats the words of an Oath, or the like. <hi>See</hi> Grot. <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. §. 2.</note> some Cases to be very good, <hi>My Tongue indeed Swore, but my Conscience did not Assent.</hi> But had <hi>Regulus,</hi> in his Case, done any thing contrary to the Laws, and Conditions, that are kept between Enemies, it had been down-right Perjury.

                     <hi>C.

The Senate that they might not be bound to the League, deliver'd the Author of it up to the Enemy.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64327:169"/>
the same; who having, without any Orders from the Senate, struck up an Alliance with those of <note n="c" place="bottom">A small Town in <hi>Spain,</hi> which with a very few Men held a War against the <hi>Romans</hi> fourteen Years, and beat them several times: At last 'twas raz'd by the Younger <hi>Africanus.</hi>

This Man now let the Appearance of Profit prevail over Honesty; but in all the others mention'd, the Authority of Honesty easily carry'd it from the pretended Profit. <note n="e" place="bottom">He returns to his Defence of <hi>Regulus,</hi> and answers the other Arguments urg'd against him.</note> But to go on with <hi>Regulus:</hi> Another thing urg'd by his Adversaries is this, <hi>That he should not have perform'd what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly put upon him.</hi> As tho' a Man of Courage could be wrought upon by Force, <hi>But why,</hi> say they, <hi>did he go at all to the Senate, being resolv'd to disswade the Delivery of the Captives?</hi> This is to blame him for that, which particularly deserves Commendation: He would not depend upon his own Judgment, but pleading for that which he thought most Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, left it to be determin'd by the Judgment of the Senate: And had not it been for his Counsel in the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64327:169"/>
Case, the Prisoners had surely been sent again to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and he remain'd safe in his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: But this he concluded would be a Prejudice to the Publick; and therefore esteem'd it to be no more than his Duty, to speak what he thought, and endure what might come of it. Lastly, They add, <hi>That whatever makes highly for one's Profit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, thereby becomes Honest.</hi> I answer, That it <note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Fieri</hi> signifies to be made, and <hi>esse</hi> actually to be: The meaning is, That a thing which is very Profitable may <hi>be</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Honest; but it can't <hi>be made</hi> Honest by its being Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it were otherwise Dishonest.</note> may indeed antecedently. <hi>be</hi> such, but can never <hi>thereby become</hi> such: For nothing is Profitable but what is Honest; and things don't <hi>become</hi> Honest by their first being Profitable, but <hi>become</hi> Profitable by their first being Honest.

The Sacredness of an Oath, tho' extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Force, among the ancient</hi> Romans. <hi>This il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by the Example of</hi> Pomponius <hi>and</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt the only thing that deserves our Admiration, in all this glorious Conduct of <hi>Regulus,</hi> is his persuading the Senate not to restore the Capives. As for his returning again to <hi>Carthage,</hi> 'tis true we admire it in our Days, but at those times he could not have possibly avoided it. The Age, I think,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64327:170"/>
therefore should rather be commended for <hi>that,</hi> than the Man. For there's nothing our Ancestors took greater care of, than that the Tie of an Oath should be always held as most Sacred and Inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This appears plainly from the XII Tables; it appears from those Laws which are call'd <note n="a" place="bottom">Because the Commons, thinking they were oppress'd by the Nobles, rais'd a Sedition, and retiring to a place call'd <hi>Sacer mons,</hi> refus'd to return till such and such Privileges were granted them by the Senate. The Laws made upon that occasion were call'd <hi>Sacratae. See</hi> Livy <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 32, 33. <hi>and</hi> Paul. Manut. de Leg. Rom. <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratae;</hi> it appears from the strict Observation of Leagues, by which we're oblig'd to keep Faith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Enemies; and lastly, it appears from the Punishments and Penalties which have been inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Censors; who in no one thing have been more severe, than in punishing those, who had transgress'd their Oaths. <hi>M. Pomponius,</hi> a Tribune of the People, once enter'd an Action against <note n="b" place="bottom">Sirnam'd <hi>Imperiosus,</hi> a valiant and noble <hi>Roman;</hi> he was chose Dictator upon a Religious Account, for driving a Nail into <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Tempel, <hi>[Livy</hi> Book 7. chap. 3.] but a War falling out in the mean time, he would have manag'd that too, imperiously forcing the Youth to take Arms; which got him the Hatred of the Tribunes, and made <hi>Pomponius</hi> accuse him; about the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 393.</note> 
                  <hi>L. Manlius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aulus,</hi> who had been Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for holding that Office somewhat longer than he should have done. And amongst other things brought in this too against him, That he kept his Son <hi>Titus,</hi> who was afterwards <hi>Torquatus,</hi> from Conversation with the World, and had strictly charg'd him to live solitary in the Country. As soon as the Son heard his Father was in Trouble about this Business, he's reported immediately to have set out for <hi>Rome,</hi> and come early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pomponius</hi>'s House. <hi>Pomponius</hi> was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er told of his coming, but he got up immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and thinking the Youth, out of Anger, had brought some Complaint against his Father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all others to depart the Room, and him
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64327:170"/>
alone to be brought in to him.

The Conclusion of this Head.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt as <hi>Regulus</hi> did well in performing his Oath; so those ten, who, after the Battel at <hi>Cannae,</hi> were by <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent to the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, upon Oath of returning to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Camp, if they could not obtain an Exchange of Prisoners; did ill if they did not return accordingly: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom Writers have differ'd in their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <note n="a" place="bottom">An eminent Historian, Native of <hi>Achaia,</hi> and Son of one <hi>Lycortas,</hi> a Prince of that Country; but afterwards brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was admir'd for his Learning by all the Great Men, <hi>Scipio, Laelius,</hi> &amp;c. He wrote in Greek a History of the World, containing forty Books; most of which are now lost.</note> 
                  <hi>Polybius,</hi> an Author of very good Credit, informs us, Ten Persons of considerable Quality were sent to the Senate; and that nine of 'em ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly return'd to the Camp, not having been able to obtain what they went about; but the tenth staid behind and remain'd at <hi>Rome.</hi> This Man, as soon as he was out of the Camp, pretending he had forgot to take something along with him, went back thither again; as thinking his returning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a colour, was a very sufficient Performance of his Oath. But certainly he was mistaken; for Cunning's so far from excusing a Perjury, <note n="b" place="bottom">For all departure from the Simplicity of an Oath <hi>(they are the Words of a very great Man)</hi> is a Degree of Perjury; and a Man is never a whit the less Forsworn, because his Perjury is a little finer and more artificial than ordinary.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64327:171"/>
it aggravates it rather, and makes it the more crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. This therefore was no more than a foolish piece of Craftiness, impudently pretending to pass for Prudence: Whereupon the Senate took care to order, that my crafty Gentleman should be sent back in Fetters again to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousest Action of the Senate was this: <hi>Hannibal</hi> had <note n="c" place="bottom">After the Battel at <hi>Cannae,</hi> where <hi>Paullus</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi> the two Consuls were defeated by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>

The Senate decreed that these should not be Ransom'd, tho' it might have been done with a small Sum of Money; for no other end but to let our Soldiers see, that either they must resolve to Conquer, or Die. Upon the News of which, as the same Author tells us, <hi>Hannibal</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently began to be disheartned, when he saw that the Senate, and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> had so great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution even in the midst of their Misfortunes. Thus, we see, Honesty gets the better in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, against that which has only the Appearance of Profit. But <note n="d" place="bottom">A learned <hi>Roman,</hi> who was Quaestor and Tribune of the People.

               <p>WE have now finish'd our third Head, <note n="a" place="bottom">He has shewn that nothing can ever be Profitable, that's contrary to three of the general Virtues, <hi>Justice, Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Courage:</hi> It only remains that he shew the same of the fourth, <hi>Temperance;</hi> which he endeavours to do in this Chapter.</note> the fourth and last remains only to be spoke to, which contains in it Decency, Modesty, Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Continence and Temperance. And can any
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64327:172"/>
thing be Profitable, that is opposite to a Train of such excellent Virtues? There hath been however a Sect of Philosophers, Scholars of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> who were call'd <note n="b" place="bottom">Because <hi>Aristippus [chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Book</hi> 1.] was born at <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> a Town in <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Cyrenaicks;</hi> and others, who had the Name of <note n="c" place="bottom">So call'd from one <hi>Anniceris,</hi> a <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> Scholar of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raebates,</hi> a <hi>Cyrenaick.</hi> He corrected a little the <hi>Cyrenaick</hi> Opinions, and therefore was call'd Founder of a new Sect. See <hi>Menage</hi> on <hi>Laertius</hi>'s Life of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> where he shews there were two call'd <hi>Anniceris:</hi> the former Contemporary with <hi>Plato,</hi> and his Redeemer when a Slave in <hi>Aegina;</hi> and the latter of this Sect.</note> 
                  <hi>Annicerians</hi> given them, that affirm all Good to consist in Pleasure, and count Virtue it self <hi>therefore</hi> only desirable, because of some Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which it brings along with it. But these being now almost worn out of Date, <hi>Epicurus</hi> is mightily come into Vogue, the great Supporter, and, as 'twere, second Founder of the same Opinions. With these we must fight (as they say) with might and main, if ever we think of supporting the Cause, and maintaining the Interest of Virtue and Honesty. For if what <note n="d" place="bottom">An <hi>Athenian,</hi> Scholar and most intimate Friend to <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus;</hi> often mention'd by our Author.</note> 
                  <hi>Metrodorus</hi> has written pass for Truth, <hi>That whatever can truly be call'd our Profit, nay and all the Welfare and Happiness of Life, consists in a firm Constitution of Body, and a well-grounded Hope of its lasting Continuance;</hi> it is certain <hi>this Profit,</hi> nay <hi>this sovereign Profit</hi> (for such they account it) must sometimes be set in opposition to Honesty. <note n="e" place="bottom">He proceeds to shew, That this Opinion ruins all the Virtues; as first, <hi>Prudence.</hi>
                  </note> For what, in the first place, will be the Office of <hi>Prudence?</hi> only to cater and look about for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fures?
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64327:173"/>
How miserable a case is that Virtue in, which is thus made a Servant and Pander to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? But what shall be her Business in this Office? to tast and distinguish ingeniously betwixt Pleasures? Supposing this to be a pleasant Business, 'tis certainly the most scandalous one that could ever have been thought on. Again, Can he that makes Pain be the greatest Evil, have ever such a Virtue as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> in him, the very Nature of which consists wholly in despising of Pains and Difficulties? I know <hi>Epicurus</hi> upon several Occasions, and this in particular, speaks very couragiously as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Pain; but we must not consider so much what <hi>is</hi> said, as what <hi>ought to be said</hi> by a Man of his Principles, who makes Pleasure and Pain to be the ultimate Bounds of Man's Happiness and Misery. So again, if you'd hear him about <hi>Continence</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> he tells you abundance of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things in a great many places; but he's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd (as we speak) and can never be able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himself handsomly. For with what Face of Reason can he commend <hi>Temperance,</hi> who places his Happiness in the Enjoyment of Pleasures? <note n="f" place="bottom">That is Pleasure <hi>(Epicurus</hi>'s Happiness) consists in indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the sensual Appetite; but Temperance consists in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this Appetite; therefore Temperance and Pleasure can never agree; and consequently <hi>Epicurus</hi> is inconsistent with himself, when he commends Temperance, and yet makes Pleasure his soveraign Good.</note> when the sensual Appetite follows after Pleasures, and 'tis the Business of <hi>Temperance</hi> to correct that Appetite. <note n="g" place="bottom">Having prov'd that this Opinion ruins all the Virtues; he proceeds to shew, how these endeavour to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves off in each of them.</note> But still they endeavour, in each of these Virtues, to bring themselves off by one little Shift or other: Thus <hi>Prudence</hi> is admitted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:64327:173"/>
to be <hi>The Skill of supplying us with Pleasures, and defending us from Pains:</hi> And they make out <hi>Fortitude</hi> as well as they can, by saying it consists in despising Death and enduring Torments: They do bring in a sort of <hi>Temperance</hi> too, tho' not without a great deal of Straining and Difficulty; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they make a shift, after some fashion, by saying, they count it the greatest Pleasure, if they can but be exempt from Pain and Uneasiness. Thus these three Virtues stand up pretty well; but <hi>Justice,</hi> the fourth, totters mightily with them, or rather indeed is quite fal'n to the Ground; with all those Duties, which relate to the maintenance of Human Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See Note on Book</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.</note> For what Kindness, Liberality, Affability or Friendship can there be amongst those, who desire these Virtues not purely for themselves, but only in relation to their Pleasure or Advantage? To make short then, I shall only say, that as I have shewn before, That nothing can be Profitable which is contrary to Honesty; so now I do affirm, That Pleasure in general is contrary to Honesty. I the more blame therefore <note n="i" place="bottom">Two Philosophers often mention'd by our Author, who made Happiness consist in Pleasure and Honesty joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                  <hi>Dinomachus</hi> and <hi>Callipho,</hi> who thought this Dispute might be brought to an Issue, if they joyn'd both Pleasure and Virtue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, like a Man and a Beast as it were in the same Yoke. For Virtue can never admit of this Conjunction, but abhors and disdains it; nor can ever the soveraign Good and Evil, which must be one single and simple thing, be made up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of such different Principles. But of this, which is a thing of the greatest Moment, I have written at large in <note n="k" place="bottom">His Books <hi>De Finibus Bonorum &amp; Malorum.</hi>
                  </note> another Work: Let us now
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64327:174"/>
return to our present Subject: What has been said in this last Book, I hope, is enough to let any one see, How 'tis his Duty to determin his Choice, if that which seems useful and expedient for him, should come into competition with that which is Honest. But if it should be said, That even Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure carries with it the appearance of Profit; let it also be consider'd, That it never can be brought to an Agreement with Honesty: For the most that can possibly be said for Pleasure, (that we mayn't seem wholly to exclude it) is, That it serves by way of Sauce, to give a Relish to things, but has no true Profit or Advantage in it self.</p>
               <p>This is the Present, dear Son <hi>Mark,</hi> that your Father sends you, and in my Opinion 'tis a very good one; but that must be judg'd of according to the use you your self shall make of it.

Had it been my fortune to have come to <hi>Athens</hi> (<note n="l" place="bottom">He was on his way thither; but was sent home again by some who told him, That his Presence would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantagious to the Publick.
