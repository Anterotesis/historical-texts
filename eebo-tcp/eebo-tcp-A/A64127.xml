         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
INTRODUCTION
BEING
An Answer to the fourth Appendix to <hi>J. S.</hi> his Sure
Footing; intended against the General way of
procedure in the Dissuasive from Popery.</head>
            <p>WHen our Blessed Saviour was casting out
the evil spirit from the poor Daemoniac
in the Gospel, he asked his name; and
he answered, <hi>My name is legion, for we are many. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
is a <hi>Roman</hi> word, and signifies <hi>an Army,</hi> as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
signifies <hi>Catholic;</hi> that is, a great body of men which
though in true speaking they are but a part of an Imperial
Army, yet when they march alone, they can do mischief
enough, and call themselves an Army Royal. A Squadron
of this legion hath attempted to break a little Fort or
Outwork of mine, they came in the dark, their names
concealed, their qualities unknown, whether Clergy or
Laity not to me discovered, only there is one pert man
amongst them, one that is discovered by his <hi>sure footing.</hi>
The others I know not, but this man is a man famous in the
<hi>new science of controversie</hi> (as he is pleased to call it) I
mean in the most beauteous and amiable part of it, <hi>railing</hi>
and <hi>calumny;</hi> The man I mean is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
the man of principles, and the son of demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> H. H.</note>
and though he had so reviled a great Champion in
the <hi>Armies of the living God,</hi> that it was reasonable to


<pb facs="tcp:64671:5"/>
think he had cast forth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>all the fiery darts of the wicked one;</hi> yet I find that an
evil fountain is not soon drawn dry, and he hath indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enough and reviling left for others, amongst whom I
have the honour not to be the least sufferer and sharer in the
persecution. He thought not fit to take any further notice
of me but in an Appendix;<note place="margin">The fourth appendix to sure footing.</note> the Viper is but little, but it is
a Viper still, though it hath more tongue than teeth. I am
the more willing to quit my self of it, by way of introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because he intends it as an <hi>Organum Catholicum</hi>
against the General way of the procedure which I have
us'd in the Dissuasive; and therefore I suppose the removing
this, might <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> make my way smoother in
the following discourses.</p>
            <p>I will take no other notice of his evil language, his scorn
and reproach, his undervaluing and slighting the person
and book of the <hi>Dissuader,</hi> (as he is pleased sometimes to
call me) but I shall answer to these things as S. <hi>Bernard</hi>
did to the tempation of the Devil endeavouring to hinder
his preaching by tempting to vanity; <hi>I neither began for
you, nor for you will I make an end:</hi> but I shall look on
those Rhetorical flowers of his own but as a <hi>fermentum,</hi>
his spirit was troubled, and he <hi>breathed forth the froth as
of an enraged Sea;</hi> and when he hath done, it may be he
will be quiet, if not, let him know <hi>God will observe
that which is to come, and require that which is
past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will search and see what I can find of matter that
is to be considered, and give such accounts of them as is
necessary, and may be useful for the defence of my Book,
and the justification of my self against all ruder charges.
And after I have done so, I shall proceed to other <hi>things</hi>
which I shall esteem more useful.</p>
            <p>The first thing I shall take notice of, is his scornful and
slight speaking of Scripture, affirming that <hi>he is soonest
beaten at this weapon,</hi> that <hi>it is Sampsons hair;</hi> it is


<pb facs="tcp:64671:5"/>
the weakest part in the man: And yet if it be the weakest,
it is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the weakness and foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of preaching,</hi> more strong and more wise than all the
wisdom of man: When the Devil tempted our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
he us'd Scripture; but Christ did not reprove his way
of arguing, but in the same way discovered his fraud. <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est</hi> said the Tempter; yea, but <hi>scriptum est</hi> said
Christ, to other purposes than you intend; and so would
<hi>I. S.</hi> have proceeded if he had been at all in love with the
way. But he thinks he hath a better; and the wonder is
the less that the Gentleman does not love the Scriptures,
or at least gives too much suspicion that he does not; for he
hath not yet proved himself by his writings to be so good a
Christian as to love his enemies, or his reprovers: But
however he is pleased to put a scorn on Scripture expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it were much better if he and his Church too would
use them more, and express their articles they contend
for, and impose them on the Christian world in the words
and expressions of Scripture, which we are sure express
the minde of God with more truth and simplicity, than is
done by their words of art and expressions of the Schools.
If this had been observed, Christendom at this day had
had fewer controversies, and more truth, and more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

<hi>from it's very foundations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To perform this effect <hi>I. S.</hi> hath eight several mines,
all which I hope to discover without <hi>Guido Faux</hi> his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn.</p>

               <head>The First Way.</head>
               <p>HIS first Way is, That I have not one first or self evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
principle to begin with, on which I build the
Dissuasive; but he hath, that is, he says he hath; for he
hath reproved that oral tradition, on which he and his
Church relies, is such a principle; He thought (it may be)
he had reason then to say so; but the Scene is altered, and
until he hath sufficiently confuted his adversaries who have
proved his self evident principle to be an evident and
pitiful piece of Sophistry, his boasting is very vain. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
though he hath failed in his undertaking, yet I must
acquit my self as well as I can. I shall therefore tell him
that the truth, fulness, and sufficiency of Scripture in all
matters of faith and manners, is the principle that I and
all Protestants rely upon. And although this be not a first
and self-evident principle, yet it is resolved into these that
are. <hi>1. Whatsoever God hath said is true. 2. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
God hath done is good. 3. Whatsoever God
intends to bring to pass, he hath appointed means suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to that end.</hi> Now since God hath appointed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>to instruct us, and make us wise unto salvation,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:6"/>
and to make the man of God perfect,</hi> certain it is, that
this means must needs be sufficient to effect that end. Now
that God did do this, to this end, to them that believe the
Scriptures to be the Word of God, is as evident as any
first principle. And let these Scriptures be weighed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and see what they do amount to.<note place="margin">John. 5. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for therein ye think to have eternal life.</hi> The
<hi>Jews</hi> thought so, that is, they confessed and acknowledged
it to be so; and if they had been deceived in their thought,
besides that it is very probable Christ would have reprov'd
it, so it is very certain he would not have bidden them to
have used that means to that end. And if Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the Apostles did convince the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the
Scriptures of the old Testament, proving that Jesus was
the Christ: if Christ himself and the Apostles proved the
resurrection, and the passion, and the supreme Kingdom
of Christ out of the Scriptures, if the Apostle proved him
to be the Messias, and that be ought to suffer and to rise
again the third day by no other precedent topic, and that
upon these things Christian religion relied as upon it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
foundation, and on the other side the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors had
brought in many things by tradition, to which our Blessed
Saviour gave no countenance, but reproved many of them,
and made it plain that tradition was not the first and self
evident principle to rely upon in religion, but a way by which
they had corrupted the Commandment of God: It will follow
from hence, that the Scriptures are the way that Christ
and his Apostles walked in, and that oral tradition was
not. But then to this add what more concerns the <hi>N. T.</hi>
when <hi>S. Luke</hi> wrote his Gospel, in the preface he tells us,
<hi>That many had taken in hand to set forth in order a
declaration of those things, which are most surely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
amongst us</hi> [Christians,] and that <hi>he having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
understanding of all things</hi> (viz. which Christ did
and taught) <hi>from the very first</hi> did write [this Gospel]
that <hi>Theophilus might know the certainty of those


<pb facs="tcp:64671:7"/>
things in which he had been instructed:</hi> Now here (if
we believe <hi>S. Luke)</hi> was no want of any thing; he was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instructed in all things; and he chose to write that book,
that by that book <hi>Theophilus</hi> might know the truth, yea,
the certainty of all things. Now if we be Christians and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
<hi>S. Luke</hi> to be divinely inspired, this is not indeed a
<hi>first</hi> but <hi>an evident principle;</hi> that a book of Scripture
can make a man certain and instructed in the whole Gospel
of Jesus Christ. To the same purpose is that of <hi>S. John
These things are written, that ye might believe that
Jesus is the Christ the Son of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John. 20. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>and that believing
ye might have life through his name.</hi> The end is salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Jesus Christ; the means of effecting this, was this
writing the Gospel by <hi>S. John;</hi> and therefore it is a sure
principle for Christians to rely upon, the word of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by men divinely inspired, such as Christians believe
and confess <hi>S. Luke</hi> and <hi>S. John</hi> to be. Hear <hi>S. Luke</hi>
again,<note place="margin">Acts 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The former treatise have I made O Theophilus
of all that Jesus began both to do and teach untill the
day he was taken up.</hi> No man then can deny but all
Christs doctrine and life was fully set down by these Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
and Apostles; whether it were to any purpose or no,
let <hi>I. S.</hi> consider, and I shall consider with him in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.
But first let us hear what <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
written as it is probable not long before his death; but
certainly after three of the Gospels, and divers of the
Epistles were written, and consequently related to the
Scriptures of the old and new Testament. <hi>[Continue thou
in the things which thou hast learned and hast been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 5. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>knowing of whom thou hast learned them:
And that from a child thou hast known the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation,
through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in righteousness, that the man of God may be


<pb facs="tcp:64671:7"/>
perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.]</hi>
Now I demand; Does <hi>I. S.</hi> believe these words to be true?
Are the Scriptures able to make us wise unto salvation?
Are they profitable to all intents and purposes of the spirit,
that is, to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct? Is the
end of all this Oeconomy, to make a <hi>Christian man,</hi> yea
a <hi>Christian Bishop</hi> perfect? Can he by this dispensation be
throughly furnished unto all good works, and that <hi>by faith
in Jesus Christ?</hi> If so, then this is the true principle, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
way, the way of God, the way of salvation: And
if Scriptures, [the books written by the finger of God, and
the pen of Apostles] can do all this, then they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than <hi>Inke varied into divers figures, unsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
characters,</hi> and I know not what other reviling Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets
<hi>I.</hi> S. is pleased to cast upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, but all this is nothing, unless we know that
Scriptures are the word of God, that they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Apostles; and of this, the Scriptures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a witness in their own behalf: And therefore
oral tradition must supply that, and consequently is
the only first and self-evident principle.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
that it matters not by what means it be conveyed
to us that the Scriptures are the Word of God. Oral
tradition is an excellent means; but it is not that alone by
which it is conveyed. For if by oral tradition he means
the testimony of the Catholick Church; it is the best exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ministery of conveyance of this, being a matter of
fact, and of so great concernment. To which the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our adversaries <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> adds no small
moment; and the tradition is also conveyed to us by very
many writings. But when it is thus conveyed, and that
the Church does believe them to be the Word of God, then
it is that I inquire, whether the Scriptures cannot be a
witness to us of it's own design, fulness, and perfection.
Certainly no principle is more evident than this, none more
sure and none before it; <hi>Whatever God hath said is


<pb facs="tcp:64671:8"/>
true,</hi> and in Scripture God did speak, and speak this;
and therefore this to us is a <hi>first,</hi> at least <hi>an evident prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, but if this proposition, <hi>that the Scriptures are
the Word of God,</hi> is conveyed to us by oral tradition,
this must needs be the best and only principle; for if it
be trusted for the whole, why not for every particular. This
Argument concludes thus. This is the gate of the House,
therefore this is all the house. Every man enters this
way; and therefore this is the Hall and the Cellar, the
Pantry and Dining room, the Bedchambers and the
Cocklofts. But besides the ridiculousness of the argument,
there is a particular reason why the argument cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude:
The reason in brief is this, because it is much easier
for any man to carry a letter, than to tell the particular er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand;
It is easier to tell one thing, than to tell ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
to deliver one thing out of our hand, than a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
out of our mouths; one matter of fact, than very
many propositions; as it is easier to convey in writing all
<hi>Tullies</hi> works, than to say by heart with truth and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
any one of his Orations. That the Bible was written
by inspired men, God setting his seal to their doctrine,
confirming by miracles what they first preached, and then
wrote in a book, this is a matter of fact, and is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be prov'd (unless God should proceed extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and by miracle) but by the testimony of wise men, who
saw it with their eyes, and heard it with their ears, and
felt it with their hands. This was done at first, then only
consign'd, then witnessed, and thence delivered. And
with how great success, and with the blessing of how migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a providence, appears it in this; because although as
<hi>S. Luke</hi> tells us, many did undertake to write Gospels, or the
declaration of the things so surely believ'd amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
and we find in <hi>S. Clement</hi> of <hi>Alex. Origen, S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
Athanasius, Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>S. Hierom</hi> mention
made of many Gospels, as that of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:8"/>
Nazarenes, Ebionites,</hi> the Gospel of <hi>James, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,
Bartholomew, Thomas</hi> and divers more, yet but
four only were transmitted and consigned to the Church;
because these four only were written by these whose names
they bear; and these men had the testimony of God, and
a spirit of truth, and the promise of Christ, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
should bring all things to their minds, and he did so:
Now of this we could have no other testimony but of those
who were present, who stop'd the first issue of the false Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,
and the sound of the other four went forth into all
the world, according to that of <hi>Origen, Ecclesia cum
quatuor tantum Evangelii libros habet, per universum
mundum Evangeliis redundat; heresies cum multa
habeant, unum non habent.</hi> Those which heretics made
are all lost, or slighted, those which the spirit of God did
write by the hands of men divinely inspired, these abide,
and shall abide for ever. Now then this matter of fact
how should we know, but by being told it by credible persons
who could know, and never gave cause of suspicion that
they should deceive us. Now if <hi>I. S.</hi> will be pleas'd to call
this Oral tradition, he may; but that which was deliver'd
by this Oral tradition was not only preach'd at first, but
transmitted to us by many writings, besides the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
both of friends and enemies. But suppose it were
not; yet this book of Scriptures might be consigned by
Oral tradition from the Apostles and Apostolic men, and
yet tradition become of little or no use after this consigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and delivery. For this was all the work which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
was to be done by it; and indeed this was all that it
could do well.</p>
               <p>1. This was all which was necessary to be done by Oral
tradition; because the wisdom of the divine spirit having
resolved to write all the doctrine of salvation in a book,
and having done it well and sufficiently in order to his own
gracious purposes, (for who dares so much as suspect the
contrary) there was now no need that Oral tradition should


<pb facs="tcp:64671:9"/>
be kept up with the joynture of infallibility, since the first
infallibility of the Apostles was so sufficiently witnessed,
that it convinced the whole world of Christians; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was enough to consign the Divinity and perfection of
this book for ever. For it was in this as in the doctrine it
self contain'd in the Scriptures, God <hi>confirmed it by signs
following;</hi> that is by signs proving that the Apostles
spake the minde of God, the things which they speak were
prov'd and believ'd for ever; but then the signs went away,
and left a permanent and eternal event. So it is in the
infallible tradition delivered by the Apostles and Apostolic
age, concerning the Scriptures being the word of God;
what they said was confirm'd by all that testimony, by
which they obtained belief in the Church, to their persons
and doctrines; but when they had once deliver'd this, there
needed no remaining miracle, and intail of infallibility
in the Church, to go on in the delivery of this; for by that
time that all the Apostles were dead, and the infallible
spirit was departed, the Scriptures of the Gospels were
believed in all the world, and then it was not ordinarily
possible ever any more to detract faith from that book;
and then for the transmitting this book to after ages, the
Divine providence needed no other course, but the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
ways of man, that is, right reason, common faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the interest of souls, believing a good thing, which there
was and could be no cause to disbelieve; and an Uniuersal
consent of all men, that were any ways concern'd for it, or
against it, and this not only preach'd upon the house tops,
but set down also in very many writings. This actually
was the way of transmitting this book, and the authority of
it, to after ages respectively.</p>
               <p>These things are of themselves evident, yet because
<hi>I. S.</hi> still demands we should set down some first and self
evident principle, on which to found the whole procedure,
I shall once more satisfie him; And this is a first and self
evident principle, <hi>whatsoever can be spoken can be


<pb facs="tcp:64671:9"/>
written;</hi> and if it he plain spoken, it may be as plain
written. I hope I need not go about to demonstrate this;
for it is of it self evident, that God can write all that he
is pleased to speak; and all good scribes can set down in
writing whatsoever another tells them; and in his very
words too if he please, he can as well transcribe a word
spoken, as a word written. And upon this principle it is, that
the Protestants believe that the words of Scripture can be
as easily understood after they are written in a book, as when
they were spoken in the Churches of the first Christians;
and the Apostles and Evangelists did write the life of
Christ, his doctrines, the doctrines of faith, as plain as
they did speak them, at least as plain as was necessary to
the end for which they were written, which is the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our souls. And what necessity now can there be, that
there should be a perpetual miracle still current in the
Church, and a spirit of infallibility descendant to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Church of all those things, which are at once set
down in a book, the truth and authority of which was at
first prov'd by infallible testimony, the memory and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of which is preserved amongst Christians by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unquestionable records, and testimonies of several
natures.</p>
               <p>2. As there was no necessity that an infallible Oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
should do any more but consign the books of Scripture;
so it could not do any more, without a continual miracle.
That there was no continued miracle is sufficiently prov'd,
by proving it was not necessary it should; for that also is
another first and self-evident principle, that <hi>the All wise
God does not do any thing, much less such things as
miracles, to no purpose, and for no need.</hi> But now if
there be not a continued miracle, then Oral tradition was
not fit to be trusted, in relating the particulars of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion. For if in a succession of Bishops and Priests
from <hi>S. Peter</hi> down to <hi>P. Alexander</hi> the seventh, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any man to be assured that there was no nullity


<pb facs="tcp:64671:10"/>
in the ordinations, but insensibly there might intervene
something to make a breach in the long line, which must in
that case be made up as well as they can, by tying a knot on
it: It will be infinitely more hard to suppose, but that in the
series and successive talkings of the Christian religion, there
must needs be infinite variety, and many things told other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and somethings spoken with evil purposes, by such as
<hi>preach'd Christ out of envy;</hi> and many odd things said,
and doctrines strangely represented by such as <hi>creep into
houses, and lead captive silly women:</hi> It may be the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the Apostolical Churches did preach right doctrines
for divers ages; but yet in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where fifteen Bishops
in succession were circumcis'd, who can tell how many
things might be spoken in justification of that practice,
which might secretly undervalue the Apostolical doctrine.
And where was the Oral tradition then of this proposition;
<hi>If ye be circumcis'd Christ shall profit you nothing.</hi>
But however, though the Bishops did preach all the doctrine
of Christ; yet these Sermons were told to them that were
absent, by others who it may be might mistake something,
and understand them to other senses than was intended.
And though infallibility of testifying might be given to the
Church, that is, to the chief Rulers of it, (for I hope
<hi>I. S.</hi> does not suppose it subjected in every single Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
man or woman) yet when this testimony of theirs is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
abroad, the reporters are not always infallible: And
let it be considered, that even now since Christianity hath
been transmitted so many ages, and there are so many
thousands that teach it, yet how many hundreds of these
thousands understand but very little of it, and therefore
tell it to others but pitifully and imperfectly; so that if
God in his Goodness had not preserv'd to us <hi>the surer
word</hi> of the prophetical and Evangelical Scriptures, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
would by this time have been a most strange
thing, <hi>litera scripta manet.</hi> As to the Apostles while
they lived it was so easie to have recourse, that error


<pb facs="tcp:64671:10"/>
durst not appear with an open face, but the cure was at
hand: so have the Apostles when they took care to leave
something left to the Churches to put them in minde of the
precious doctrine; they put a sure standard, and fixt a
rule in the Church, to which all doubts might be brought to
trial, and against which all heresies might be dashed in
pieces. But we have liv'd to see the Apostolical Churches
rent from one another, and teaching contrary things, and
pretending contrary traditions, and abounding in several
senses, and excommunicating one another; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
(for example) that we should see the <hi>Greeks</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any whither, but to their own superiour and their own
Churches to be taught Christian Religion; and the <hi>Latins</hi>
did always go to their own Patriarch, and to their own
Bishops and Churches, and it is not likely it should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
now, than it hath been hitherto, that is, that they
follow the religion that is taught them there, and the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that is delivered by their immediate superiours.
Now there being so vast a difference, not only in the Great
Churches, but in several ages, and in several Dioceses,
and in single Priests, every one understanding as he can, and
speaking as he please, and remembring as he may, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it accordingly, and the people also understanding
it by halves, and telling it to their Children, sometimes ill,
sometimes not at all, and seldom as they should; and they
who are taught, neglecting it too grosely, and attending to
it very carelesly, and forgeting it too quickly; and which
is worse yet, men expounding it according to their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
or their lusts, out of faction, or as they are mislead,
and then report it accordingly: These and a thousand
things more, convince us of the easiness of being deceived
by Oral tradition of doctrines, which can insensibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
be chang'd in great differences and mistakes;
but can never suffer any considering Person to believe, that
mouth delivery is a better way of keeping records than
writing in a book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:11"/>
So that now I wonder that <hi>I. S.</hi> is pleas'd to call tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
certainty, the <hi>first principle of controversie;</hi> the
pretence of it is indeed the mother and nurse of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
for in the world there is not any thing more uncertain
than the report of mens words. How many men have been
undone by mistaken words? And it is well remembred that
in the last unhappy Parliament, a Gentleman was called
to the Bar for speaking words of truth and honesty,<note place="margin">1641.</note> but
against the sense of the House: The words were spoken in a
great assembly, before many witnesses; curious and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
observers spoken at that very time; and yet when the
words were questioned, they could not agree what they
were; and consequently the sense of them might be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
altered, since a word, the misplacing of a word, an
accent, a point, any ambiguity, any mistake might change
the sense; well upon this accident the Speaker call'd to a
Gentleman whom he had observed to write the words;
and to him they appealed, and he told them that which I
supposed was said, but wholly differing from them that
speak it, the traditionary part of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>All the rest which <hi>I. S.</hi> says in his first Way, is nothing
but a strange and arrogant bragging, which as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the modesty of a Christian, so it is an ill
sign of a sober and wise conviction; for if he had demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
the certainty of Oral tradition, he needed no such
noises; they that speak truest, make the least stir, and
when they are at peace in the truth of the thing, they are
pleas'd it is well, and so they leave it to prevail by it's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
strengths.</p>
               <p>But after all this noise made by <hi>I. S.</hi> why is he so fierce
to call me to first and self evident principles? Does any
school of Philosophy do so in their Systems and discourses?
Are there not in every Science divers <hi>praecognita,</hi> things
to be presupposed and believ'd before we can prove any
thing? Is it reasonable when I reprove any vitious person
for dishonouring God, and dissuade him from his wicked


<pb facs="tcp:64671:11"/>
courses, that he should tell me he will not be dissuaded by
my fine words, but if I will go to principles and first
grounds, he will hear me; and I must first prove what <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring</hi>
is, and <hi>how God can be dishonoured,</hi> and
whether it be only <hi>by fiction of law,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and by
way of condescension it is so said; and yet after all this,
I must prove that <hi>God does care at all whether the Man
say such things or no,</hi> or lastly I must prove that <hi>there is
a God,</hi> before he can suffer me to reprove him upon such
ungrounded discourses. Theology, and the Science of the
Scriptures supposes divers grounds laid down before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd;
and therefore it were a wild demand, that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
book we should make a Logical systeme, or a formal ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysts
of all our discourses, and make a map describing all
the whole <hi>passage</hi> from the first truth, to the present affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>I. S.</hi> will but consider what the Design of the
Dissuasive was, and that the purpose of it was to prove,
that the doctrine of Popery as such, is wholly an Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
neither Catholic, nor Apostolic; there was no need of
coming to any other first grounds, but to shew the time
when the <hi>Roman</hi> propositions were not Catholic doctrines,
and when they began to be esteemed so. These things are
matters of fact, and need no reduction to any other first
principles, but the credible testimony of men fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
But yet because I will humor. <hi>I. S.</hi> for this once;
even here also the Dissuasive relies upon a first and self evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
principle as any is in Christianity; and that is, <hi>Quod
primum verum.</hi> And therefore if I prove that the <hi>Roman</hi>
doctrines now controverted were not at first, but came in
afterwards, then I have built the Dissuasive aright; and
now <hi>I have pointed it out,</hi> and have already in part, and
in the following book have more largely done it; therefore
I hope <hi>I.</hi> S. will be as good as his word and <hi>yield himself
absolutely confuted.</hi> But because there are some other
reasons inclining me to think he will not perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:12"/>
and particularly <hi>because of the ill naturedness of</hi>
[his own] <hi>principles,</hi> (that I may use his own expression in
in his <hi>postscript)</hi> yet if I have fail'd in my proofs, it is
not for want of clear and evident principles, but of right
deductions from them; and therefore he is mistaken in his
first way of mining, and whether there be any defect in any
thing else, will be put to trial in the sequel; In the mean
time, the Lion is not so terrible as he is painted.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="way">
               <head>The second Way.</head>
               <p>IN the next place I shall try his second mine; and believe
I shall finde it big with a <hi>brutum fulmen,</hi> and that it
can do no hurt but make a noise, and scare the boys in the
neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>For now though in the first way he blam'd me for relying
upon no first and self evident principle; in the second he
excludes me from all right of using any, unless I will take
his. He says, <hi>I have no right to alledge Scriptures or
Fathers, Councils, or reason, history or instances.</hi>
But why, I pray? <hi>Tis done thus: All discourse supposes
that certain upon which it builds.</hi> That is his first
proposition; what he makes of it afterwards we shall see;
In the mean time, he may consider that though all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
suppose that certain on which they build, because
his Geese are Swans, and his arguments are demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet there are many wiser discourses which rely upon
probable arguments: And so does a moral demonstration;
and such a great wit of <hi>France,</hi> Mr. <hi>Silhon</hi> supposed
to be his best way of proving <hi>the immortality of the soul.</hi>
Now this is nothing but a coacervation of many probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which according to the subject matter (as not being
capable of any other way of probation) amounts to the effect
of a demonstration. And however this Gentleman looks
big upon it, the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is by
the wisest of his own party acknowledged to rely but upon


<pb facs="tcp:64671:12"/>
prudential motives; and he is a mad man says <hi>Artistotle,</hi>
who in some cases (in which yet a man may discourse wisely
enough) looks for any more than arguments of a high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.
But what does <hi>I. S.</hi> think of arguments <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem?</hi>
do they suppose that certain which they build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
or if they do not, can there be no good discourses made
upon them? what are the wise consultations of States and
Councils? do they always discourse foolishly when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
and argue, but upon probabilities? Nay what does
<hi>I. S.</hi> think of General Councils who are fallible in their
premisses though right in their Conclusions? do their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
suppose their premisses, upon which they build
their conclusions to be certain? If not, then <hi>I. S.</hi> hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
weakly, that all discourse supposes that certain upon
which it builds.</p>
               <p>Well! but how does he build upon this rotten foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who hath already in this very procedure confuted his
following discourse, as being such which does not, I am sure
ought not (as appears by the reasons I have brought against
it) suppose that certain on which it is built: <hi>Thus, if
tradition or the way of conveying down matters of
fact by the former ages testifying can fail, none of
these</hi> (viz. <hi>Scripture, reason, history, Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
yea <hi>instances) are certain.</hi> This is his assumption;
and this besides that it is false, is also to none of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
1. It is false, For suppose tradition be not certain,
how must <hi>all reason</hi> therefore fail? for first there must be
some reason presupposed, before the certainty of tradition
can be established; and if there be not, why does <hi>I. S.</hi> offer
at a demonstrative reason to prove the certainty of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
(though if there be no better reasons for it, than he
hath yet shown, his reason and tradition fail together)
2. Supposing tradition should fail, yet there may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
given for the excellency of Christianity, which as they
confirm Christians in their faith, and beget love to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:13"/>
so they may be sufficient to invite even the wiser hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
to consider it, and choose it.</p>
               <p>But then suppose that these things should be uncertain
upon the supposal of the uncertainty of tradition of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of fact, yet it will avail <hi>I. S.</hi> nothing; for it will
only follow that then <hi>those things which only rely upon
that matter of fact</hi> are not demonstratively certain; but
though it may fail <hi>in some things,</hi> it may be <hi>right in
others,</hi> and we may have reason for one, and not for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and then either those things must be proved some
other way, or else they can be believed but only so far as
the first topic will extend; which yet though so uncertain
as not to be infallible or demonstrative, may be certain
enough to make men believe, and live and dye accordingly.
For if we have no better, God requires no better, and by
these things will bring his purposes to pass; and if this
were not true what will become of the Laity, and many the
ignorant Priests of his own Church, who do not rely upon
the certainty of Universal tradition, but the single testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their Parents or their Parish Priest? But of this
afterwards.</p>
               <p>But to come closer to the thing? suppose tradition of fact
be certain (for so it is in many instances, and if it be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
it will be allowed to be so in all) yet it is but so
certain, that yet there is a natural possibility that it should
be false; and it is possible that what the Generality of one
sort of men do joyntly testifie, may yet be found false, or
at least uncertain; as the burial of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in <hi>Mecha,</hi>
and his being attracted by a Loadstone, of which the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans</hi>
have a long and general tradition, at least we
in Christendom are made to believe so; and if it be not so,
yet it is naturally possible that they should all believe and
teach a lie, and they actually do so; yet I will allow Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Catholic tradition speaking morally to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and indubitable; and that if this should fail, much
of our comfort and certainty of adherence to Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion


<pb facs="tcp:64671:13"/>
would fail with it; but then it is to be considered,
that the certainty of tradition which is allowed, is but
<hi>in matters of fact, not in doctrines,</hi> because the fact
may be one, the doctrines many; that soon remembred,
these soon forgotten; that perceived by sense, these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
and misunderstood; And though it is very credibly
reported and easily believed that <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> was kill'd
in the Senate, yet all that he said that day, and all the
unwritten orders he made, and all his orations will not,
cannot so easily be trusted upon Oral tradition. So that
Oral tradition is a good ministery of <hi>conveying a record,</hi>
but is <hi>not the best record;</hi> and the principle office of Oral
tradition is done when the record is verified by it, when the
Scripture is consign'd; and though still it is useful, yet it is
not still so necessary: For when by tradition or Oral testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
we are assur'd that the Bible is the word of God, and
the great record of salvation, then we are sure that God
who gave it, will preserve it, or not require it, and he
that design'd it to such an end, will make and keep it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to that end, and that he hath done so already is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
notorious, because God hath been pleased to multiply
the copies, and enwrap the contents of that book with the
biggest interests of mankind; that it is made impossible to
destroy that divine repository of necessary and holy doctrines;
And when the Christians were by deaths and tortures assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to cause them to deliver up their Bibles, that they might
be destroyed, the persecutors prevailed not; they might
with as much success have undertaken to drink up the sea.
And that providence which keeps the whole from destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will also keep all it's necessary parts from corruption, lest
the work of God become insufficient to the end of it's desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
And he that will look for better security, than
we can have from the certain knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the infallibility of the Divine providence and
never failing goodness, must erect a new office of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:14"/>
The effect of this discourse is this; that Oral tradition
may be very certain, and in some case, is the best evidence
we have in matters of fact, unless where we are taught by
sense or revelation, and if it were not certain, we should be
infinitely to seek for notices of things that are past; but
this is but a moral certainty, though it be the best we have;
and this is but in matters of fact, not in doctrines and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or notions delivered in many words; and after all this,
when tradition hath consign'd an instrument or record, a
writing or a book, it may then leave being necessary, and
when the providence of God undertakes to supply the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of man, the change is for our advantage.</p>
               <p>Well! now having considered this second proposition, let
us see what his Conclusion is; for that also hath something
of particular consideration, as having in it something more
than was in the premisses. The Conclusion is this. <hi>[There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Protestant or a renouncer of tradition cannot
with reason pretend to discourse out of any of these]</hi>
To which I shall reply these things. 1. This Gentleman
wholly mistakes us Protestants, as he did the Protestant
Religion when he weakly forsook it. Protestants are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncers
of tradition; for we allow all Catholic traditions
that can prove themselves to be such; but we finding little
or nothing (excepting this, that <hi>the Bible is the word of
God,</hi> and that <hi>the Bible contains all the will of God
for our salvation,</hi> all doctrines of faith and life) little or
nothing else, I say, descending to us by an Universal tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore we have reason to adhere to Scripture, and
renounce (as <hi>I. S.</hi> is pleased to call it) all pretence of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of any matters of faith not plainly set down in the
Bible.</p>
               <p>But now since we renounce no tradition but such as is
not and cannot be prov'd to be competent and Catholic, I
hope with the leave of <hi>I. S.</hi> we may discourse out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Councils, Fathers and reason, history and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
For we believe tradition when it is credible,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:14"/>
and we believe what two or three honest men say upon their
knowledge, and we make no scruple to believe that there
is an <hi>English</hi> Plantation in the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> because many
tell us so, who have no reason to deceive us; so that we are
in a very good capacity of making use of Scriptures and
Councils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I must deal freely with Mr. S. though we
do believe these things upon credible testimony, yet we do
not think the testimony infallible, and we do believe
many men who yet pretend not to infallibility: And
if nothing were <hi>Credible</hi> but what is <hi>infallible,</hi> then
no man had reason to believe his Priest or his Father: We
are taught by <hi>Aristotle</hi> that that is credible, <hi>Quod pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,
quod sapientibus, quod omnibus videtur;</hi> and yet
these are but degrees of probability, and yet are sufficient
to warrant the transaction of all humane affairs, which
(unless where God is pleased to interpose) are not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of greater assurance. Even the miracles wrought by our
Blessed Saviour though they were the best arguments in the
world to prove the Divinity of his person and his mission,
yet they were but the best argument we needed and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
but although they were infinitely sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
all but the malicious, yet there were some so malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
who did not allow them to be demonstrations, but said,
that he did <hi>cast out Devils by Beelzebub. Here we
live by faith and not by knowledge,</hi> and therefore it is an
infinite goodness of God to give proofs sufficient for us, and
fitted to our natures, and proportion'd to our understanding;
but yet such as may neither extinguish faith, nor destroy
the nature of hope, which although it may be so certain
and sure as to be a stedfast <hi>anchor of the soul,</hi> yet it may
have in it something of Natural uncertainty; and yet
<hi>fill us with all comfort and hope in believing:</hi> So that
we allow tradition to be certain if it be universal, and
to be credible according to the degrees of its Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and disinterested simplicity; and therefore we have as
much right to use the Scriptures and Fathers as <hi>I. S.</hi> and


<pb facs="tcp:64671:15"/>
all his party: and all his following talk in the sequel of this
second way, relying upon a ground which I have discovered
to be false, must needs fall of it self, and signifie nothing.
But although this point be soon washt off, yet I suppose the
charge which will recoyle upon himself will not so easily be
put by. For though it appears that Protestants have right to
use Fathers and Councils, Scriptures and reason, yet <hi>I. S.</hi> and
his little convention of four or five <hi>Brothers of the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
have clearly disintitled themselves to any use of these.
For if the oral tradition of the present Church be the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
and only rule of faith, then there is no Oracle but this
one; and the decrees of Councils did bind only in that age
they were made, as being part of the tradition of that
age; but the next age needed it not, as giving testimony
to it self, and being it's own rule. And therefore when a
question is to be disputed, you can go no whither to be tried
but to the tradition of the present Church, and this is not
to be proved by a series and order of records and succession;
but if you will know what was formerly believed, you must
only ask, what is believed now; for now rivers run back to
their springs, and the Lamb was to blame for troubling the
Wolf by drinking in the descending river, for the lower is
now higher, and you are not to prove by what is past, that the
present is right, but by the present you prove what was past,
and <hi>Harry</hi> the seventh is before <hi>Harry</hi> the sixth, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
must teach their Parents, and therefore it is to be
hop'd in time may be their Elders. But by this means,
Fathers and Councils are made of no use to these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who have greatly obliged the world by telling us a
short way to Science; and though our life be short, yet art
is shorter, especially in our way, in Theology; Concerning
which there needs no labour, no study, no reading, but to
know of the present Church what was always believed, and
taught, and what ought to be so; Nay what was done, or
what was said, or what was written is to be told by the
present Church, which without further trouble can infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly


<pb facs="tcp:64671:15"/>
assure us. And upon this account the Jesuits have
got the better of the <hi>Jansenists;</hi> for though these men weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fondly deny such words to be in <hi>Jansenius,</hi> yet the
virtual Church can tell better, whether they be or no in
<hi>Jansenius,</hi> or rather it matters not whether they be or no;
for it being the present sense of the Pope, he may proceed to
condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> I. S. <hi>offers at some reason for this:</hi> For <hi>(saith he)</hi>
Fathers being eminent witnesses to immediate posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or children of the Churches doctrine received, and
Councils representatives of the Church; their
strengths as proofs, nay their very existence is not
known till the notion of the Church be known, which
is part of their definition, and to which they relate.
<hi>This is but part of his argument, which I yet must consider
apart, because every proposition of his argument hath in it
something very untrue; which when I have remark'd I shall
consider the whole of it altogether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here first I consider that it is a strange proposition
to say that <hi>the existence of the Fathers is not known
till the notion or definition of the Church be known.</hi>
For who is there of any knowledge in any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that hath not heard of <hi>S. Austin, S. Jerom, S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
or <hi>S. Gregory.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a proverb,
<hi>There was never good Oglio without Bacon, nor good
Sermon without S. Austin;</hi> and yet I suppose all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Spain</hi> that hear the name of <hi>S. Austin</hi> it may be five
hundred times every Lent, make no question of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of <hi>S. Austin,</hi> or that there was such a man as he;
and yet I believe, not very many of them can tell the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church. Thousands of the people and the very
boys see the pictures of <hi>S. Austin</hi> sold in Fairs and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and yet are not so wise as to know the notion or nature
of the Church; and indeed many wiser people both among
them and us will be very much to seek in the definition,
when your learned men amongst your selves dispute what
that nature or definition is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:16"/>
But it may be though <hi>I. S.</hi> put Fathers and Councils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same proposition, yet he means it of Councils only,
and that it is the existence of Councils which is not to be
had without the notion or definition of Church, and this is
as false as the other; for what tradesman in <hi>Germany,
Italy, France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> is not well enough assur'd that there
was such a thing as the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and yet to the
knowing of this, it was not necessary that they should be told
how <hi>Church</hi> is to be defin'd. Indeed they can not know what
it is to be <hi>Church-Councils,</hi> unless they know as much of
<hi>Church</hi> as they do of <hi>Councils.</hi> But what think we?
Could not men know there was a Council at <hi>Ariminum</hi>
more numerous than that at <hi>Nice,</hi> unless they had the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Church? Certainly the Church was no part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of that Council, nor did it relate, save only as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are relatives to each other; and if they be, yet it is
hard to say they are parts of each others definition. But it
may be <hi>I. S.</hi> means this saying of good and Catholic Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;
yet they also may be known <hi>to have been,</hi> without
skill in definitions. Definitions do not tell <hi>An sit,</hi> but
<hi>quid sit;</hi> the first is to be supposed before any definition is
to be inquir'd after.</p>
               <p>Well! but how shall the being or nature of Church be
known? that's his second proposition, and tells us a pretty
thing, <hi>[Nor is the being or nature of Church known
till it be certainly known who are faithful or have true
faith, who not; which must be manifested by their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or not having the true Rule of faith.]</hi> Why, but does
the having the true rule of faith make a man faithful?
Cannot a man have the true rule of faith, and yet forsake
it, or not make use of it, or <hi>hide the truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness?</hi>
Does the having the best antidote in the world
make a man healthful, though he live disorderly, and make
no use of it? But to let that pass among the other <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
That which is more remarkable, is, <hi>That the being or
Nature of Church is not known, till it be certainly


<pb facs="tcp:64671:16"/>
known who are faithful or have true faith.</hi> I had thought
that the way in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of pronouncing men
faithful, or to have true faith, had been their being in the
Church, and that adhering to the Church (whose being and
truth they must therefore be presupposed to believe) had
been the only way of pronouncing them faithful; which I
suppos'd so certain amongst them, that though they have
no faith at all, but to believe as the Church believes, had
been a sufficient declaration of the faith of ignorant men.
But it seems the Tables are turned. It is not enough to go
to the Church; but first they must be assured that they are
faithful and have true faith, before they know any thing of
the Church.</p>
               <p>But if the testimony of the present Church be the only
rule of faith (as <hi>I. S.</hi> would fain make us believe) then it
had been truer said; a man can not know the being or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>of faith,</hi> till he be well acquainted <hi>with the Church.</hi>
And must the Rule of faith be tried by the Church, and
must the Church be tried by the rule of faith? Is the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church the measure and touchstone of faith,
and yet must we have the faith before we have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whether there be a Church or no? Are they both first,
and both prove one another, and is there here no circle?
But however I am glad that the evidence of truth hath
brought this Gentleman to acknowledge that our way
is the better way; and that we must first chuse our religion
and then our Church; and not first chuse our Church, and
then blindly follow the religion of it whatsoever it be. But
then also it will follow that <hi>I. S.</hi> hath destroyed his main
<hi>hypothesis,</hi> and the oral tradition of the present Church
is not <hi>the Rule of faith;</hi> for that must first be known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can know whether there be such a thing as the
Church or no; whose rule that is pretended to be.</p>
               <p>And now follows his conclusion, which is nought upon
other accounts; <hi>[Wherefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the Rule of Faith do all agree to Tradition


<pb facs="tcp:64671:17"/>
our Rule, and none of them to theirs, it follows the
Protestant or Renouncer of Tradition knows not what
is either right Scripture, Father or Council, and so
ought not to meddle with either of them.]</hi> To this I
have already answered, and what <hi>I. S.</hi> may do hereafter
when he happens to fall into another fit of demonstration I
know not, but as yet he hath been very far from doing what
he says he hath done, that is, <hi>evidently prov'd what</hi> he
undertook in this question. And I suppose I have in a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Section of this book evidently prov'd that <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
such I mean as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uses in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
leads into error or may do, as often as into truth;
and therefore though we may and do use tradition as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
argument in many things, and some as certain in one
or two things to which in the nature of the thing it is apt to
minister, yet it is infinitely far from being the rule of faith,
the whole Christian faith.</p>
               <p>But I wonder why <hi>I. S.</hi> saith that for want of Tradition,
we cannot know either right Scripture, Fathers or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.
I do not think that by tradition they do know all the
books of Scriptures. Do they know by Universal or Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Tradition that the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Scripture? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had no tradition for
it for above four hundred years, and they receiv'd it at
last from the tradition of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; and then
they, not the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are the great conservers of
tradition, and they will get nothing by that. And what
universal tradition can they pretend for those books which
are rejected by some Councils; as particularly that of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea</hi>
(which is in the Code of the Universal Church,
and some of the Fathers,) which yet they now receive;
certainly in that age which rejected them, there was no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
tradition for them and those <hi>Fathers,</hi> which as <hi>(I. S.</hi>
expresses it) <hi>were eminent witnesses to their immediate
posterity or children of the Churches doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
in all likelyhood did teach their posterity what


<pb facs="tcp:64671:17"/>
themselves professed; and therefore it is possible the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in that Council and some others of the same sentiment
might joyn in saying something which might deceive their
posterity, and consequently the very ground of <hi>I. S.</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
is digg'd up, for it was very possible the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might teach something that contradicts the present
oral tradition of the Church; because when they were alive
they believed the contradictory.</p>
               <p>But further yet, can <hi>I S.</hi> affirm that by the oral tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the present Church we can be infallibly taught which
books were written by the Fathers, and which not? If he
can, how haps it that the Doctors of his Church are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
about very many of them, some rejecting that as spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
which others quote as Genuine. If he cannot, then
we may have a title to make use of the Fathers though
we did renounce tradition; because by tradition certain
and infallible they do not know it; and then if either they
do not know it at all, or know it any others ways than by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
we may know it that way as well as they, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have as good a title to make use of them as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>But the good man proceeds, <hi>Since pretended instances
of traditions failing depend on history, and histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
certainty cannot be built upon dead characters, but
on living sense in Mens hearts deliver'd from age to age
that those passages are true, that is, on Tradition, it
follows that if the way of tradition can fail, all histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is uncertain, and consequently, all instances as
being matters of fact depending on history.</hi> To this I
answer; that it is true that there are many instances in
which it is certain that tradition hath fail'd, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the following Section; and it is as true, that the
record of these instances is kept in books, which are very
Ancient and written by Authors so credible, that no
man questions the truth of these instances: Now I grant
that we are told by the words deliver'd by our Forefathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:18"/>
that these books were written by such men; but then it may
be our Forefathers though they kept the books safe, yet
knew not what was written in them; and if all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the book had been left only to rely upon the living
sense in their hearts, and the hearts of their posterity,
we should have had but few books, and few instances of the
failing of tradition, only one great one would have been
left, that is, the losing of almost all, that that is now
recorded would have been a fatal sign that Traditions fail
was the cause of so sad a loss. It is well, tradition hath
help'd us to the dead characters; they bear their living
sense so within themselves, that it is quickly understood
when living men come to read them. But now I demand of
<hi>I. S.</hi> whether or no historical certainty relies only on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and indefectible tradition? If it does not, then a man
may be certain enough of the sacred history, though there
be no certain oral tradition <hi>built on living sense in mens
hearts delivered from age to age.</hi> If he does, then I
must ask whether <hi>I. S.</hi> does believe <hi>Tacitus,</hi> or that there
was such a man as <hi>Agricola,</hi> or that the Senate decreed
that <hi>Nero</hi> should be punish'd <hi>more majorum.</hi> If he does
believe these stories, and these persons, then he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
conclude that there is an Oral indefectible tradition
that <hi>Tacitus</hi> wrote this book, and that every thing in
that book was written by him, and it remains at this day
as it was at first, and that all this was not convey'd by
dead and unfens'd characters, but by living sense in our
hearts. But now it will be very hard for any man to say
that there is such an infallible Tradition delivering all
that <hi>Roman</hi> story which we believe to be true. No
man pretends that there is; and therefore, 1. History
may be relied on without a certain indefectible oral tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And 2. The tradition that consigns history to after
ages may be, and is so most commonly, nothing but of a fame
that such a book was written by such a famous person who
liv'd in that age, and might know the truth of what he


<pb facs="tcp:64671:18"/>
wrote, and had no reason to lie, but was in all regards a
very worthy and a credible person. Now here is as much
certainty as need to be; the thing it self will bear no more;
and almost all humane affairs are transacted by such an
Oeconomy as this; and therefore it is certain enough, and
is so esteemed, because it does all it's intentions, and
loses no advantage, and perswades effectually, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
engages to all those actions and events, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
could do, if the certainty were much greater. For
the certainty of persuasion, and prevailing upon the
greatest parts of mankind, may be as great by history,
wisely and with great probability transmitted, as it
can be by any imaginary certainty of a tradition that
any dreamer can dream of. Nay, it may be equal to a
demonstration, I mean, as to the certainty of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
For a little reason to a little understanding as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
prevailes, as a greater to a deep and inquisitive
understanding; and mankind does not need demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in any case, but where reason is puzled with an
<hi>aequilibrium,</hi> and that there be great probabilities <hi>hinc
inde.</hi> And therefore in these cases where is a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
on one side and no appearance of reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
that probability does the work of a demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>For a reason to believe a thing, and no reason
to disbelieve it, is as proper a way to persuade and
to lead to action as that which is demonstrated.</hi>
And this is the case of history, and of instances;
which though they cannot (no not by an Oral tradition) be
so certain, as that the thing could not possibly have been
otherwise; yet when there is no sufficient cause of suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fraud and imposture, and great reason from any
topic to believe that it is true, he is a very fool that will
forbear to act upon that account, only because it is possible
that that instance might have been not true, though he
have no reason to think it false. And yet this foolish
sophisme runs mightily along in <hi>I. S.</hi> his demonstrations,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:19"/>
he cannot for his life distinguish between <hi>credible</hi> and <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;</hi>
Nothing by him can make faith unless it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
that is, nothing can make faith but that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
it, by turning it into Science.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His last argument for his second way of mining is so like
the other that it is the worse for it:</hi> [Since reasons are
fetch'd from the Natures of things, and the best na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in what it is (abstracting from disease and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
unalterable, is the ground of the humane part
of Christian tradition, and most incomparable strength
is supperadded to it as it is Christian, by the superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
assistances of the Holy Ghost. It is a wild conceit
to think any peice of nature or discourse built on it
can be held certain, if Tradition (especially Christian
tradition) may be held uncertain.]</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Jargon,</hi> for I know not what else to call it, there
are a pretty company of nothings put together; that indeed
they are <hi>inke varied in divers figures, and unsensed
characters,</hi> they are nothing else. For 1. It is false
that all <hi>reason</hi> (for so he must mean, if he would speak to
any purpose) <hi>is fetch'd from the natures of things;</hi> some
rely upon Concessions and presuppositions only; some upon
the state of exterior affairs, and introduced Oeconomies,
or accidental mesnage of things; some upon presumptions,
and some even upon the weaknesses of men, upon contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and some which pretend to be reasons rely upon false
grounds, and such are <hi>I. S.</hi> his demonstrations.</p>
               <p>But suppose they did, as indeed the best reasons do, what
then? Why then, the <hi>best nature,</hi> that is, I suppose he
means (the humane) <hi>unalterable (abstracting from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
and madness) is the ground of the humane part of
Christian tradition.</hi> This proposition hath in it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is false, and something that is to no purpose.
That which is false is, that <hi>the nature of man unless he
be mad, or diseas'd in his brain, is Unalterable.</hi> As if
men could not be chang'd by interest or ambition, pride or


<pb facs="tcp:64671:19"/>
prejudice, by weakness and false Apostles, mistake or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
And by any of these a man, that naturally hath
faculties to understand, and capacity of learning, and
speaking truth may be so changed, that he is very alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from good to bad, from wise to foolish, from the
knowledge of the truth to believe a lie, and be transported
by illusions of the Devil: Every man naturally loves know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that's his nature; and it is the best nature; but
yet it is so alterable, that some men who from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of this best nature are willing to learn, and they <hi>are
ever learning,</hi> yet they are so <hi>altered,</hi> that <hi>they never
come to the knowledge of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But supposing that this best nature is the ground of <hi>the
humane part of tradition,</hi> yet it is not the ground of the
humane part of tradition as it is <hi>unalterable;</hi> but as it
hath a defectible understanding, and a free and a change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
will, and innumerable weaknesses, for these are so in
this best nature, that it can never be without them. And
therefore because this ground may be slippery, there will be
no sure <hi>footing</hi> here: Especially since it is but the ground
of the humane part of tradition, for which cause it can be
no more ground of truth in religion, than the <hi>Roman</hi> sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
than <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Livy</hi> is of infallible indefectible
truth in history; and therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> does very wisely add to
this, <hi>the incomparable strengths of the supernatural
assistances of the Holy Ghost.</hi> But these alone can be
sufficient, if they could be proved to be given infallibly,
absolutely, and without the altering condition of our mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
right use of them, without grieving the Holy Spirit; of
which because there is no promise, and no experience, it is
no <hi>wild Conceit</hi> to think tradition may be uncertain, and
yet our discourses in Religion by other principles be certain
enough. But now I perceive that <hi>I. S.</hi> is no such impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
man, for all the seeming fierceness of his persuasion
in his new mode of Oral tradition, but that in time he
may be reduc'd to the old way of this Church; and ground


<pb facs="tcp:64671:20"/>
(as he does mainly here) her infallibility not upon new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
taken from the nature of things, but upon
the continual <hi>assistances and helpes of the only infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spirit of God.</hi> That indeed is a way possible, if it
were to be had; but this new way hath neither sense nor
reason: And therefore in this place he wisely puts the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
stress upon the other. I should have proceeded a little
further, if I could have understood what <hi>I. S.</hi> means, by
<hi>[any piece of nature built on Tradition;]</hi> and if he had
not here put in the phrase of a <hi>wild Conceit,</hi> I should
have wanted a name for it; but because it is no other, I
shall now let it alone, and dig into the other mines, and
see if they be more dangerous than these Bugbears.</p>

               <p>THe third Way I must needs say is a fine one, He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to prove my Dissuasive to be no Dissuasive, no nor
can it be a Dissuasive. And why? because <hi>to Dissuade,
is to unfix the understanding from what it held before;
which includes to make it hold or assent, that what it
held before certain, is false or at least uncertain.</hi> And
here before I proceed further, it is fit we acknowledge, that
we owe to <hi>I. S.</hi> the notice of these two mysteries. 1. What
is meant by Dissuading, and that it is <hi>making a man to
change his opinion,</hi> an <hi>unfixing of his mind:</hi> And the
second, That this unfixing the minde makes the minde to
<hi>shake, or to be chang'd, to be uncertain or to think
the proposition fit to be held:</hi> we being thus instructed
in these grounds of some new design'd demonstration, may
the surer proceed: For wisely he adds a conjecture, that
surely by my Dissuasive from Popery, I intend <hi>to oblige
men to assent to the contrary.</hi> I do believe indeed I
did; but my first aim was to dissuade, that is <hi>to unfixe</hi>
them, and afterwards to establish them in the contrary.
Well! thus far we are agreed; but for all this, <hi>The thing


<pb facs="tcp:64671:20"/>
I intend cannot be done by me; I cannot dissuade; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have no peculiar method of my own;</hi> but I use
those means which others use to prove errors by, and if the
way I take be common to truth and error, It is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
error shall pretend to it as well as truth: I must
have a <hi>particularity of method above what is in others.</hi>
Now this is strange, that I should be so severely dealt with;
why is more requir'd of me than of others? I take the same
way that the writers of books of controversie us'd to take;
I quote Scriptures, and Fathers, and Histories, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and I use reason as well as I can: I finde that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
and <hi>Baronius, Card. Perron</hi> and <hi>Gregory de
Valentia, Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Hart, Champian</hi> and <hi>Reynolds</hi>
use the same Dull way as I do; and yet they hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
and Dissuade according to the subject matter, and
why my penny should not be as good silver as theirs I know not;
but I hope I shall know by and by, why, the true reason why
I cannot Dissuade, and that <hi>I miscall my book a Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>
is, because the method which I take is <hi>common to
those discourses which have in them power to satisfie
the understanding, and those who have no such power.</hi>
But herein is a wonderful thing, my book cannot dissuade;
because I take a way which is taken in discourses which can
satisfie the understanding. For if some discourses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
my way can satisfie the Understanding, as <hi>I. S.</hi>
here confesses, then it is to be hop'd, so may mine; at
least there is nothing in my method to hinder it, but it
may: yea, but this method is also us'd in Discourses which
have no such power, well! and what then? Is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my method as good a method as can be, when it is the
method that all men use; they that can satisfie the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and they that cannot. And is there any thing
more ignorant than to think a method, or way of proof is
nought, because some men use it to good purposes, and
some to bad? And is not light a glorious covering, because
the evil spirit sometimes puts it on? Was not our Saviours


<pb facs="tcp:64671:21"/>
way of confuting the Devil by Scripture very good, because
the Devil us'd the same way, and so it was a <hi>way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to discourses, that have in them the power to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the understanding, and those which have no such
power. Titius</hi> is sued by <hi>Sempronius</hi> for a farm which
he had long possess'd and to which <hi>Titius</hi> proves his title
by indubitable records and laws and patents. <hi>Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
pretends to do so too; and tells the Judge that he ought
not to regard any proof of <hi>Titius</hi>'s offering, because he
goes upon grounds which himself also goes upon; and so they
are not apt to be a ground of determining any thing, because
they are Common to both sides. The Judge smiles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
who hath most right to the pretended grounds, but
approves the method of proceeding, because it is common
to the contrary pretender: And this is so far from being
an argument against my method, that in the world nothing
can be said greater in allowance of it; even because I prov'd
upon principles allowed by both sides, that is, I dispute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
principles, upon which we are agreed to put the cause
to trial. Did the primitive Fathers refuse to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by, or to argue from Scriptures, because the heretics
did argue from thence too? Did not the Fathers take
from them their armour in which they trusted? And did
not <hi>David</hi> strike with the sword of <hi>Goliath,</hi> because that
was the sword which his Enemy had us'd? <hi>David</hi> prov'd
that way apt to prevail by cutting off the Giants head. But
what particularity of method would <hi>I. S.</hi> have me to use? shall
I use reason? To that all the world pretends, and it is the
sword that cuts on both sides, and it is us'd in discourses
that can, and that cannot satisfie. Shall I use the
Scriptures? in that <hi>I. S.</hi> is pleas'd to say, the Quakers
out-do me? Shall I use the Fathers? The <hi>Smectymnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
bring Fathers against Episcopacy. What shall I
bring? I know not what yet, but it ought to be something
very particular; that's certain. Shall I then bring Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
will Oral tradition do it? I hope <hi>I. S.</hi> will for his


<pb facs="tcp:64671:21"/>
own and his three or four friends sake like that way. But
if I should take it, <hi>I. S:</hi> might very justly say, that I take
a method that is common to those discourses, which have
in them power to satisfie the understanding, and those
which have no such power: Whether this method is us'd or
no in discourses satisfactory, let <hi>I. S.</hi> Speak; but I am
sure it is us'd of late in some discourses, which are not
satisfactory, and the name of one of them is <hi>Sure footing.</hi>
And do not the <hi>Greeks</hi> pretend tradition against the <hi>Roman</hi>
doctrine of Purgatory, the procession of the Holy Ghost, the
supremacy of the Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi> whether right or
wrong I inquire not here, but that they do so is evident; and
therefore neither is it lawful for me to proceed this way, or
even then to call my book a Dissuasive. <hi>For it is plain to
common sense, that it can have in it no power of moving
the understanding one way or other, unles there be some
particularity in the method above what is in others;</hi>
which it is certain can never be, because there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
but some or other have already taken it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I perceive plainly, my book is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not any more to be called
a Dissuasive, till I can find out some new way and method
which as yet was never us'd in Christendom. And indeed I
am to account my self the more unsuccessful in my well
meant endeavours, because <hi>I. S.</hi> tells us <hi>that he sees</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that in the pursuit of truth, <hi>Method is in a manner
All; I. S.</hi> hath a method new enough, not so old as
Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and he desires me to get such another; but
<hi>nobis non licet esse tam beatis;</hi> and I am the less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for it, because <hi>I. S.</hi> his Method is <hi>new,</hi> but not <hi>right,</hi>
and I prove it from an argument of his own; <hi>For</hi> (saith
he) <hi>it is impossible any controversie should hover long
in debate, if a right method of concluding evidently
were carefully taken, and faithfully held to.</hi> Now
because I see that <hi>I. S.</hi> his method or new way hath made
a new controversie, but hath ended none, but what was
before and what is now is as likely as ever, still <hi>to hover


<pb facs="tcp:64671:22"/>
in debate; I. S.</hi> must needs conclude, that either he hath
not faithfully held to it, or his way is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Other things he says here, which though they be rude
and uncivil, yet because he repeats them in his Sixth way,
I shall there consider them altogether, if I find cause.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="way">
               <head>The fourth Way.</head>
               <p>THis fourth mine hath (as good luck would have it) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of demonstration, nor is his reason founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the nature of the thing (as before he boasted) but only <hi>ad
hominem.</hi> But such as it is, it must be considered. The
argument is this, <hi>That though I produce testimony from
Fathers, yet I do not allow them to be infallible, nor
yet my self in interpreting Scripture; nor yet do I with
any infalliable certainty see any proposition, I go about
to deduce by reason, to be necessarily consequent to
any first or self evident principle, and therefore I am
certain of nothing I alledge in my whole book.</hi> The
sum is this, <hi>No man is certain of any thing, unless he
be infallible.</hi> I confess I am not infallible, and yet I am
certain this must be his meaning, or else his words have no
sense; and if I say true in this, then <hi>fallibility</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
are not such incompossible and inconsistent things.
But what does <hi>I. S.</hi> think of himself? is he infallible? I
do not well know what he will answer, for he seems to be
very neer it, if we may guess by the glorious opinion he
hath of himself; but I will suppose him more modest than
to think he is, and yet he talkes at that rate, as if his
arguments were demonstrations, and his opinions certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Suppose his grounds he goes upon are as true, as I
know they are false; yet is he infallible in his reasoning,
and deducing from those principles such feat conclusions,
as he offers to obtrude upon the world? If his reason be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:22"/>
so it may be, mine is for ought. I know, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought it so yet; and yet I know no reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but it is as infallible as his: but if his be not, it
may be all that he says is false, at least he is not sure any
thing of it is true; and then he may make use of his own
ridiculous speech he made for me [I know not certainly that
any thing I say against your religion is true,<note place="margin">Page 258.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> All the
men that tell us that Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> is now Pope, are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
they may be deceiv'd and they may deceive; and yet
I suppose Mr. <hi>White,</hi> though he also be fallible, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
certain he is so; and if he did make any doubt, if
he would sail to <hi>Italy,</hi> he would be infallibly assur'd of it
by the Executioners of the Popes Censures, who yet are as
fallible as any the officers of <hi>Montfalcon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>I. S.</hi> however says, I ought to confess that I ought not
to dissuade from any thing, <hi>in case neither the Fathers nor
my self be infallible in any saying or proof of theirs.</hi>
For the infallibility of the Fathers, I shall have a more
convenient time to consider it under his eighth way. But
now I am to consider his reason for this pretty saying, which
he says <hi>he evinces thus. Since to be infallible in none,</hi>
hic &amp; nunc <hi>(taking in the whole complexion of assisting
circumstances) is the same as to be</hi> hic &amp; nunc <hi>fallible
in all or each; and if they be fallible, or may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in each, they can be sure of none, it follows
that who professes the Fathers and himself (though
using all the means he can to secure him from error)
fallible in each, must, if he will speak out like an
honest man, confess he is sure of none.]</hi> This is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
demonstration, and indeed there are in it some
things evidently demonstrative. The first is, That to
be infallible in none, is the same as to be fallible in
all. Indeed I must needs say, that he says true and
learnedly, and it being a self evident Principle he
might according to his custome have afforded demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
enough for this, but I shall take it upon his own


<pb facs="tcp:64671:23"/>
word at this time, and allow him the honour of first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
this secret to the ignorant world; that <hi>he that
is not infallible is fallible.</hi> Another deep note we have
here; his words laid plain without their <hi>Parentheses,</hi> can
best declare the mystery <hi>[If they be infallible, or may be
deceiv'd in each, they can be sure of none; it follows
that they that profess they are fallible in each, must
confess they are sure of none.</hi> If <hi>I. S.</hi> always write
thus subtilly, no man will ever be able to resist him: For
indeed this is a demonstration, and therefore we hope it
may be <hi>aeternae veritatis,</hi> for it relies upon this first and
self evident principle, <hi>idem per idem semper facit idem.</hi>
Now having well learned these two deep notes out of the
school, and deep discourses of <hi>I. S.</hi> let us see what the man
would be at for himself: and though we find it in his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheses</hi>
only, yet they could not be left out, and sense be
intire without them.</p>
               <p>When he talkes of being infallible, if the notion be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to his Church, then he means an infallibility, <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
absolute, unconditionate,</hi> such as will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Church ever to err. And because he thinks such
an infallibility to be necessary, for the setling the doubting
mindes of men; he affirms roundly, if <hi>infallibility be
denied, then no man can be sure of any thing.</hi> But
then when he comes to consider the particulars, and cannot
but see, a man may be certain of some things, though he
have not that antecedent infallibility, that quality and
permanent grace; yet because he will not have his Dear
notion lost, that <hi>infallibility and certainty live and dye
together,</hi> he hath now secretly put in a changeling in the
place of the first, and hath excogitated an infallibility
<hi>consequent, conditionate, circumstantiate,</hi> which he
calls <hi>hic &amp; nunc, taking in the whole complexion of
assisting circumstances;</hi> Now because the first is denied
by us to be in any man or company of men, and he perceives
that to be uncertain in every thing, will not be consequent


<pb facs="tcp:64671:23"/>
to the want of this first sort, he secretly slides into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and makes his consequent to rely upon this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
And if the argument be put into intelligible terms,
it runs thus: If when a whole complexion of assisting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
are present; that is, a proposition truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
apt to be understood, necessary to be learned, and
attended to by a person desirous to learn, when it is taught
by sufficient authority, or prov'd by evidence, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by reason; when a man hath his eyes and his wits
about him, and is sincerely desirous of truth, and to that
purpose, himself considers, and he confers with others and
prays to God; and the thing it self is also plain and easie;
then if a man can be deceiv'd, he is sure of nothing: And
this is <hi>infallibility hic &amp; nunc.</hi> But this is not that
which he and his parties contend to be seated in his Church;
for such a one as this we allow to her, if she does her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if she prays to God, if she consider as well as she can,
and be no way transported with interest or partiality; then
in such propositions which God hath adopted into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith, and which are plain and intended to be known
and believ'd by all, there is no question but she is infallible,
that is, she is secur'd from error in such things. But then
every man also hath a part of this infallibility. Some
things are of their own nature so plain, that a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in them, as a man may infallibly know, that two
and two make four. And a Christian may be infallibly
sure that the Scriptures say, that <hi>Jesus Christ is the
Son of God,</hi> and that there shall be <hi>a resurrection from
the dead,</hi> and that they who do <hi>the works of the flesh
shall not inherit the kingdom of God;</hi> And as fallible
as I, or any Protestant is, yet we cannot be deceived in
this; if it be made a question whether fornication be a thing
forbidden in the New Testament we are certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
so, that in that book it is written, <hi>flee fornication.</hi>
An infallibility <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> if that will serve <hi>I. S.</hi> his
turn, we have it for him; and he cannot say, that we


<pb facs="tcp:64671:24"/>
Protestants affirm that we are fallible when we do our duty,
and when all the assisting circumstances, which God hath
made sufficient and necessary, are present: we are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as infallibility it self, that among the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
one is, <hi>Thou shalt not worship any graven Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages:</hi>
and another, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery:</hi>
and so concerning all the plain sayings in Scripture, we are
certain that they carry their meaning on their forehead,
and we cannot be deceiv'd, unless we please not to make use
of all <hi>the complexion of assisting circumstances.</hi> And
this certainty or circumstantiate infallibility we derive
from self evident principles; such as this, <hi>God is never
wanting to them that do the best they can,</hi> and this,
<hi>In matters which God requires of us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deus neminem deserit nisi pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us deserentem.</note> 
                  <hi>if we fail not in
what is on our part, God will not fail on his.</hi> And this
infallibility is just like to what is signified by what God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to <hi>Joshua, I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Josh. 1. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>only be thou strong and very couragious, that
thou mayest observe to do according to all the law.</hi>
Nothing was more certain than that <hi>Joshua</hi> should be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
conducted into the land of promise, and yet it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him to be couragious, and to keep all the Law of
<hi>Moses;</hi> and because <hi>Joshua</hi> did so, the promise had an
infallibility, <hi>hic &amp; nunc:</hi> And so it is in the finding out
the truths of God, so said our Blessed Saviour, <hi>If ye
love me keep my Commandements, and I will pray to
the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 15, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and he shall give you another Comforter
that he may abide with you for ever, the Spirit of
truth whom the world cannot receive.</hi> If we open our
eyes, if we suffer not a Vail to be over them, if we inquire
with diligence and simplicity, and if we live well, we shall
be infallibly directed, and upon the same termes it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
certain that every man shall be saved. And <hi>the
Gospel is not hid, but to them that are lost</hi> (saith the
Apostle) <hi>in whom the God of this world hath blinded
the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of


<pb facs="tcp:64671:24"/>
the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image
of God, should shine unto them.</hi> So that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that in things necessary, a man need not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
unless he be wanting to himself; and therefore <hi>hic &amp;
nunc</hi> he is infallible: But if a man will lay aside his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and will not make use of it, if he resolves to believe a
proposition in defiance of all that can be said against it; if
when he sees reason against his proposition, he will call it
a temptation, which is like being hardned by miracles,
and slighting a truth, because it is too well prov'd to him;
if he will not trust the instruments of knowledge that God
gives him, if he sets his face against his reason, and think
it meritorious to distrust his sense, and <hi>seeing will not
see, and hearing he will not understand,</hi> (And all this
is every day done in the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> then there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so certain, but it becomes to him uncertain; and it is
no wonder if he be given over to believe a lie. It is not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that makes a man infallibly certain, for then <hi>I. S.</hi> were
the most infallible person in the world; but the way to <hi>make
our calling and election sure,</hi> is to <hi>work out our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with fear and trembling.</hi> Modesty is the way to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and by how much more a man fears to be deceiv'd, by so
much the more will he walk circumspectly and determine
warily, and take care he be not deceiv'd; but he that thinks he
cannot be deceived, but that he is infallible, as he is the more
liable to error, because by this suppos'd infallibility he is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to a greater inconsideration, so if he be deceived, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
is the more desperate. And I desire that it be here
observ'd, that it is one thing to say, <hi>I cannot be deceiv'd,</hi>
and another to say, <hi>I am sure I am not deceiv'd.</hi> For the
first no man can say; but the latter every wise and good
man may say if he please; That every man is certain of
very many things is evident by all the experience of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and in many things this certainty is equivalent to an
infallibility, that is, <hi>hic &amp; nunc:</hi> And that relys upon
this ground (for I must be careful to go upon grounds for


<pb facs="tcp:64671:25"/>
fear of <hi>I. S.</hi> his displeasure) <hi>Quicquid est, quamdiu est,
necesse est esse;</hi> while a truth prevailes, and is invested
with the <hi>whole complexion of assisting circumstances,</hi>
it is an actual infallibility, that is, such a certainty, <hi>cui
falsum subesse non potest;</hi> for else no man could tell
certainly and infallibly, when he is hungry or thirsty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
or weary; when he hath committed a sin against God,
or when he hath told a lie: and he that says a fallible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is not infallibly certain, that it is a good thing to say
his prayers, and to put his trust in God, and to do good
works, knows not what he says.</p>
               <p>But besides this, it were well if <hi>I. S.</hi> would consider
what kind of certainty God requires of us in our faith; for
I hope <hi>I. S.</hi> will then require no more. Our faith is not
Science, and yet it is certainty; and if the assent be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the whole design of it, and effects all it's purposes
and the intention of God, it cannot be accepted though the
wayes of begetting that faith be not demonstrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There had but five or six persons seen Christ after
his resurrection, and yet he was pleas'd to reprove their
unbelief, because the Disciples did not believe those few
who said they had seen him alive. Faith is the foundation
of good life; and if a man believes so certainly that he
is willing to live in it, and die for it, God requires no
more, and there is no need of more; and if a little thing
did not do that, what shall become of those innumerable
multitudes of Christians, who believe upon grounds which
a learned man knows are very weak, but yet are to those
people as good as the best, because they are not only the
best they have, but they are sufficient to do their work for
them. Nay God is so good, and it is so necessary in some
affairs to proceed so, that a man may be certain he does
well, though in the proposition or subject matter he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.
Is not a Judge infallibly certain, that he does his
duty, and proceeds wisely, if he gives sentence <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
allegata &amp; probata,</hi> though he be not infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain


<pb facs="tcp:64671:25"/>
that the witnesses depose truth. Was not S. <hi>Paul</hi> in
the right, and certainly so, when he said <hi>it was better
for the present necessity, if a Virgin did not marry;</hi>
and yet he had no revelation, and no oral infallible tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it; <hi>this speak I</hi> (saith he) <hi>not the Lord;</hi> and
he did not talk confidently of his grounds, but said modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>I think I have the Spirit of God;</hi> and yet all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
believe that what he then said was infallibly enough
true. <hi>We see here through a glass darkly,</hi> saith the
Apostle, and yet we see; and what we see we may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of, I mean, we Protestants may, indeed the Papists
may not, for they denying what they see, call bread a God:
so that they do not so much as see darkly, they see not at
all, or what is as bad, they will not believe the thing to be
that which their eyes, and three senses more tell them that
it is. But is a wonder that they who dare not trust
their senses, should talk of being infallible in their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And now to apply this to the charge <hi>I. S.</hi> lays on me, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I do not profess to be infallible, I am certain in
nothing, and without an infallible oral tradition, it is
impossible I should be certain of any thing.</hi> In answer
to this, I demand why I may not be as certain of what I
know or believe, as Mr. <hi>White</hi> or <hi>I. S.?</hi> Is the doctrine
of Purgatory fire between death and the day of judgement,
and of the validity of the prayers and Masses said in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the freeing of souls from Purgatory
long before the day of judgment, is this doctrine (I say) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by an infallible oral tradition, or no? <hi>If no,</hi> then
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> either is not certain it is true, or else
she is certain of it by some other way than such a tradition.
<hi>If yea,</hi> then how is Mr. <hi>White</hi> certain that he speaks true
in his book <hi>de statu animarum,</hi> where he teaches that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Church do no good, and free no souls before the
day of judgement, for he hath no oral tradition for his
opinion; for two oral traditions cannot be certain and


<pb facs="tcp:64671:26"/>
infallible, when they contradict one another; and if the
traditions be not infallible, as good for these men that they
be none at all. So that either Mr. <hi>White</hi> cannot be certain
of any thing he says, by not relying on oral tradition, or
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be certain; and therefore he or
she may forbear to persuade their friends to any thing. And
for my present adversary <hi>I. S.</hi> who also affirms, that oral
tradition of the present Church is the <hi>whole rule of faith,</hi>
how can he trust himself or be certain of any thing, or teach
any thing, when his Church says otherwise than he says, and
makes tradition to be but <hi>a part of the rule of faith,</hi> as is
to be seen in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it self in the first decree
of the fourth Session.<note place="margin">Perspiciensque hanc verita tem, &amp; disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinam conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neri in libris scriptis &amp; sine scripto traditionibus—omnes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros tamveteris quam N.

of faith, and therefore two Churches; Mr. <hi>I. S.'s</hi> is <hi>the
traditionary Church,</hi> so called from relying solely on tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the other (what shall we call it for distinction sake)
<hi>the Purgatorian Church</hi> from Purgatory, or if you will,
<hi>the imaginary Church</hi> from worshiping images: And since
they do not both follow the same rule of faith, the one mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tradition alone to be the ground, the other not so; it
will follow by Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> his argument, that either the one or
the other missing the true ground of faith, cannot be certain
of any thing that they say. And now when he hath considered
these things, let him reckon the advantage which his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
faith gains by the opposition from her adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
if they be rightly handled,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath handled
them, and <hi>brought to his grounds)</hi> But however the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which I have now made, hath it's advantages upon
the weakness of Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> grounds, and <hi>I. S.'s</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
yet I shall without relation to them, but upon the
account of other grounds which his wiser and more learned
brethren of the other Church do lay, make it appear that
there is indeed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no sure footing, no
foundation of faith upon which a man can with certainty
rely, and say, Now I am infallibly sure that I am in the
right.</p>

               <head>The fifth Way.</head>
               <p>THe fifth way <hi>I. S.</hi> says <hi>is built on the fourth,</hi> which
being prov'd to be a ruinous foundation, I have the
less need to trouble my self about that which will fall of it
self, but because he had no reason to trust that foundation,
for all his confidence he is glad to build his fifth way on the
<hi>Protestants voluntary Concession, for they granting
they have no demonstration for the ground of their
faith, must say they have only probability.</hi> But I pray
who told <hi>I. S.</hi> that we grant we have no demonstration for
the ground of our faith? Did ever any Protestant say
that there is no moral demonstration of his faith? or that
it cannot be prov'd so certain, so infallible, that <hi>the
gates of hell shall never prevail against it?</hi> If <hi>I. S.</hi> will
descend so low as to look upon the book of a Protestant,
besides many better,<note place="margin">Book 1. chap. pag. 124.</note> he may finde in my Cases of Conscience
a demonstration of Christian Religion; and although it
consists of probabilities, yet so many, so unquestion'd, so
confess'd, so reasonable, so uncontradicted pass into an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of as much certainty, as humane nature without a
Miracle is capable of; as many sands heap'd together
make a bank strong enough to resist the impetuosity of the
raging sea. But I have already shown upon what certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
our faith relies, and if we had nothing but high proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
it must needs be as good as their prudential mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
and therefore I shall not repeat any thing, but pass on to
consider what it is he says of our high probabilities, if they
were no more: <hi>If there be probabilities on both sides, then
the greatest must carry it,</hi> so he roundly professes, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the latter <hi>Casuists</hi> of his Church, I mean those
who wrote since <hi>Angelus, Silvester, Cordubensis</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan,</hi>
do expresly teach the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that of two


<pb facs="tcp:64671:27"/>
probabilities the less may be chosen; and that this is the
common and more receiv'd opinion. But since <hi>I. S.</hi> is in
the right, let them and he agree it, as we do, if they
please. I hope he relates this only to the Questions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, and <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to the Christian Faith;
well, but if the matter be only between us, I am well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
content, and the greater probability, that is, the
better argument shall carry it; and I will not be asking any
more odd Questions, as why, <hi>I. S.</hi> having so clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
his religion by grounds firm as the land of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi>
or <hi>O Brasile,</hi> he should now be content to argue his cause
at the bar of probability? Well, but let us see what he says
for his party: <hi>That there is no probability for our side</hi>
(says <hi>I. S.) is very hard to be said, since the whole world
sees plainly we still maintain the field against them,
nay dare pretend without fearing an absolute baffle,
which must needs follow (had we not at least probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to befriend us) that our grounds are evidently
and demonstrably certain.]</hi> Here <hi>I. S.</hi> seems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
again, of his probabilities, that he still runs to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
under his broad shield of demonstration: but his <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulatum</hi>
here is indeed very modest; he seems to desire us
to allow that there are some probable things to be said for
his side, and indeed he were very hard hearted that should
say, there are none at all; some probabilities we shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but no grounds evidently and demonstratively cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
good Sir, And yet let me tell you this, There are
some of your propositions for which there is probable reason
or fair pretence in the world: Nothing that can handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or ingeniously deceive a man: Such as is your half Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
worship of images, prayers not understood and
some others: And therefore you may be ashamed to say, you
still maintain the field against us, for if you do not, why
do you say you do? but if you still maintain the field, you
may be more asham'd, for why will you stand in a falshood,
and then call your selves equal combatants, if not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.


<pb facs="tcp:64671:27"/>
But you may if you please look after victory, I
am only in the pursuit of truth.</p>
               <p>But to return, It seems he knows my mind for this, and
in my liberty of prophecying, <hi>my own words will beyond
all confute evince it, that they have probabilities, and
those strong ones too.</hi> But now (in my Conscience) this
was unkindly done, that when I had spoken for them what
I could, and more than I knew that they had ever said for
themselves, and yet to save them harmless from the iron
hands of a tyrant and unreasonable power, to keep them
from being persecuted for their errors and opinions, that
they should take the arms I had lent them for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and throw them at my head. But the best of it is,
though <hi>I. S.</hi> be unthankful, yet the weapons themselves are
but wooden daggers, intended only to represent how the
poor men are cosen'd by themselves, and that under fair
and fraudulent pretences even pious well meaning men,
and men wise enough <hi>in other things</hi> may be abus'd: And
though what I said was but tinsel and pretence, imagery and
whipt Cream, yet I could not be blam'd to use no better
than the best their cause would bear; yet if that be the
best they have to say for themselves, their probabilities
will be soon out-ballanc'd by one Scripture testimony urg'd
by Protestants; and <hi>Thou shalt not worship any graven
images</hi> will out weigh all the best and fairest imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Church. But since from me they borrow their
light armour which is not Pistol proof, from me if they
please they may borrow a remedy to undeceive them, and
that in the same kind and way of arguing: If <hi>I. S.</hi> please
to read a letter or two of mine to a Gentlewoman not long
before abus'd in her religion by some <hi>Roman</hi> Emissaries,
there he shall see so very much said against the <hi>Roman</hi>
way, and that in instances evident and notorious, that <hi>I. S.</hi>
may if he please (he hath my leave) put them in ballance
against one another,<note place="margin">Collection of Polemical and moral discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Pag. 703,</hi>
                  </note> and try which will preponderate. They
are printed now in one Volume, and they are the easier


<pb facs="tcp:64671:28"/>
compar'd. But then <hi>I. S.</hi> might if he had pleas'd have
considered, that I did not intend to make that harangue, to
represent, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion had probabilities of
being true, but probabilities that the religion might be tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
or might be endured, that is, as I there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
it, whether the Doctrines be commenc'd upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and manag'd with impiety, and have effects not to be
endur'd; and concerning these things I amass'd a heap of
considerations, by which it might appear probable, that
they were not so bad as to be intollerable; and if I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
it was but a well meant error, hereafter they shall
speak for themselves, only for their comfort this they
might have also observ'd in that book, that there is not half
so much excuse for the <hi>Papists,</hi> as there is for the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists;</hi>
and yet it was but an excuse at the best, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in those full answers I have given to all their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in the last edition of that book, amongst the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical
discourses in folio.</p>
               <p>I shall need to say no more for the spoiling this Mine, for
<hi>I. S.</hi> hath not so much as pretended that the probabilities
urg'd for them can out-weigh or come to equal what is said
against them; and I humbly suppose that the difficulties
will be increased by the following book.</p>

I us'd were unanswerable, and convictive, which indeed
were a pretty way of making books; to make a preface to
make good my book, and then my book cannot but in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
make good the preface; which indeed is something
like the way of proving the Scriptures by the Church, and
then back again proving the Church by the Scriptures. But

he adds that I was bound to say, <hi>That they were never
pretended to be answer'd, or could not, or that the
Protestants had the last word.</hi> But on the contrary I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that <hi>the evidences on both sides have been
so often produc'd, that it will seem almost impossible to
bring in new matter, or to prevail with the old.</hi> This
is the great charge, the sum of which is truly this. I have
spoken modestly of my own undertaking, and yet I had so
great reason to deplore the obstinacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Priests,
their pertinacy and incorrigible resolution of seeming to say
something, when they can say nothing to the purpose, that
I had cause to fear, the event would not be so successful as
the merit of our cause, and the energy of the arguments
might promise. I confess I did not rant as <hi>I. S.</hi> does, and
talk high of demonstrations, and unmistakable grounds,
and scientifical principles, and Metaphysical nothings; but
according as my undertaking requir'd, I proceeded upon
principles agreed on both sides. If Scripture and Fathers,
Councils and reasons, the analogy of faith, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Primitive Church (from which I proved, and
shall yet more clearly prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
greatly revolted) will not prevail, I have done; I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commit the cause to God and the judgement of wise and
good men, and so sit down in the peace of my own persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and in a good Conscience, that I have done my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor

               </p>
               <p>Only I wish here I had found a little more worthiness in
<hi>I. S.</hi> than to make me speaking that I have brought nothing
but common objections, or nothing new: I suppose they that
are learned know this to be a Calumny; and by experience
they and I find, that whether the objections be new or old, it
is easier to rail at them all, than answer any. To this as it
is not needful to say any more, so there cannot any thing
else well be said, unless I should be vain, like the man
whom I now reprove, and go about to commend my self,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:29"/>

for.</p>
               <p>But the seventh Way is yet worse. For it is no thing but
a direct declamation against my book, and the quotations of
it, and having made a ridiculous Engine of Corollaries in
his <hi>Sure-footing</hi> against the quotations in Dr. <hi>P.</hi> his
Sermon, without meaning my book, for that came out a
pretty while after; he does like the two penny Almanack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
though he calculated it for the meridian of the
Court Sermon (as he calls it) yet without any sensible error
it may serve for <hi>Ireland:</hi> It may be <hi>I. S.</hi> had an oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
for this way of proceeding, especially having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
so authentic a president for it as the Author of the
two Sermons called <hi>the Primitive rule before the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
who goes upon the same infallible and thrifty way,
saying <hi>[These two tracts as they are named Sermons
are an answer to Dr.</hi> Pierce, <hi>but as they may better be
styled two common places, so they are a direct answer
to Dr.</hi> Taylon. So that here are two things which are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and no Sermons, as you please not Sermons, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
places; and yet they are not altogether common places,
but they in some sense, are Sermons; unless <hi>Sermon</hi>
and <hi>common place</hi> happen to be all one; but how the same
thing should be an answer to Dr. <hi>P.</hi> as he gives them one
name, and by giving them another name, to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
should be a direct answer to me, who speak of other
matters, and by other arguments, and to other purposes,
and in another manner, I do not yet understand. But I
suppose it be meant as in <hi>I. S. his way,</hi> and that it relies
upon this first and a self evident principle, <hi>That the same
thing when called by another name is apt to do new
and wonderful things.</hi> It is a piece of Mr. <hi>White's</hi>
and <hi>I. S.</hi> his new <hi>Metaphysics</hi> which we silly men have not
the learning to understand. But it matters not what they
say, so they do but stop the mouths of the people, that call


<pb facs="tcp:64671:29"/>
upon them to say something to every new book, that they
may without apparent lying, telling them the book is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
For to answer to <hi>confute,</hi> means nothing with
them but <hi>to speak the last word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well! but so it is, <hi>I. S.</hi> hath ranged a great many of my
quotations under heads, and says, so many are confuted by
the first Corollary, and so many by the second, and so on to the
ninth and tenth, and some of them are raw and unapplyed,
some set for shew, and some not home to the point, and some
wilfully represented, and these come under the second or
third head, and <hi>perhaps of divers of the others.</hi> To
all this I have one short answer; that the quotations which
he reduces under the first head, or the second, or the third
might for ought appears be rank'd under any other as well
as these: For he hath prov'd none to belong to any; but
Magisterially points with his finger and directs them to
their several stations of confutation. Thus he supposes I
am confuted, by an argument of his, next to that of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiris
Bellarmine.</hi> And indeed in this way it were easie to
confute <hi>Bellarmines</hi> three Volumes with the labour of three
pages writing. But this way was most fit to be taken by
him, who quotes the Fathers by oral tradition, and not
ocular inspection; however if he had not particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
these things, he ought not generally to have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them, before he tried. But this was an old trick, and
noted of some by <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi>

these new men have taken their answers, and made use of
them to little purposes; and therefore I shall now pass over
the particulars of the quotations referring them to their
places, and consider if there be any thing more material
in his eighth Way, by which he pretends to blow up my

            <div n="8" type="way">
               <head>The eighth Way.</head>
               <p>THe eighth Way is to pick out <hi>the principles</hi> I rely on,
and to shew their weakness. It is well this eighth Way
is a great distance off from his first way; or else <hi>I. S.</hi> would
have no excuse for forgetting himself so palpably; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at first laid to my charge that I went upon <hi>no grounds,
no principles.</hi> But I perceive, principles might be found
in the Dissuasive if the man had a mind to it: <hi>nay maine
and fundamental principles, and self evident</hi> to me.
And yet such is his ill luck, that he picks out such which he
himself says I do not call so; And even here also he is
mistaken too; for the first he instances is <hi>Scripture;</hi> and
this, not only I but all Protestants acknowledge to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our whole faith. But of this he says we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
afterwards.</p>
               <p>The second principle I rely upon, at least, he says I seem
to do so, is, <hi>[We all acknowledge that the whole Church
of God kept the faith intire, and transmitted faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to after ages the whole faith.]</hi> Well what says he to
this principle? He says, this principle as to the positive
part is good, and assertive of tradition: <hi>It is so</hi> of the
Apostolical tradition; for they deliver'd the doctrine of
Christ to their Successors, both by preaching and by
writing. And what hath <hi>I. S.</hi> got by this? Yes, give him
but leave to suppose that this delivery of the doctrine of
Christ was only by oral tradition for the three first ages,
(for he is pleas'd so to understand the extent of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church) and then he will infer <hi>that the third age


<pb facs="tcp:64671:30"/>
could deliver it to the fourth, and that to the fifth; and
so to us: If they were able, there is no question but they
were willing, for it concern'd them to be so, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was done.</hi> Though all this be not true, for we see by
a sad experience, that too few in the world are willing to
do, what it concerns them most to do: Yet for the present I
grant all this. And what then? therefore oral tradition is
the only rule of faith. Soft and fair, therefore the third
age deliver'd it to the fourth, and so on, but not all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
by oral tradition, but by the holy Scriptures, as I
shall largely prove in the proper place. But to <hi>I. S.</hi> the Bells
ring no tune, but <hi>Whittington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third principle he says is this, <hi>The present Roman
doctrines which are in difference were invisible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of in the first and best antiquity.]</hi> I know not why
he calls this one of my principles, unless all my propositions
be principles, as all his arguments are demonstrations. It
is indeed a conclusion which I have partly, and shall in the
sequel largely make good. In the mean time whether it be
principle or conclusion, let us see what is objected against it,
or what use is made of it: For <hi>I. S.</hi> says it is <hi>an improv'd
and a main position.</hi> But then he tells us, the reason of it
is, because <hi>No heretic had arisen in those days denying
those points, and so the Fathers set not themselves to
write expresly for them, but occasionally only.]</hi> Let us
consider what this is, <hi>no heretic had arisen in those days
denying these points:</hi> True, but many Catholics did, and the
reason why no heretics did deny those things was, because
neither Catholic nor heretic ever affirm'd them. Well! but
however, <hi>the Roman controvertists are frequent for cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them for divers points.</hi> Certainly not for making vows
to Saints; not for the worship of images; nor for the half Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
for these they do not frequently cite the Fathers of
the first 300. years: It may be not, <hi>but for the ground
of our faith, the Churches voice or tradition they
do, to the utter overthrow of the Protestant cause.</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:31"/>
They do indeed sometimes cite something from them for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and where ever the word <hi>tradition</hi> is in Scripture,
or the Primitive Fathers, they think it is an argument for
them, just as the Covenanters in the late wars, thought all
Scripture was their plea, where ever the word <hi>Covenant</hi>
was nam'd. But to how little purpose they pretend to take
advantage of any of the primitive Fathers speaking of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I shall endeavour to make apparent in an inquiry
made on purpose. <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> In the mean time it appears,
that this conclusion of mine was to very good purpose, and
in a manner, confess'd to be true in most instances; and
that it was so in all, was not intended by me.</p>
               <p>Well! but however it might be in the first three ages,
yet he observes that I said, that <hi>in the succeeding ages
secular interest did more prevail, and the writings of
the Fathers were vast and voluminous,</hi> and many things
more, that <hi>both sides eternally and inconfutably shall
bring sayings for themselves respectively.</hi> And is not
all this very true? He cannot deny it; but what then? why
then he says, <hi>I may speak out and say, all the Fathers
after the first three hundred years are not worth a straw
in order to decision or controversie; and the Fathers
of the first three hundred years spoke not of our points
in difference, and so there is a fair end of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and of my own Dissuasive too; for that part which
relies on them, which looks like the most authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
piece of it:</hi> There is no great hurt in this, If the
Fathers be gone, my Dissuasive may go too; it cannot easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
go in better company, and I shall take the less care of it,
because I have <hi>I. S.</hi> his word, that there is a part of it,
which relies upon the Fathers. But if the Fathers be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is fit we look after them, and see which way they go:
For if they go together (as in many things they do) they
are of very good use in order to decision of controversie; if
they go several ways, and consequently that Controvertists
may <hi>eternally and irrefutably bring sayings out of them


<pb facs="tcp:64671:31"/>
against one another,</hi> who can help it? No man can follow
them all; and then it must be tried by some other topic
which is best to follow; but then that topic by it self would
have been sufficient to have ended the Question. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
If a disputer of this world pretends to rely upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Fathers, he may by them be confuted, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd.
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to this, and
therefore if we perceive the Fathers have condemned do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
which they approve of, or approve what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
which we say in many articles is the case of that
Church, then the Dissuasive might be very useful, and so
might the Fathers too, for the condemnation of such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
in which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are by that touchstone
found too blame.</p>
               <p>And where as <hi>I. S.</hi> says, that the first three ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
medled not with the present controversies; it is
but partly true, for although many things are now adays
taught, of which they never thought, yet some of the errors
which we condemn were condemn'd then, very few indeed
by disputation, but not a few by positive sentence, and in
explications of Scripture, and rational discourses, and by
parity of case, and by Catechetical doctrines. For <hi>rectum
est Index sui &amp; obliqui;</hi> they have without thinking of
future controversies and new emergent heresies, said enough
to confute many of them when they shall arise. The great
use of the Fathers, especially of the first three hundred
years is to tell us what was first, to consign Scripture to us,
to convey the Creed, with simplicity and purity to preach
Christs Gospel, to declare what is necessary and what not:
And whether they be fallible or infallible, yet if we find
them telling and accounting the integrity of the Christian
faith, and treading out the paths of life; because they
are persons whose conversation, whose manner and time of
living, whose fame and Martyrdom, and the venerable
testimony of after-ages have represented to be very credible,
we have great reason to believe that alone to be the faith,


<pb facs="tcp:64671:32"/>
which they have describ'd, and consequently that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
comes in afterwards and is obtruded upon the world,
as it was not their way of going to heaven, so it ought not
to be ours. So that here is great use of the Fathers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
though they be not infallible, and therefore I wonder
at the prodigious confidence (to say no worse) of <hi>I. S.</hi> to dare
to say; that <hi>[as appears by the Dissuader the Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
neither acknowledge them infallible, nor useful,</hi>
Nay <hi>that this is my fourth Principle.]</hi> He that believes
Transubstantiation, can believe <hi>any thing;</hi> and he that
says this, dares say <hi>every thing;</hi> for as that is infinitely
impossible to sense and reason, so this is infinitely false in
his own Conscience and experience. And the words, which
in a few lines of his bold assertion he hath quoted out of
my book, confute him but too plainly. <hi>[He tells us,</hi> (so
saith <hi>I. S.) the Fathers are a good testimony of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
deliver'd from their Forefathers down to them,
of what the Church esteemed the way of salvation.]</hi>
Do not I also (though he is pleas'd to take no notice of it)
say, that although we acknowledge not the Fathers <hi>as the
Authors and finishers of our faith, yet we owne them
as helpers of our faith, and heirs of the doctrine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical:</hi>
That we make use of their testimonies as being
(as things now stand) to <hi>the sober and the moderate, the
peaceable and the wise, the best, the most certain, visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and tangible, most humble and satisfactory to them
that know well how to use it.</hi> Can he that says this, not
acknowledge the Fathers useful? I know not whether <hi>I. S.</hi>
may have any credit as he is one of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but as
he is a <hi>witness,</hi> no man hath reason to take his
word.</p>
               <p>But to the thing in question, Whatever we Protestants
think or say; yet <hi>I. S.</hi> saith <hi>[our constant and avowed
doctrine</hi> (meaning of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> is, <hi>that the
testimony of Fathers speaking of them properly as
such is infallible.</hi> If this be the avowed doctrine of the


<pb facs="tcp:64671:32"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Church, then I shall prove, that one of the
avowed doctrines of that Church is false. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I shall also prove that many of the most eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church, are not of that mind, and therefore
it is not the constant doctrine, as indeed amongst them few
doctrines are.</p>
               <p>1. It is false that <hi>the Testimony of the Fathers
speaking of them properly as such is infallible.</hi> For
<hi>God only is true, and every man a lyar;</hi> and since the
Fathers never pretended to be assisted by a supernatural mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
aide, or inspired by an infallible spirit; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
is so far beyond humane nature, and industry,
that the Fathers may be called <hi>Angels</hi> much rather than
<hi>infallible;</hi> for if they were assisted by an infallible spirit, what
hinders but that their writings might be Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
And if it be said they were assisted infallibly in some
things and not in all, it is said to no purpose; for unless it
be infallibly known where the infallibility resides, and what
is so certain as it cannot be mistaken, every man must tread
fearfully, for he is sure the Ice is broken in many places, and
he knows not where it will hold. It is certain <hi>S. Austin</hi>
did not think the Fathers before him to be infallible, when
it is plain that in many doctrines, as in the damnation of
infants dying Unbaptiz'd, and especially in questions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
in the disputes against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> about free will,
and predestination, without scruple he rejected the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of his predecessors. And when in a question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
himself and <hi>S. Hierom</hi> about <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and the
second chapter to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he was press'd with the
authority of six or seven <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers; he roundly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he gave no such honour to any writers of books,
but to the Scriptures, only as to think them not to have
erred;<note place="margin">Ep. S. Aug. ad Hierom. qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were prov'd by Scriptures, or probable reason. Not
because they thought so, but because he thought them

<pb facs="tcp:64671:33"/>
not of the same minde concerning his own works. And for
that <hi>S. Hierom</hi> hath given satisfaction to the world in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places of his own writings.<note n="*" place="margin">S. Hierom. l. 2. apelog. contr. Ruff Epist. 62. ad Theoph. Alex Epist. 65 ad Pammach. &amp; Ocean. &amp; Epist. 76. ad Tranquil. epist. 13. ad Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. &amp; praefat. in lib. de Hebr. nomin.</note> 
                  <hi>I suppose Origen is

the contrary.</hi> So that it is evident the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have no conceit of the infallibility of themselves or
others (the Prophets, and Apostles, and Evangelists only
excepted,) and therefore if this be an avowed doctrine of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, there is no oral tradition for it, no
first and self evident principle to prove it; and either the
Fathers are deceiv'd in saying they are fallible, or they
are not: If they be deceiv'd in saying so, then that suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proves that they can be deceiv'd, and therefore that
they are not infallible; but if they be not deceiv'd in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they are fallible; then it is certain that they are
fallible, because they say they are, and in saying so are not
deceiv'd. But then, if in this the Fathers are not
deceiv'd, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in one of her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
doctrines is deceiv'd, saying otherwise of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
than is true and contrary to what themselves, said
of themselves.</p>
               <p>But 2. If it be the avowed doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> (as <hi>I. S.</hi> says it is) yet I am sure it is not <hi>their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
doctrine.</hi> Certain it is <hi>S. Austin</hi> was not infallible,
for he retracted some things he had said; and in <hi>Gratians</hi>
time, neither <hi>S. Austin</hi> nor any of the Fathers were esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
infallible, and this appears in nine chapters together of
the ninth distinction of <hi>Gratians</hi> decree,<note place="margin">Dist. 9. Decret. cap. Nolo meis.</note> but because this
truth was too plain to serve the interest of the following
ages; the gloss upon cap. <hi>Nolo meis,</hi> tells us plainly, <hi>that
this was to be understood according to those times,
when the works of</hi> S. Austin <hi>and of the other holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were not authentic, but now all of them are
commanded to be held to the last title;</hi> and a marginal


<pb facs="tcp:64671:33"/>
note upon the gloss says, <hi>Scripta Sanctorum sunt ad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guem
observanda.</hi> So that here is plain variety, and
no constant oral tradition from <hi>S. Austins</hi> time down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that his and the fathers writings were infallible,
till <hi>Gratians</hi> time it was otherwise, and after him, till
the gloss was written. It is as <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>There is a
time for every thing under the Sun.</hi> There is a time in
which the writings of the Fathers are authentic, and a
time in which they are not: But then this is not setled, no
constant business. Now I would fain know whether <hi>Gratian</hi>
spake the sense of the Church of his age or no? If no, then the
Fathers were of one mind, and the Church of his age of a
contrary; and then which of them was infallible? But if
yea, then how comes the present Church to be of another
mind now? And which of the two ages that contradict each
other hath got the ball, which of them carries the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?
Well! however it come to pass; yet the truth is,
<hi>I. S.</hi> does wrong to his own Church, and they never decreed
or affirm'd the Fathers to be infallible. And therefore
the <hi>Glossator</hi> upon <hi>Gratian</hi> was an ignorant man, and his
gloss ridiculous, <hi>Ecce quales sunt decretorum glossato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
quibus tanta fides adhibetur;</hi> said <hi>A. Castor,</hi> and
<hi>Duns Scotus</hi> gave a good character of them; <hi>Mittunt
&amp; remittunt &amp; tandem nihil ad propositum.</hi> But the
mistake of this ignorant <hi>Glossator</hi> is apparent to be upon
the account of the words of <hi>Gelasius in dist. 15. cap. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta
Rom. Eccl.</hi> where when he had reckon'd divers of
the Fathers writings, which the Church receives; he hath
these words, <hi>Item Epistola B. Leonis Papae ad Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum
Episcopum C. P. destinatum, cujus textum aut
unum iota si quisquam idiota disputaverit, &amp; non eam
in omnibus venerabiliter acceperit, anathema fit</hi>
Now although this reaches not neer to infallibility, but
only to a <hi>non disputare,</hi> and a <hi>venerabiliter accipere,</hi>
and that by idiots only, and therefore can do <hi>I. S.</hi> no service,
yet this which <hi>Gelasius</hi> speaks of <hi>S. Leo</hi>'s Epistle to <hi>Flavia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:34"/>
the <hi>Glossator</hi> falsly applies to all the works of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
against the mind of the Fathers themselves quoted
by <hi>Gratian</hi> in the ninth distinction, and against the sense
of <hi>Gelasius</hi> himself in that very chapter which he refers
to in the fifteenth distinction. It may be <hi>I. S.</hi> had not so
much to say for his bold proposition as this it self comes
to, which if he had ever seen, he must needs have seen in
the same place very much to the contrary. But that not
only the Fathers themselves have taught him to speak

what hopes of escaping <hi>I. S.</hi> can have by his restrictive
terms <hi>[the testimony of Fathers speaking of them
properly as such]</hi> for besides that the words mean nothing,
and the testimony of Fathers is the testimony of <hi>Fathers
as such,</hi> or it is just nothing at all: Besides this I say, that
<hi>Aquinas</hi> affirms that their whole authority (and therefore
of Fathers as such) is only probable, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
not infallible. But this is so fond a proposition of
<hi>I. S.</hi> that I am asham'd to speak any more of it; and if he
were not very ignorant of what his Church holds,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. adv. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. c. 7.</note> he would

               <p>It is not therefore the constant doctrine of the <hi>Romanists,</hi>

Well! but how shall we know that the Fathers testimony,
is a testimony of <hi>Fathers speaking properly as such?</hi> for
this doughty Question we are to inquire after in the pursuit
of <hi>I. S.</hi> his mines and crackers: He says in two cases they
speak as Fathers. <hi>1. When they declare it the doctrine
of the present Church of their time. 2. When they
write against any man as an heretic, or his Tenet as
heresie.</hi> It seems then in these the Fathers testimony is
infallible. Let us try this, 1. All or any thing of this may
be done by Fathers supposed such, but really, not so: and if
it be not infallibly certain which are and which are not the
writings of the Fathers; we are nothing the neerer though
it were agreed, that the true Fathers testimony is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
Or 2. If the book alledged was the book of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretended, and not of an obscure or heretical person;
yet it may be the words are interpolated, or the testimony
some way or other corrupted; and then the testimony is not
infallible, when there is no absolute certainty of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
themselves or the records: and what causes there are
of rejecting very many, and doubting more; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in matters of present interest and Question of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and fallibility in too many, is known to every lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man, and confessed by writers of both sides. 2. It is
very seldom that any of the Fathers do use that expression
of saying, <hi>This</hi> or <hi>this is the doctrine of the Church;</hi>
and therefore if they speak as Fathers, never but when
these two cases happen; the writings of the Fathers will
be of very little use in <hi>I. S.'s</hi> way. 3. And yet after all this,
if we shall descend to instances <hi>I. S.</hi> will not dare to justifie
what he says. Was <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> infallible, when he
said that all Christians who were pure believers did believe
the Millenary doctrine? Certainly they were the Church,
for the others he says were such as denied the resurrection.
But was <hi>Gennadius</hi> or else <hi>S. Austin</hi> fathers; and they
infallible in the book <hi>de dogmatibus Ecclesiasticis,</hi> in
which he intends to give an account of the doctrine of the


<pb facs="tcp:64671:35"/>
Church; <hi>I. S.</hi> Seems to acknowledge it by affirming a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of that book to have been then <hi>de fide;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it had been oppos'd by very many of the fathers, he
had no reason to affirm, but upon the witness of <hi>Gennadius</hi>
putting it into his book of Ecclesiastical doctrines; and he
afterwards calls it the <hi>testimony of Gennadius deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doctrine of the Catholic Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 315.</note> It is there
said, <hi>that all men shall die</hi> (Christ only excepted) <hi>that
death might reign from Adam upon all. Hanc ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
maxima Patrum turba tradente suscepimus: This
account we have receiv'd from the tradition of the
greatest company of the Fathers.</hi> If this be a traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
delivered by the greatest number of the fathers, then
1. Tradition is not a sure rule of saith; for this tradition
is false, and expresly against Scripture: and 2. It follows
that Tradition was not then esteemed a sure rule of faith;
for although this was a tradition from so great a troop of
fathers (at he says it was) yet there were in his time, <hi>alii
aeque Catholici &amp; eruditi viri,</hi> others as good Catholics
and as learned, that believ'd (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> believ'd) that
<hi>we shall not all dye, but we shall all be chang'd;</hi> and
however it be; yet all that troop of fathers he speaks of,
from whence the tradition came, were not infallible, for
they were actually deceiv'd. Now this instance is of great
consideration and force, against <hi>I. S.</hi> his first and self evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
principle concerning oral tradition. For all that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fathers if the rule of faith had been only oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
would horribly have disturbed the pure current of
tradition, and of necessity must have prevailed in <hi>I. S.</hi>
his way, or at least the contrary (which is the truth, and
expresly affirm'd in Scripture) could never have had the
irrefragable testimony of oral tradition. But thanks be to
God, in this the Church adher'd to the surer word of
Prophecy, the Scripture prov'd the surer rule of faith.
But again <hi>S. Austin</hi> or <hi>Gennadius</hi> says, <hi>That after
Christs resurrection the souls of all the Saints are with


<pb facs="tcp:64671:35"/>
Christ, and that going forth from the body, they go to
Christ expecting the resurrection of their bodies.</hi> This
he delivers as the Ecclesiastical doctrine; and do the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of Purgatory believe him in this to be infallible? for
my part I think <hi>S. Austin</hi> is in the right; but I think <hi>I. S.</hi>
will not grant this to be the avowed and constant doctrine of
his Church.</p>
               <p>The second case, in which they speak as Fathers, is when
they write against any man as an heretic, or his tenet as
heresy. But this is so notoriously false, as nothing is
more; and it is infinitely confuted by all the Catalogues
and books of the fathers reckoning the heresies; where they
are pleased to call all opinions they like not, by the names
of heresy.<note place="margin">Haeres. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>Philastrius</hi> writes against them as heretics,
and puts them in his black Catalogue, who expounds that
of making man in the image and likeness of God, spoken of
in <hi>Genesis,</hi> to signifie the reasonable soul, and not rather
the Grace of the Holy Spirit. He also accounts them he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics
who rejected the <hi>LXX,</hi> and followed the translation
of <hi>Aquila,</hi> which in the Ancient Church was in great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Some there were who said that <hi>God hardned the
heart of Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Haeres. 77.</note> and these he calls heretics, and yet
this heresy is the very words of Scripture;<note place="margin">Haeres. 71.</note> and some
are reckon'd heretics for saying that the Deluge of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion</hi>
and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> was before <hi>Noahs</hi> flood. But more
consider able is that heresy,<note place="margin">Haeres. 74.</note> which affirm'd that <hi>Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into hell, and there preach'd to the detained,
that they who would confess him might be sav'd.</hi> Now
if <hi>Philastrius</hi> or any other writer of heretics, were in
this case infallible, what shall become of many of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
fathers who taught this now condemned doctrine.
So did <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Anastasius Sinaita,
S. Athanasius, S. Hierom, S. Ambrose,</hi> and divers others
of the most eminent fathers; and <hi>S. Austin</hi> affirm'd that
Christ did save some; but whether all the damned then or
no; he could not resolve <hi>Euodius</hi> who ask'd the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Jacob. Vsser<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> primat. Hibern. cap. de limbo PP.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:36"/>
That it was not lawful for Christians to swear at
all upon any account, was unanimously taught by S. <hi>Hilary,</hi>
and S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact,</hi>

no not <hi>cum exigitur jus-jurandum, aut cum
urget necessitas;</hi> and that it is <hi>crimen Gehenna dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
a damnable sin. Whether that was the doctrine of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in those days, I say not; but if it
were, why is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of a contrary judgement
now? If it were not, then a consenting testimony of many
fathers even of the greatest ranke, is no irrefragable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the truth, or Catholic tradition; and from so
great an union of such an authority, it was not very hard to
imagine, that the opinion might have become Catholic;
from a lesser spring greater streams have issued; but it is
more than probable, that there was no Catholic oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
concerning this main and concerning article;
and I am sure <hi>I.</hi> S. will think, that all these fathers
were not only fallible, but deceiv'd actually in this
point.</p>
               <p>By these few instances we may plainly see, what little
of infallibility there is in the fathers writings, when they
write against heretics or heresies, or against any article;
and how then shall we know that the fathers are at all,
or in any case infallible? I know not from any thing more
that is said by <hi>I. S.</hi> But this I know, that many chief men
of his side do speak so slightly, and undervalue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
so pertly, that I fear it will appear that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
have better opinion of them, and make better use
of the Fathers than themselves.<note place="margin">Praefat. in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch.</note> What think we of the
saying of Cardinal <hi>Cajetan? If you chance to meet

is given by the whole current of the Holy Doctors, I
desire the Readers that they would not too hastily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it.</hi> And again, <hi>Let no man therefore reject a new
exposition of any passage of Scripture, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

they will seem to be void of good sense.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 110.</note> And again,
<hi>there is cause why the authority of certain Fathers
should be objected, for they can say nothing but what

And <hi>Maldonate</hi> does expresly reject the exposition which

and <hi>Theophylact</hi> of the same heresy. And <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius

he had rather believe one single <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Epist. ad Rom. c. 14.</note> than a thousand
<hi>Augustines, Hierom's</hi> or <hi>Gregories.</hi> I shall not need
any further to instance how the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
many things against the general doctrines of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
as in the placing images in Churches; the denying
of the Eucharist to Infants; the not including the Blessed
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in the general evil of Mankind in the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, denying the Chalice to the Laity,
and Priests not officiating, the beatification and Divine
vision of Saints before the day of judgment. If it were
not notorious, and sometimes confessed, that these things
are contrary to the sense of a troop of fathers, there might
be some excuse made for them, who give them good
words, and yet reject their authorities so freely, that it
sometimes seems to pass into scorn. But now it appears
to be to little purpose,<note place="margin">Sess. 4.</note> that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> enjoyns


<pb facs="tcp:64671:37"/>
her Clergy, that they offer not to expound Scripture against
the unanimous consent of the fathers; for (though this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
not to the height of <hi>I. S.</hi> his saying, it is their
avowed and constant doctrine, that they are infallible,
but <hi>ad coercenda petulantia ingenia)</hi> the contrary is done
and avowed every day. And as the fathers prov'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
fallible, both <hi>as such</hi> in writing against here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
and in testifying concerning the Churches doctrine
in their age; so in the interpretations of Scripture, in
which although there be no Universal consent of Fathers in
any interpretation of Scripture, concerning which questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
mov'd; so the best and most common consent that is,
men of great note recede from it with the greater boldness,
by how much they hope to raise to themselves the greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
for wit and learning.<note place="margin">Sess. 11.</note> And therefore although in
the sixth General Council, the <hi>Origenists</hi> were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for bringing in interpretations differing from those
that went before them; and in the Synod in <hi>Trullo</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Canon. 19. ex divinâ scripturâ Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentes intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentias.</note>, all Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of souls were commanded to interpret Scriptures, so
as not to transgress the bounds and tradition of the fathers;
and the same was the way taken in the Council of <hi>Vienna,</hi>
and commanded since in the <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth,
and at last in <hi>Trent,</hi> yet all this was but good advice,
which when the following Doctors pretended to follow, they
nevertheless still took their liberty, and went their own
way, and if they followed some of the Fathers, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
from many others; for none of them esteem'd the
way infallible; but they that did not think their own
way better, left their own reason and followed their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But of late, <hi>knowledge is increased,</hi> at least ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
writers think so; and though the Ancient interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were more honoured,<note place="margin">In Epist. ad Rom. 5 disp. 51 p. 468.</note> than new; yet <hi>Salmeron</hi> says
plainly, <hi>that the younger Doctors are better sighted and
more perspicacious.</hi> And the Question being about the
conception of the Blessed Virgin, without original sin; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which a multitude of fathers are brought: the Jesuit


<pb facs="tcp:64671:37"/>
answers the argument with the words in <hi>Exodus 23. Thou
shalt not follow a multitude to sin.</hi> And to the same
purpose <hi>S. Austin</hi> answered the <hi>Donatists.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ntr. Donat.</note> But of this
I shall afterwards have occasion to speak more particularly.
In the mean time it must needs be acknowledged, that the
Protestants cannot more slight the Fathers, than the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
do, and divers other Doctors of the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> though I think both of them do equally think them
to be fallible.</p>
               <p>Well! but at last, of what use are the Fathers to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
in their writings? And what use do I or can I make
of them in my Dissuasive? First for the Protestants, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> can very well account by her Canon, in
which she follows the Council in <hi>Trullo,</hi> and the sixth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Synod, and ties her Doctors, as much as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> does, to expound Scriptures according to the
sense of the Ancient Fathers; and indeed it is the best way
for most Men, and it is of great use to all men so to do.
For the Fathers were good men and learned; and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and partiality, and error had not then invaded the
world so much, as they have since done. <hi>The Papacy,</hi>
that <hi>great fountain of error and servile learning,</hi> had
not so debaucht the world, and all that good which can be
supposed could be ministred by the piety and learning of so
many excellent persons, all that we can use, and we do
make use of it upon all just occasions. They speak reason
and religion in their writings, and when they do so, we
have reason to make use of the good things, which by their
labours God intended to convey to us. They were better
than other men, and wiser than most men, and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is not at all contemptible, but in most things highly
to be valued: And is at the worst a very probable induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Are not the books of the <hi>Canonists</hi> and <hi>Casuists</hi>
in a manner little else than a heap of quotations out of
their predecessors writings? Certainly we have much more
reason to value the authority of the Ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:64671:38"/>
And now since <hi>I. S.</hi> requires an account from me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and thinks I have no right to use them;<note place="margin">Pag. 312.</note> I shall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him an account of this also. But first let us see what
his charge is. He says indeed I tell him, that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are a good testimony of the doctrine delivered
from their Forefathers down to them of what the
Church esteemed the way of salvation.</hi> I did tell them
so indeed; and in the same place I said, <hi>that we admit the
Fathers, as admirable helps for the understanding of
the Scriptures.</hi> I told them both these things together;
and therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> may blush with shame for telling us,
that it <hi>appears by the Dissuader that the Protestants do
not acknowledge the Fathers infallible or useful.</hi> But
then in what degree of usefulness the Fathers are admitted
by us, we may perceive by the instances, of which the one
being the interpretation of Scriptures, it is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their great variety and contrariety of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we do not admit them as infallible, but yet of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
use; so in the testimony which they give of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of their forefathers concerning the way of salvation,
we give as great credit as can be due to any relator, except
him that is infallible.

               <p>Nay we go something further; for although in asserting
and affirming, in teaching and delivering <hi>positively,</hi> we
do believe them with great veneration, but not without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and inquiry; yet when we make use of them <hi>in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
way,</hi> we find use of them, much nearer to infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
than all the <hi>demonstrations of surefooting.</hi> For
the argument lies thus:<note place="margin">Chap. 1. Sect. 1: Dissuasive.</note> 
                  <hi>In the ages succeeding the three
first, secular interest did much prevail, the writings
of the Fathers were vast and voluminous, full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
and ambiguous senses, fitted to their own


<pb facs="tcp:64671:38"/>
times and questions, full of proper opinions and such
variety of sayings, that both sides eternally and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futably
shall bring sayings for themselves respectively.</hi>
This ground I lay of the ensuing argument, and upon this
I build immediately; That <hi>things being thus,</hi> that is,
<hi>in the ages succeeding the first three</hi> (the primitive and
purest) the case being so vastly changed, the books so vast,
the words so many, the opinions so proper, the contrariety
so apparent; it is very possible that two litigants shall from
them pretend words serving their distinct <hi>hypothesis,</hi>
especially when they come to wrangle about the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ambiguous sayings, and of things so disputed there
can be no end, no determination. <hi>And therefore it will
be impossible</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors <hi>to conclude from
the sayings of a number of Fathers, (viz.</hi> in the latter
and succeeding ages of the Church; for of them only the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
does treat) <hi>that their doctrine which they
would prove thence was the Catholic doctrine of the
Church.</hi> And the reason of this is deriv'd from the ground
I laid for the argument, because these Fathers are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>gens contra gentem;</hi> and sometimes one man
against himself, and sometimes changing his doctrine, and
sometimes speaking in heat, and disputing fiercely, and
striving by all means to prevail and conquer heretics; and
therefore a testimony of many of them consenting, is not a
sufficient argument to prove a doctrine Catholic; unless all
consent in this case, the major part will not prove a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
Catholic: Of this I have given divers instances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and shall add more in the Section of Tradition;
for the present I shall only recite the words of the Bishop of
the <hi>Canaries</hi> (a great Man amongst them) to attest what
I say.<note place="margin">Melch. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

single point be proved by each single Father, as <hi>I. S.</hi> most
weakly would infer; for that indeed is morally impossible;
but that when the Fathers of the later ages of whom we
speak are divided in sentence and interest, neither from
the lesser number nor yet from the greater can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any Catholic consent. <hi>Ecclesia Universalis
nunquam errat quia nunquam tota errat;</hi> it is not to
be imputed to the Universal Church, unless all of it agree,
and by this <hi>Abulensis</hi> asserts the indefectibility of the
Church of God;<note place="margin">Abulens. praef. in Matth. q. 3.</note> it never erres because all of it does never
erre.</p>
               <p>And therefore here is wholly a mistake; for to prove
a point <hi>de fide</hi> from the authority of the Fathers, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
an Universal consent. Not that it is expected that
every mans hand that writes should be at it, or every
mans vote that can speak should be to it, for this were
unreasonable; but an Universal consent is so required,
that is, that there be no dissent by any Fathers equally
Catholic and reputed. <hi>Reliquis licet paucioribus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamantibus;</hi>
if others though the fewer number do
dissent, then the Major part is not testimony sufficient.
And therefore when <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi>
of <hi>Walden</hi> affirmed, that the consent of the Major part
of Fathers from the Apostles downwards is Catholic;
<hi>Canus</hi> expounds their meaning to be, in case that the
few Dissentients have been condemned by the Church,
then the Major part must carry it; Thus when some of
the Fathers said that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was the Holy Ghost,
here the Major part carried it, because the opinion of
the Minor part was condemned by the Church. But
let me add one caution to this, that it may pass the
better. Unless the Church of that age, in which a Minor
part of Fathers contradicts a greater, do give testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in behalf of the Major part, (which thing I think never


<pb facs="tcp:64671:39"/>
was done, and is not indeed easie to be supposed) though
the following ages reject the Minor part, it is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that the doctrine of the Major part was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
doctrine of that age. It might by degrees become
Universal, that was not so at first; and therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the whole present age do agree, that is, unless of all
that are esteemed Orthodox there be a present consent,
this broken consent is not an infallible testimony of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicism
of the doctrine. And this is plain in the case of
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Fathers,<note place="margin">I. S. p. 3. 4.</note> denying the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of heretics to be valid: Supposing a greater number
of Doctors did at that time believe the contrary; yet
their testimony is no competent proof, that the Church
of that age was of their judgement; No, although
the succeeding ages did condemn the opinion of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;</hi>
for the question now is not whether S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
doctrine be true or no, but whether it was the Catholic
doctrine of the Church of that age. It is answered, it
was not, because many Catholic Doctors of that age
were against it, and for the same reason, neither was
their doctrine the Catholic, because as wise and as
learned men opposed them in it; and it is a frivolous
pretence to say, that <hi>the contrary (viz.</hi> to <hi>S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
doctrine) <hi>was found and defin'd to be the faith
and the sense of the Church;</hi> for suppose it was, but
then it became so by a new and later definition, not by
the oral tradition of that present age; and therefore this
will do <hi>I. S.</hi> no good, but help to overthrow his fond
<hi>hypothesis.</hi> This or that might be a true doctrine, but
not the doctrine of the then Catholic Church, in which the
Catholics were so openly and with some earnestness divided.
And therefore it was truly said in the Dissuasive, <q>That
the clear saying of one or two of those Fathers, truly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by us to the contrary, will certainly prove that
what many of them (suppose it) do affirm, and which


<pb facs="tcp:64671:40"/>
but two or three as good Catholics do deny, was not then
a matter of faith or a doctrine of the Church: If it
had, these dissentients publicly owning and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that doctrine, would have been no Catholics but
Heretics.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Against this <hi>I. S.</hi> hath a pretty sophism, or if you
please let it pass for one of his demonstrations.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>If one
or two denying a point, which many (others) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
argues that it is not of faith; then</hi> a fortiori,
<hi>if one or two affirm it to be of faith, it argues it is
of faith, though many others deny it.</hi> This conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is so far from arising from the antecedent, that
in the world nothing destroys it more. For, because
the denial of one or two argues a doctrine is not Catholic
though affirm'd by many, therefore it is impossible that
the affirmation of one or two (when there be many dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients)
should sufficiently prove a doctrine to be Catholic.
The antecedent supposes that true which therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the consequent to be false; for therefore the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
a thing to be Catholic, by two or three, or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
does not prove it to be so, unless all consent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the denying it to be Catholic (which the antecedent
supposes) by two or three, is a good testimony that it is
not Catholic. <hi>I. S.</hi> his argument is like this; If the
absence of a few makes the company not full, then the
presence of a few when more are absent, <hi>a fortiori</hi> makes
the company to be full. But because I must say nothing
but what must be reduc'd to grounds, I have to shew the
stupendious folly of this argument, a self evident Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and that is, <hi>Bonum,</hi> and so, <hi>Verum,</hi>
is <hi>ex integra causa, malum ex qualibet particulari;</hi>
and a cup is broken, if but one piece of the lip be broken;
but it is not whole, unless it be whole all over. And
much more is this true, in a question concerning the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
of consent, or of tradition. For <hi>I. S.</hi> does


<pb facs="tcp:64671:40"/>
praevaricate in the Question, which is, <hi>whether the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
be Universal if the particulars be not agreed;</hi>
and he instead of that thrusts in another word which is no
part of the Question: for so he changes it, by saying, <hi>the
dissent of a few does not make but that the article is a
point of faith;</hi> for though it cannot be supposed a point
of faith, when any number of the Catholic Fathers do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to believe a proposition contrary to it; yet possibly it
will by some of his side be said to be a point of faith <hi>upon
other accounts;</hi> as upon <hi>the Churches definition,</hi> or
the <hi>authority of plain Scriptures,</hi> but this will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to <hi>I. S.</hi> his <hi>hypothesis;</hi> for if a part of the Catholic
Fathers did deliver the contrary, there was no irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable,
Catholic, Oral tradition of the Church, when so
considerable a part of the Church delivered the contrary as
their own doctrine, which is not to be imagin'd they would
have done, if the consent of the Church of that age was
against it. And if we can suppose this case that one part
of the Fathers should say, <hi>this is the doctrine of the
Church,</hi> when another part of the Fathers are of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
judgment, either they did not say true, and then the
Fathers testimony, speaking as witnesses of the doctrine of
the Church of their age, is not infallible, or if they did say
true, yet their testimony, was not esteemed sufficient; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the other Fathers who must needs know it, if it was
the Catholic doctrine of the Church then, do not take it for
truth or sufficient. And that Maxime which was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that <hi>a Major part of voices
was sufficient for decreeing in a matter of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but that a decree of faith could not be made, if a
considerable part did contradict,</hi> relies upon the same
reason; faith is every mans duty, and every mans concern,
and every mans learning; and therefore it is not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that any thing can be an article of faith, in which a
number of wise and good men are at difference, either as


<pb facs="tcp:64671:41"/>
                  <hi>Doctors,</hi> or as <hi>witnesses.</hi> And of this we have a great
testimony from <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Common. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>In ipsa item
Ecclesia magnopere curandum est, ut id teneamus
quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum
est: hoc est enim verè propriéque Catholicum.</hi> Not
that which a part of the Fathers, but that which is said
every where, always, and by all, that is truly and properly
Chatholic; and this (says he) <hi>is greatly to be taken care of
in the Catholic Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all these premisses it will follow, that the Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
did, or might to very good purpose, make use of the
Fathers; and if I did there or shall in the following Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make it appear, that in such an age of the Ancient
Church, the doctrines which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this
day imposes on the world as articles of faith, were not then
accounted articles of faith, but either were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against, or not reckoned in their Canon and Confessions,
it will follow that either they can make new articles of
faith, or at least cannot pretend these to be articles of faith
upon the stock of Oral Catholic tradition; for this cannot
be at all, if the Catholic Fathers were (though Unequally)
divided in their testimony.</p>
               <p>The rest of <hi>I. S.</hi> his last Way or Mine is but bragging, and
indeed this whole Appendix of his is but the dregs of his
<hi>sure-footing,</hi> and gives but very little occasion of useful
and material discourse. But he had formerly promised
that he would give an account of My relying on Scripture,
and here was the place reserved for it; but when he comes
to it, it is nothing at all, but a reviling of it, calling of
it <hi>a bare letter Unsens't, outward characters, Ink
thus figur'd in a book;</hi> but whatsoever it is, he calls it
my <hi>main, most fundamental, and in a manner my only
principle;</hi> though he according to his usual method of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what comes next, had said before that I had <hi>no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
and that <hi>I had many Principles.</hi> All that he adds


<pb facs="tcp:64671:41"/>
afterwards is nothing but the same talk over again concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fathers, of which I have given an account I hope
full enough; and I shall add something more when I come
to speak concerning the justification of the grounds of the
Protestant and Christian religion. Only that I may be out
of <hi>I. S.</hi> his debt, I shall make it appear that he and his party
are the men that go upon no grounds, that in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> there is <hi>no sure-footing,</hi> no certain acknowledged
rule of faith; but while they call for an assent above the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and necessity of the thing, they have no warrant beyond
the greatest Uncertainty, and cause their people to wander
(that I may borrow <hi>I. S.</hi> his expression) <hi>in the very sphere
of contingency.</hi>

though it be acknowledged by the

1. Because it is imperfect and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

matters of Faith. 2. Because it is not sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
any that shall be questioned: not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its authority and truth is to be determin'd by

its sense and meaning must be found out by
something after it. And not he that writes or speaks,

Scripture no more is to rule us, then <hi>matter</hi> made the
world: until something else gives it form and life,
and motion and operative powers, it is but <hi>iners massa,</hi>
not so much as a clod of earth. And they, who speak
so much of the obscurity of Scripture, of the seeming

contradictions in it, of the variety of readings, and the
mysteriousness of its manner of delivery, can but little
trust that obscure, dark, intricate, and at last, imperfect
book, for a perfect clear Rule. But I shall not need to
drive them out of this Fort, which they so willingly
of themselves quit. If they did acknowledge Scripture
for their Rule, all Controversies about this, would be
at an end, and we should all be agreed: but because
they do not, they can claim no title here.</p>
                  <p>That which they pretend to be the infallible Judge,

is <hi>the Church;</hi> and she is a rock; <hi>the pillar and ground of

they have by this Confidence, will appear by
many considerations.</p>

<hi>Is there not a Convocation or an Assembly called
for this</hi> Plutus? Now by <hi>Translation</hi> this word is us'd
amongst Christians to signifie <hi>all them who out of the
whole mass of mankind are called and come, and are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together by the voice and call of God, to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God through Jesus Christ, and the participation
of eternal good things to follow:</hi> So that, <hi>The Church</hi> is
<hi>a Company of men and women professing the saving do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Jesus Christ.</hi> This is the Church <hi>in sensu forensi,</hi>
and in the sight of men; But because <hi>glorious things
are spoken of the city of God;</hi> the Professors of Christs
Doctrine are but imperfectly and inchoatively the


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64671:43"/>
Church of God; but they who are indeed holy and
obedient to Christs laws of faith and manners; that
live according to his laws, and walk by his example;
these are truly and perfectly <hi>the Church,</hi> and they
have this signature, <hi>God knoweth who are his.</hi> These
are the Church of God in the eyes and heart of God.
For the Church of God are the body of Christ; but the
meer profession of Christianity makes no man a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christ; <hi>Nither circumcision nor uncircumcision
availeth any thing in Christ Jesus,</hi> nothing <hi>but a new
creature;</hi> nothing but <hi>a faith working by love;</hi> and
<hi>keeping the Commandements of God.</hi> Now they that
do this are not known to be such, by Men; but they are
onely known to God; and therefore it is in a true sense
<hi>the invisible Church;</hi> not that there are two Churches,
or two Societies, in separation from each other; or that
one can be seen by men, and the other cannot: for then
either we must run after the Church, whom we ought
not to imitate; or be blind in pursuit of the other that
can never be found; and our eyes serve for nothing
but to run after false fires. No, these two Churches
are but one Society; the one is within the other, <hi>They
walk together to the house of God as friends, they take
sweet Counsel together,</hi> and eat the bread of God in
common: but yet though the men be visible, yet that
quality and excellency by which they are constituted
Christs members and distinguish'd from meer Professors
and outsides of Christians, this, I say, is not visible.
All that really and heartily serve Christ <hi>in abdito,</hi> do
also profess to do so; they serve him in the secret of
the heart, and in the secret chamber, and in the publick
Assemblies, unless by an intervening cloud of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they be for a while hid, and made less conspicuous:
but the invisible Church <hi>ordinary and regularly</hi> is part
of the visible, but yet that onely part that is the true
one; and the rest but by denomination of law, and in


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64671:44"/>
common speaking are the Church: not in mystical
union, not in proper relation to Christ, they are not the
House of God, not the Temple of the Holy Ghost,
not the members of Christ; and <hi>no man can deny this.</hi>
Hypocrites are not Christs servants, and therefore not
Christs members, and therefore no part of the Church
of God, but improperly and equivocally, as a dead
man is a man; all which is perfectly summ'd up in
those words of S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De doctr. Christ. lib. 3. cap 22</note> saying, that the body of Christ
is not <hi>bipartitum,</hi> it is not a double body. <hi>Non enim

All that are Christs body shall reign with Christ

the Devil, are the synagogue of Satan, and <hi>of such</hi> is

he is a Jew that is one inwardly.</hi> Now if any part of
mankind will agree to call the universality of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
by the title of the <hi>Church,</hi> they may if they will;
any word, by consent, may signifie any thing: but if by
<hi>Church</hi> we mean that Society which is really joyn'd
to Christ, which hath receiv'd the holy Spirit, which
is heir of the Promises, and the good things of God,
which is the body of which Christ is head; then the
invisible part of the visible Church, that is, the true
servants of Christ onely are the <hi>Church;</hi> that is, to
them onely appertains the spirit, and the truth, the
promises, and the graces, the privileges and advantages
of the Gospel: to others they appertain, as the promise
of pardon does; that is, when they have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
capable.</p>
                  <p>For since it is plain and certain, that Christs promise
of giving the spirit to his Apostles was meerly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 15, 16.</note>
If they did love him, If they did keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
Since it is plainly affirmed by the Apostle,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64671:44"/>
that by reason of wicked lives men and women did
turn Apostates from the faith, since nothing in the
world does more quench the spirit of wisdom and of
God than an impure life; it is not to be suppos'd that
<hi>the Church,</hi> as it signifies <hi>the Professors</hi> onely of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
can have an infallible spirit of truth. If the
Church of Christ have an indefectibility, then it must
be that which is in the state of grace, and the Divine
favour. They whom God does not love, cannot fall
from Gods love; but the faithful onely and obedient
are beloved of God: others may believe rightly; but
so do the Devils who are no parts of the Church, but
Princes of <hi>Ecclesia Malignantium;</hi> and it will be a
strange proposition which affirms any one to be of the
Church for no other reason but such as qualifies the
Devil to be so too. For there is no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Devils faith and the faith of a man that lives
wickedly; but that there is hopes the wicked man
may by his faith be <hi>converted</hi> to holiness of life, and
consequently be a member of Christ and the Church;
which the Devils never can be. <hi>To be converted</hi> from
Gentilism, or Judaism to the Christian faith is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing; but it is therefore so excellent, because
that is Gods usual way by that faith to <hi>convert</hi> them
unto God, from their vain conversation unto holiness.
That was the <hi>Conversion</hi> which was designed by the
preaching of the Gospel; of which, to believe meerly,
was but the entrance and introduction.</p>
                  <p>Now besides the evidence of the thing it self and
the notice of it in Scripture;<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> let me observe, that this
very thing is in it self a part of the article of faith; for
if it be asked <hi>What is the Catholick Church?</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed defines it; it is <hi>Communio Sanctorum, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the holy Catholick Church,</hi> that is, <hi>the Communion of
Saints,</hi> the conjunction of all them who heartily serve
God through Jesus Christ; the one is indeed exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

of the other, as that which is plainer is explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

Others it is certain are so said to be in the House of
God, that they do not pertain to the structure of the
house, nor to the society of fructifying and peace-making
justice, but are as chaff in the wheat. For
we cannot deny that they are in the house, the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saying, <hi>That in a great house there are

the Gospel are the propriety of the Godly; so they
only are the Church of God, of which glorious things
are spoken, and it will be vain to talk of the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of God's Church: the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors either must
confess it Subjected here, that is, in the Church in this

the Church (in the sense now explicated) which is the
<hi>pillar and ground of truth;</hi> but this is not the sense of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore from hence they
refusing to have their learning, can never pretend wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they can be Infalliby directed.</p>
                  <p>We have seen what is the true meaning of the

                  <p>1. Therefore, by Church sometimes they mean the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
whole body of them that profess Christianity; <hi>Greges

their Flocks, all over the world, upon whom the name
of Christ is called, whether they be dead in sins, or
alive in the spirit, whether good Christians or false
hypocrites: but all the number of the Baptized, except
Excommunicates that are since cut off, make this body.</p>
                  <p>Now the word <hi>Church,</hi> I grant may and is given to
them, by way of supposition and legal presumption;
as a Jury of twelve men, are called, <hi>Good men and true:</hi>
that is, they are not known to be otherwise, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
presum'd to be such: And they are the Church in
all humane accounts; that is, they are the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all that profess the name of Christ; of whom
every particular that is not known to be wicked, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
to be good; and therefore is still part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Church, in which are the wheat and the tares:
and they are bound up in Common by the Union of
Sacraments and external rites,<note place="margin">De doctr. Christ. lib. 3. c. 32.</note> name, and profession, but
by nothing else. This Doctrine is well explicated by 
S. <hi>Austin</hi> [<q>That is not the body of Christ which shall not
reign with him for ever.</q> And yet we must not say it
is bipartite; but it is either true or mixt, or it is either
true, or counterfeit; or some such thing. <q>
                        <hi>For not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 
in eternity, but even now, hypocrites are not to be
said to be with Christ, although they may seem to be of
his Church.</hi> But the Scripture speaks of those and these
as if they were both of one body, <hi>propter temporalem

                     </q> they
are only combin'd by a temporal mixtion, and united
by the common use of the Sacraments.] And this, to
my sense, all the Churches of the world seem to say;
for when they excommunicate a person, then they
throw him <hi>out of the Church;</hi> meaning, that all his
being in the Church of which they could take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
is but by the Communion of Sacraments and
external society.<note place="margin">Imped ri non debet fides aut charitas nostra, ut, quoniam zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zania esse in Ecclesiâ cerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ipsi de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiâ receda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must depart; because although a better union with


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64671:47"/>
Christ and one another is most necessary, yet even this
cannot, ought not, to be neglected; for by the outward,
the inward is set forward and promoted: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to depart from the external communion of the
Church upon pretence that the wicked are mingled
with the godly, is foolish and unreasonable; for by
such departing,<note place="margin">Scil. ep. 51. edit. Rigaltianae.</note> a man is not sure he shall depart from
all the wicked, but he is sure he shall leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the good, who are mingled in the common
Mass with the wicked, or else, all that which we call
<hi>the Church</hi> is wicked. And what can such men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to themselves of advantage, when they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
forsake the society of the good, for an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
departure from the wicked; and after all the care
they can take, they leave a society in which are some
intemperate, or many worldly men, and erect a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
for ought they know, of none but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites?</p>
                  <p>So that which we call the Church is <hi>permixta Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia,</hi>
as S. <hi>Austin</hi> is content it should be called, <hi>a
mixt Assembly;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vbi suprà.</note> and for this mixture sake, under the
cover and knot of external communion, the Church,
that is, all that company, is esteemed one body; and
the appellatives are made in common, and so are the
addresses, and offices and ministeries: because, of those
that are not now, some will be good; and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that are evil, are undiscernably so; and in that
communion are the ways, and ministeries, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of being good; and above all, in that society
are all those that are really good; therefore it is no
wonder, that we call this <hi>Great mixtion</hi> by the name
of <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> or the Church: But then, since the Church
hath a more sacred Notion, it is the spouse of Christ, his
dove, his beloved, his body, his members, his temple,
his house in which he loves to dwell, and which shall
dwell with him for ever; and this Church is known,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64671:48"/>
and discern'd, and lov'd by God, and is United unto
Christ: therefore although, when we speak of all
the acts and duties, of the judgments and nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
of outward appearances and accounts of law,
we call the mixt Society by the name of <hi>the Church.</hi>
Yet when we consider it in the true, proper, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
meaning, by the intention of God, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing, and the Entercourses between God
and his Church; all the promises of God, the Spirit of
God, the life of God, and all the good things of God
are peculiar to the Church of God, in God's sense, in
the way in which he owns it, that is, as it is holy, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto Christ, like to him and partaker of the Divine
nature. The other are but a heap of men keeping
good Company, calling themselves by a good name,
managing the external parts of Union and Ministery;
but because they otherwise belong not to God, the
promises no otherwise belong to them, but as they may,
and when they *<note place="margin">

notion and definition: the next inquiry is to be,
What certainty there is of finding truth in this Church,
and in what sense and meaning it is, that in the Church
of God we shall be sure to find it.</p>
                  <p>Of the Church in the first sense,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>6.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms; it is
<hi>the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> He spake it of the


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64671:48"/>
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or the Holy Catholick Church over
the world; for there is the same reason of one and all;
if it be, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>Ecclesia Dei vivi,</hi> if it be
united to the head Christ Jesus, every Church is as
much the <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> as all the Church;
which that we may understand rightly, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that what is commonly called <hi>the Church,</hi> is but
<hi>Domus Ecclesiae verae,</hi> as the <hi>Ecclesia vera</hi> is <hi>Domus Dei:</hi>
it is the School of Piety, the place of institution and
discipline. Good and bad dwell here; but God onely
and his Spirit dwells with the good. They are all
taught in the Church; but the good onely are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
taught by God, by an infallible Spirit, that is, by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which neither can deceive nor be deceived, and
therefore by him the good, and they onely, are lead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all saving truth; and these are the men that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the truth in holiness; without this society, the
truth would be hidden and held in Unrighteousness;
so that all good men, all particular Congregations of
good men, who upon the foundation Christ Jesus
build the superstructure of a holy life, <hi>are the pillar and
ground of truth;</hi> that is, they support and defend the
truth, they follow and adorn the truth; which truth
would in a little time be suppress'd, or obscur'd,
or varied, or conceal'd, and mis-interpreted, if the
wicked onely had it in their conduct. That is: Amongst
good men we are most like to find the ways of
peace and truth, all saving truth, and the proper
spiritual advantages and loveliness of truth. Now
then, this does no more relate to all Churches,
then to every Church, God will no more leave or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
any one of his faithful servants, then he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all the world. And therefore here the Notion of
<hi>Catholick</hi> is of no use; for the Church is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints,</hi> where-ever it be, or may be; and
that this Church is Catholick, it does not mean by any


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64671:49"/>
distinct existence; but by comprehension and actual
and potential inclosure of all Communions of holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>in the unity of the spirit, and in the band of peace;</hi>
that is, both externally and internally: <hi>Externally</hi>
means the common use of the Symbol and Sacraments;
for they are the band of peace; but the unity of the
Spirit is the peculiar of the Saints, and is the internal
confederation and conjunction of the members of
Christs body in themselves, and to their head. And by
the Energy of this state, where-ever it happens to be,
all the blessings of the Spirit are entail'd; every man
hath his share in it, he shall never be left or forsaken,
and the Spirit of God will never depart from him; as
long as he remains in, and is of the Communion of Saints.
But this promise is made to him onely as he is part of
this Communion, that is, of the body of Christ;
<hi>Membrum divulsum,</hi> if a limb be cut off from the
union of the body, it dies. No man belongs to God but
he that is of this Communion; but therefore the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Communion is, the more abundance of the Spirit
they shall receive; as there is more wisdom in many
wise men, than in a few: and since every single Church
or Convention receives it in the vertue of the whole
Church, that is, in conjunction with the body of
Christ; it is the whole body to whom this appellative
belongs, that she is the <hi>pillar and ground of truth.</hi> But
as every member receives life and nourishment, and is
alive, and is defended and provided for, by the head
and stomach, as truly and really as the whole body:
so it is in the Church; every member preserves the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
truth, and every member lives unto God, and so
long as they do so they shall never be forsaken by the

man supposes that <hi>Attalus</hi> was infallible; but so it is
in the case of every <hi>particular Church</hi> as really as of <hi>the
Catholick,</hi> that is, as to all Churches; for that is the
meaning of the word <hi>Catholick;</hi> not that it signifies a
distinct being from a particular Church; and if taken
abstractly, nothing is effected by the word; but if taken
distributively, then it is useful, and material, for it
signifies, that in every Congregation <hi>where two or three
are gathered in the name of Christ, God is in the midst of
them</hi> with his blessing and with his Spirit; it is so <hi>in all
the Churches of the Saints,</hi> and in all of them, (as long
as they remain such) the truth and faith is certainly
preserv'd. But then that in the Apostolical Creed the
Church is recommended under the notion of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
it is of great use and excellent mysterie, for by it
we understand that in all ages there is, and in all places
there may be a Church or Collection of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
and this Catholick Church cannot fail; that is, all
particular Churches shall not fail; for still it is to be
observed, there is no Church Catholick really distinct
from all particular Churches; and therefore there is no
promise made to a Church in the capacitie of being
Catholick or Universal; for that which hath no distinct
Being can have no distinct Promises, no distinct capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
but the promises are made to all Churches and
to every Church: onely there is this in it, if any


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64671:50"/>
Church of one denomination shall be cut off, other
branches shall stand by faith and still be in the vine:
The Church of God cannot be without Christ their
head, and the head will not suffer his body to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Thus I understand the meaning of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
being <hi>the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> Just as
we may say, Humane understanding, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of mankind, is the pillar and ground of
true Philosophy: but there is no such abstracted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as Humane understanding, distinct from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of all individual men. Every Universal is
but an intentional or notional Being: so is the word
<hi>Catholick</hi> relating to the Church, if it be understood
as something separated from all particular Churches;
and I do not find that it is any other ways us'd in
Scripture than in the distributive sense. So S. <hi>Paul,
The care of all the Churches is upon me:</hi> that is, he was
the Apostle of the Catholick Church of the Gentiles:
And so <hi>I teach in all the Churches of the Saints:</hi> And in
this sense it is, that I say, the Apostles have in the
Creed comprehended all the Christian world, all the
the congregations of Christ's servants, in the word
<hi>Catholick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then 2. It is to be considered that this Epithet
of the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>the pillar and ground of truth</hi> is to
be understood, to signifie in opposition to all Religions
that were not Christian. The implied Antithesis is not
of the whole to its parts, but of kind to kind; it is
not so called to distinguish it from conventions of those
who disagree in the house of God, but from those
that are out of the house; meaning that whatever
pretences of Religion the Gentile Temples, or the
Jewish Synagogues could make, truth could not be
found among them; but only in those who are assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the name of Christ, who profess his faith, and
are of the Christian Religion: for they alone can truly


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64671:50"/>
pretend to be the conservers of truth; to them only
now are committed the Oracles of God, and if these
should fail, Truth would be at a loss, and not be found
in any other Assemblies. In this sense S. <hi>Paul</hi> spake
usefully and intelligibly; for if the several conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of separated and disagreeing Christians should
call themselves, as they do and always did, the Church;
the question would be, which were the Church of God;
and by this rule you were never the nearer to know
where truh is to be found: for if you say, In the
Church of God; several pretend to it, who yet do
not teach the truth: and then you must find out
what is truth, before you find the Church. But when
the Churches of Christians are distinguish'd from the
Assemblies of Jews, and Turks, and Heathens; she is
visible and distinguishable, and notorious: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that love the truth of God, the <hi>saving truth</hi>
that <hi>makes us wise unto salvation,</hi> must become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
and in the Assemblies of Christians they must look
for it as in the proper repository, and there they shall
find it.</p>
                  <p>3. But then it is also considerable, What truth that
is, of which <hi>the Church of the living God is the pillar and
ground?</hi> It is only of the saving truths of the Gospel,
that whereby they are made members of Christ, the
house of God, the temples of the Holy Spirit. For the
Spirit of God being the Churches teacher; he will
teach us to avoid evil and to do good, to be wise and
simple, to be careful and profitable, <hi>to know God, and
whom he hath sent Jesus Christ,</hi> to increase in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and love of them, to be peaceable and charitable,
but not to entertain our selves and our <hi>weak Brethren
with doubtful disputations,</hi> but to keep close to the
foundation, and to superstruct upon that a holy life;
that is, God teaches his Church the way of salvation,
that which is necessary, and that which is useful


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64671:51"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that <hi>which will make us wise
unto salvation.</hi> But in this School we are not taught
curious questions, Unedifying notions, to unty knots
which interest and vanity, which pride and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
have introduc'd; these are taught by the Devil,
to divide the Church, and by busying them in that
which profits not, to make them neglect the wisdom
of God and the holiness of the Spirit. And we see this
truth by the experience of above 1500 years. The
Churches have troubled themselves with infinite variety
of questions, &amp; divided their precious unity, &amp; destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
charity, and instead of contending against the Devil
and all his crafty methods, they have contended against
one another, and excommunicated one another, and
anathematiz'd and damn'd one another; and no man
is the better after all, but most men are very much
the worse; and the Churches are in the world still divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
about questions that commenc'd twelve or thirteen
ages since; and they are like to be so for ever till <hi>Elias</hi>
come; which shows plainly, that God hath not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
himself in the revelations of such things; and
that he hath given us no means of ending them, but
Charity, and a return to the simple ways of Faith. And
this is yet the more considerable, because men are so far
from finding out a way to end the questions they have
made, that the very ways of ending them which they
propounded to themselves are now become the greatest
questions; and consequently themselves, and all their
other unnecessary questions, are indeterminable: their
very remedies have increased the disease. And yet
we may observe, that God's ways are not like ours,
and that his ways are the ways of truth and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting;
he hath by his wise providence preserv'd the
plain places of Scripture, and the Apostles Creed in
all Churches to be the rule and measure of that faith
by which the Churches are sav'd, and which is only


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64671:51"/>
that means of the unity of Spirit, which is the band of
peace in matters of belief. And what have the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
done since? To what necessary truths are they,
after all their clampers, advanc'd since the Apostles left
to them that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that sound <hi>form of</hi> words and
<hi>doctrine?</hi> What one <hi>great thing</hi> is there beyond this,
in which they all agree, or in which they can be
brought to agree? He that wisely observes the ways
of God, and the ways of man, will easily perceive
that God's goodness prevails over all the malice and
all the follies of mankind; and that nothing is to be
relied upon as a rule of truth, and the wayes of peace,
but what Christ hath plainly taught, and the Apostles
from him; for he alone <hi>is the Author and Finisher of
our Faith;</hi> he began it, and he perfected it: and unless
God had mightily preserved it, we had spoil'd it.</p>
                  <p>Now to bring all this home to the present Inquiry.
The event and intendment of the premisses is this.
They, who slighting the plain and perfect rule of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
rely upon the Church as an infallible guide of
faith, and judge of questions; either by <hi>the Church</hi>
mean the Congregation and Communion of Saints, or
the outward Church mingled of good and bad: and
this is intended either to mean a particular Church of
one name; or by it they understand the Catholick
Church. Now in what sense soever they depend upon
the Church for decision of questions, expecting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
determination and conduct; the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> will find she relies upon a Reed of Egypt, or at
least a staff of wooll. If by the Church they mean the
Communion of Saints only; though the persons of
men be visible, yet because their distinctive cognisance
is invisible, they can never see their guide; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can never know whether they go right or
wrong.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Eccl. milit. cap 10.</note> And the sad pressure of this argument <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
saw well enough.<note place="margin">Sect. Ad hoc, necesse est.</note> 
                     <q>It is necessary (saith he)


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64671:52"/>
it should be infallibly certain to us which Assembly
of men is the Church. For, since the Scriptures, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and plainly all Doctrines depend on the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church, unless it be most sure which is
the true Church, all things will be wholly uncertain.
But it cannot appear to us which is the true Church,
if internal faith be required of every member or
part of the Church.]</q> Now how necessary true saving
Faith, or holiness is (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls <hi>internal
faith,)</hi> I referr my self to the premisses. It is not the
Church, unless the members of the Church be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, living members; for the Church is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christ's living body. And yet if they by <hi>Church</hi>
mean any thing else, they cannot be assur'd of an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
guide; for all that are not the true servants of God
have no promise of the abode of the Spirit of truth
with them: so that the true Church cannot be a publick
Judge of questions to men, because God only knows her
numbers and her members; and the Church in the
other sense, if she be made a Judge, she is very likely
to be deceiv'd her self, and therefore cannot be relied
upon by you; for the promise of an infallible Spirit,
the Spirit of truth was never made to any but to
the Communion of Saints. 3. If by the Church you
mean any particular Church, which will you chuse;
since every such Church is esteemed fallible? But if you
mean the Catholick Church; then if you mean her an
abstracted separate Being, from all particulars, you
pursue a cloud and fall in love with an Idea, and a child
of fancy: but if by <hi>Catholick</hi> you mean all particular
Churches is the world; then though truth does infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
dwell amongst them, yet you can never go to
school to them all to learn it; in such questions which
are curious and unnecessary, and by which the salvation
of Souls is not promoted, and on which it does not rely:
not only because God never intended his Saints and


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64671:52"/>
servants should have an infallible Spirit, so to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
but also because no man can hear what all the
Christians of the world do say; no man can go to
them, nor consult with them all; nor ever come to the
knowledge of their opinions and particular sentiments.
And therefore in this inquiry to talk of the Church in
any of the present significations, is to make use of a
word that hath no meaning serving to the end of this
great Inquiry.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to provide for this necessity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
have thought of a way to find out such a Church as
may salve this <hi>Phaenomenon:</hi> and by Church they mean
the <hi>Representation of a Church;</hi> The <hi>Church represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi>
is this infallible guide; The Clergy they are
the Church; the teaching and the judging Church.
And of these we may better know what is truth in all
our Questions; for their lips are to preserve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and they are to <hi>rule and feed</hi> the rest; and <hi>the
people must require the law from them;</hi> and <hi>must follow
their faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7.</note> Indeed this was a good way once, even
in the days of the Apostles, who were faithful
stewards of the mysteries of God. And the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
men, the first Bishops who did preach the Faith, and
liv'd accordingly, these are to be <hi>remembred,</hi> that is,
their lives to be transscribed, their faith and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in faith is to be imitated: To this purpose is
that of S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to be understood. <hi>Tantae ostensiones

quam facile est ab Ecclesiâ sumere; cum Apostoli
quasi in repositorium dives plenissimè in eâ contulerint
omnia quae sint veritatis, ubi omnis quicunque velit sumat
ex eâ potum vitae. Haec est enim vitae introitus. Omnes

as long as those Bishops lived, who being their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
did evidently and notoriously teach the doctrine


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64671:53"/>
of Christ, and were of that communion; so long they,
that is, <hi>the Apostolical Churches,</hi> were a sure way to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
because it was known and confess'd, These
Clergy-guides had an infallible Unerring spirit. But as
the Church hath decayed in Discipline, and Charity
hath waxen-cold, and Faith is become interest and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
this Counsel of the Apostle, and these words
of S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> come off still the fainter. But now here
is a new question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Rulers of the
Church be <hi>the Church,</hi> that Church which is <hi>the pillar
and ground of truth;</hi> whether, when they represent
the diffusive Church, the Promises of an indeficient
faith, and the perpetual <hi>abode of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and
his <hi>leading into all truth,</hi> and <hi>teaching all things,</hi> does
in propriety belong to them? For if they do not;
then we are yet to seek for an Infallible Judge, a
Church on which our Faith may relie with certainty
and infallibility.</p>
                  <p>In answer to which I find that in Scripture the word
<hi>Ecclesia</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> is taken in contradistinction from
the Clergy; but never that it is us'd to signifie them
alone.<note place="margin">Act. 15. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Then it pleas'd the Apostles and the Elders with

Clergy in their publick capacity are not <hi>the Church,</hi> but
the <hi>Rulers of the Church; Ecclesiastici,</hi> but not <hi>Ecclesia;</hi>
they are denominatives of the Church; Bishops and
Pastors of the Church: and in their personal capacity


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64671:53"/>
are but parts and members of the Church; and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the New Testament call'd <hi>the Church</hi> indefinitely;
and this is so notorious and evident in Scripture that
it is never pretended otherwise, but in 18 of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,

this cannot be directly so, for <hi>Ecclesia</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> is, the
highest degree of the same ascent; first in private, <hi>to
one of the Church</hi> surely, for they had no society with
any else, especially in the matter of fraternal correpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
then in the company of some few <hi>[of the Church

then probable by the nature of the punishment of the
incorrigible; they become as Heathen, because they
have slighted the whole Church; and therefore are not
to be reckon'd as any part of the Church: And then last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this being an advice given to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other
Apostles; that they in this case should <hi>tell the Church;</hi>
by <hi>the Church</hi> must be meant something distinct from

immediately by Christ, intrusted to the sole conduct of

(let him answer for the expression) yet in these affairs
the people were also conducted, and so ought to be by
their Clergy-guides, who by their abilities to perswade
and govern them were the fittest for the execution of
that power. But then that which I say is this, that this
word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> signifying this Judicatory, does
not signifie the Clergy, as distinct from their flocks; and
there is not any instance in the New Testament to any
such purpose; and yet that the Clergy may also rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
but with a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> be represented by the
word <hi>Church,</hi> is very true; but this is onely by the


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64671:54"/>
change of words and their first significations. They
are the fittest to order and conduct the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
the whole Ecclesiastical Judicature. <hi>Vt omnis actus

                     <note place="margin">Epist. 27.</note> it is S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
expression; That whatever act the Church intends to
do, it should be governed by their Rulers; <hi>viz.</hi> by
consent, by preaching, by exhortation, by reason and
experience, and better knowledge of things: but the
people are to stand or fall at these Judicatories, not
because God hath given them the judgment of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit, more than to the whole Church or
Congregation; but because they are fittest to do it,
and for many other great reasons. And this appears
without contradiction true, because even the Decrees
of General Councils bind not but as they are accepted
by the several Churches in their respective Districts
and Dioceses: of which I am to give an account in the
following Periods.</p>
                  <p>But if this thing were otherwise; yet if by <hi>the

                  <p>They therefore think it necessary to do as God did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
to <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Army; they will not make use of all, but

they Reduce them to 300. The Church must

seem but a trembling foundation, and themselves are
doubtful in their confidences of it; and there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
prejudice laid against it, by the title of the
first General Council that ever was;<note place="margin">Acts 15. 4.</note> that, I mean, of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where the Apostles were presidents, and the
Presbyters were assistants, but the Church was the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Council <hi>[When they were come to Jerusalem

                     <note place="margin">23.</note> and they
did so, they sent a Decretal, with this style; <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Elders, and Brethren, send greeting to the
Brethren which are of the Gentiles.</hi> Now no man
doubts but the Spirit of Infallibility was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
and yet they had the consent of the Church in
the Decree; which Church was the company of the
converted Brethren; and by this it became a <hi>Rule:</hi>
certainly, it was <hi>the first precedent,</hi> and therefore ought
to be the measure of the rest, and this the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
from hence the succeeding Councils have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
their sacramental sanction, of <hi>Visum est Spiritui
sancto &amp; nobis:</hi> now as it was the first, so it was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
precedent in Scripture; and it was manag'd by the
Apostles, and therefore we can have no other warrant
of an Authentick Council, but this; and to think that
a few of the Rulers of Churches should be a just repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of the Church, for infallible determination
of all questions of Faith is no way warranted in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64671:55"/>
and there is neither here, nor any where else, any
word or commission that the Church ever did or could
delegate the Spirit to any representatives, or pass In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
by a Commission or Letter of Attorney: and
therefore to call a General Council <hi>the Church,</hi> or to
think that all the priviledges and graces given by Christ
to his Church is there in a part of the Church, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without warrant or authority.</p>
                  <p>But this is made manifest by matter of fact; and the
Church never did intend to delegate any such power,
but always kept it in her own hand; I mean the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judicature, both in faith and discipline. I shall
not go far for instances, but observe some in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church it self, which are therefore the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
because in the time of her Reign, General
Councils were arrived to great heights, and the highest

But there are many more things to be considered.

National, Diocesan; the first inquiry will be
which of all these, or whether all of these, will be an
infallible guide, and of necessity to be obeyed. I doubt
not, but it will be roundly answered; that only the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils are the last and supreme Judicatory, and
that alone which is infallible. But yet how Uncertain
this Rule will be,<note place="margin">Vbi supra. act. 3.</note> appears in this, that the gloss of the
Canon Law * says, <hi>Non videtur, Metropolitanos posse
condere Canones in suis Conciliis;</hi> at least not in great
matters, <hi>imò non licet:</hi> yet the VII<hi>th.</hi> Synod allows
the Decrees, <hi>Decistones localium Conciliorum,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
of local Councils. But I suppose it is in these
as it is in the General: they that will accept them, may;
and if they will approve the Decrees of Provincial
Councils, they become a Law unto themselves; and
without this acceptation, General Councils cannot
give Laws to others.</p>
                  <p>2. It will be hard to tell, which are General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 4. de Concil. &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. <hi>Sect.</hi> Vocuntur enim.</note>
and which are not; for, the <hi>Roman</hi> Councils un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Symmachus,</hi> all the world knows can but pretend
to be local or provincial, consisting only of <hi>Italians,</hi>
and yet they bear <hi>Vniversal</hi> in their Style; and it is
always said (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> * confesses) <hi>Symmachus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio
Generali praesidens,</hi> and the <hi>3d.</hi> Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
in the <hi>18th</hi> Chapter, uses this mandatory form, <hi>Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
haec sancta &amp; Vniversalis Synodus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3, But if we will suppose a <hi>Catachrêsis</hi> in this style;
and that this title of <hi>Vniversal,</hi> means but a <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
that is, an Universal of that place; though this be
a hard expression; because the most particular or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Councils are or may be universal to that place; yet
this may be pardon'd; since it is like the Catholick <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
style, that is, the manner of speaking in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
particular Church; but after all this, it will be


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64671:57"/>
very hard in good Earnest to tell which Councils are
indeed Universal, or General Councils. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
reckons eighteen from <hi>Nicene</hi> to <hi>Trent</hi> inclusively; so
that the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> is the sixteenth; and yet
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh calls it the eighth General;
and is reproved for it by <hi>Surius,</hi> who, for all the Pope's
infallibility, pretended to know more than the Pope
would allow. The last <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, <hi>viz.</hi> the fifth,
is at <hi>Rome</hi> esteem'd a General Council; In <hi>Germany</hi>
and <hi>France</hi> it passes for none at all, but a faction and
pack of Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>4. There are divers General Councils, that, though
they were such, yet they are rejected by almost all the
christian world. It ought not to be said, that these are
not General Councils, because they were conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of heretical persons; for if a Council can consist
of heretical persons (as by this instance it appears it
may) then a General Council is no sure rule or ground
of faith. And all those Councils which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> calls
<hi>reprobate</hi> are as so many proofs of this. For what ever
can be said against the Council of <hi>Ariminum;</hi> yet
they cannot say but it consisted of DC<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bishops: and
therefore it was as general as any ever was before it,
but the faults that are found with it, prove indeed
that it is not to be accepted; but then they prove two
things more, First, That a General Council binds not
till it be accepted by the Churches; and therefore that
all its authority depends on them; and they do not
depend upon it. And secondly, that there are some
General Councils which are so far from being infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
that they are directly false, schismatical, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical.
And if when the Churches are divided in a
question, and the communion, like the Question, is in
flux and reflux; when one side prevails greatly they
get a General Council on their side, and prevail by it;
but lose as much, when the other side play the same


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64671:57"/>
game in the day of their advantages. And it will be
to no purpose to tell me of any Collateral advantages
that this Council hath more than another Council; for
though I believe so, yet others do not; and their
Council is as much a General Council to them as our
Council is to us. And therefore if General Councils
are the rule and law of faith in those things they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
then all that is to be considered in this affair,
is, Whether they be General Councils. Whether they
say true or no, is not now the question, but is to be
determin'd by this, <hi>viz.</hi> whether are they General
Councils or no; for relying upon their authority for
the truth, if they be satisfied that they are General
Councils; that they speak and determine truth will be
consequent and allowed. Now then if this be the
question, then since divers General Councils are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
the consequent is, that although they be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, yet they may be reprov'd. And if a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
producing the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council be r'encontred
by an Arian producing the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> which
was farre more numerous; here are <hi>aquilis aquilae
&amp; pila minantia pilis;</hi> but who shall prevail? If a
General Council be the rule and guide they will both
prevail; that is, neither. And it ought not to be said
by the Catholick; Yea, but our Council determin'd
for the truth, but yours for errour; for the Arian will
say so too. But whether they do or no; yet it is plain,
that they may both say so: and if they do, then we do
not find the truth out by the conduct and decision of
a General Council; but we approve this General, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
upon other accounts we believe that what is
there defin'd is true. And therefore S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s way here
is best; <hi>Neque ego Nicenum Concilium, neque tu Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minense,</hi>
&amp;c. both sides pretend to General Councils:
that which both equally pretend to, will help neither;
therefore let us go to Scripture. But there are amongst


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64671:58"/>
many others two very considerable instances, by which
we may see plainly at what rate Councils are declar'd
<hi>General.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A. D. 755.</note> There was a Council held at <hi>C. P.</hi> under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinus
Copronymus</hi> of 338 Bishops. It was in that
unhappy time when the question of worshipping or
breaking images was disputed.<note place="margin">A D. 786. aut 789.</note> This Council com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
images to be destroyed out of Churches; and
this was a General Council: and yet 26, or, as some say,
31 years after, this was condemned by another General
Council, <hi>viz.</hi> the second at <hi>Nice</hi> which decreed images
to be worshipped; not long after, about five years, this
General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> for that very reason was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by a General Council of <hi>Francford,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by the Western Churches. Now of what value
is a General Council to the determination of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of faith, when one General Council condemns an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
General Council with great liberty, and without
scruple. And it is to no purpose to allege reasons or
excuses why this or that Council is condemn'd; for if
they be General, and yet may without reason be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
then they have no authority; but if they be
condemned with reason, then they are not infallible.
The other instance is in those Councils which were
held when the dispute began between the Council and
the Pope. The Council of <hi>Constance</hi> consisting of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a thousand Fathers first and last, defin'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to be above the Pope; the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and
the fift Council in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> have condemn'd this
Council so far, as to that article. The Council of <hi>Basil,</hi>
all the world knows how greatly they asserted their
own Authority over the Pope; but therefore though
in <hi>France</hi> it is accepted, yet in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> it is not.</p>
                  <p>But what is the meaning, that some Councils are
partly approv'd and partly condemned, the Council
of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that in <hi>Trullo,</hi> those of <hi>Francfort, Constance,</hi>
and <hi>Basil?</hi> but that every man, and every Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64671:58"/>
the General Councils, as far as they please, and
no further? The <hi>Greeks</hi> receive but seven General
Councils, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> receive six, the <hi>Eutychians</hi>
in <hi>Asia</hi> receive but the first three, the <hi>Nestorians</hi> in the
East receive but the first two, the <hi>Anti-trinitarians</hi> in
<hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> receive none. The Church of
<hi>England</hi> receives the four first Generals as of highest
regard, not that they are infallible; but that they
have determin'd wisely and holily. <hi>Pro captu lectoris
habent sua fata</hi>—It is as every one likes: for the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that receives sixteen, are divided;
and some take-in others, and reject some of these, as
I have shown.</p>
                  <p>5. How can it be known which is a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and how many conditions are requir'd for the
building such a great House? The question is worth
the asking, not only because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
teaches us to rely upon a General Council as the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judge and final determiner of questions; but
because I perceive that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is at a loss
concerning General Councils.<note place="margin">A. D. 1409. de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But it is fit that it be inquir'd, How we shall know
which, or what, is a General Council; and which is not.
1. If we inquire into the number of the Bishops there
present, we cannot find any certain Rule for that:
but be they many or few, the parties interested will,


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64671:59"/>
if they please, call it a General Council. And they
will not, dare not, I suppose at <hi>Rome,</hi> make a quarrel
upon that point; when in the sixth Session of <hi>Trent,</hi> as
some printed Catalogues<note n="*" place="margin">1546.</note> inform us, they may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
there were but 38 persons in all, at their first sitting
down, of which number some were not Bishops: and at
last, there were but 57 Archbishops and Bishops in all.
In the first Session were but three Archbishops, and
twenty three Bishops; and in all the rest about sixty
Archbishops and Bishops was the usual number till the
last; and yet there are some Councils of far greater
antiquity who are rejected, although their number of
Bishops very far surpass the numbers of <hi>Trent:</hi> In <hi>Nice,</hi>
were 318 Bishops; in that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> were 600; and in
that of <hi>Basil</hi> were above 400 Bishops, and in that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
were 300, besides the other Fathers (as they call
them.) But this is but one thing of many; though it
will be very hard to think that all the power and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
the virtual faith, and potential infallibility of the
whole Christian Church should be in 80 or 90 Bishops
taken out of the neighbour-Countreys.</p>
                  <p>6. But then if we consider upon what pitiful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors do evacuate the Authority
of Councils; we shall find them to be such, that by the
like, which can never be wanting to a witty person,
the authority of every one of them may be vilified, and
consequently, they can be infallible security to no
man's faith. <hi>Charles</hi> the 7th of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
Church assembled at <hi>Bruges,</hi> rejected the latter Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Council of <hi>Basil;</hi> because they depriv'd
<hi>P. Eugenius,</hi> and created <hi>Felix</hi> the 5th; and because it
was doubtful whether that Assembly did sufficiently
represent the Catholick Church. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> says,
that the <hi>former Sessions</hi> of the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid
and null; because certain Bishops fell off there,
and were faulty. Now if this be a sufficient cause of


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64671:59"/>
nullity; then if ever there be a schism, or but a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of opinions, the other party may deny the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Council; and especially, if any of them
change their opinion, and go to the prevailing side;
the other hath the same cause of complaint: but this
ought not at all to prevail, till it be agreed how many
Bishops must be present; for if some fail, if enough
remain there is no harm done to the Authority. But
because any thing is made use of for an excuse; it is
a sure sign they are but pretended more than regarded,
but just when they serve mens turns. The Council
of <hi>C. P.</hi> under <hi>Leo Isaurus</hi> is rejected by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists;</hi>
because there was no Patriarch present but
S. <hi>German;</hi> though all the world knows, the reason is
because they decreed against images. But if the other
were a good Reason; then it is necessary that all the
old Patriarchs should be present; and if this be true, then
the General Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is null; because all the
Patriarchs were not present at it; and particularly the
Patriarch of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and in that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> there
wanted the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And the first of
<hi>C. P.</hi> could not have all the Patriarchs, nether could it
be Representative of the whole Church; because at
the same time there was another Council at <hi>Rome:</hi>
and, which is worse to the <hi>Romanists</hi> than all that, the
Council of Trent upon this, and a 1000 more is invalid;
because themselves reckon but three Patriarchs there
present; one was of <hi>Venice,</hi> another of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and the
third was only a titular of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> none of which
were really any of the old Patriarchs, whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was so great in the Ancient Councils.</p>
                  <p>7. It is impossible as things are now that a General
Council should be a sure Rule or Judge of Faith,<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 1. de Concil. &amp; Eccles. cap. 15.</note> since
it can never be agreed who of necessity are to be called,

they determin'd what was the proper consequent of
such Principles; which the Christians consented in:
and he says,<note place="margin">Socrat. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>8. But how if the Church be divided in a Question
which hath caused so great disturbances that it is
thought fit to call a Council: here will be an Eternal
Uncertainty. If they call both sides, they will never
agree. If they call but one, then they are Parties and
Judges too.<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 2. cap. 16.</note> In the General Council of <hi>Sardis,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

all Bishops, Catholick and Arians, were equally admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
so it was also both at <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia;</hi>
and so it was at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi>
sate together. But if one side onely, exclude all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
and declare them criminals before hand, as it
happened at <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> how is that one party a
representative of the Church; when so great a part of
Christendom is not consulted, not heard, not suffer'd?</p>
                  <p>9. Suppose, a Council being called, the Bishops be
divided in their opinion, how shall the decision be?
By the major number of voices, surely. But how much
the major? shall one alone above the equal number
carry it? That were strange that one man should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the faith of Christendom? Must there be two
thirds, as it was propounded in <hi>Trent,</hi> in some cases;
but if this be, who shall make any man sure that the
Holy Spirit of God shall go over to those two thirds,
and leave the remaining party to themselves? And
who can ascertain us that the major part is the more
wise and more holy; or, if they be not, yet that they
shall speak more truth? But in this also, the Doctors
are uncertain and divided; and how little truth is to
be given to the major part in causes of faith, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Doctors may learn from their own Abbot of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Panorm. in corp. s ignificasti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>de Elect.</note>
and the Chancellour of <hi>Paris.</hi> The first saying,
<hi>The opinion of one Godly man ought to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64671:61"/>
of the Old and New Testament:</hi> and the latter saying,
<hi>Every learned man may and ought to withstand a whole
Council, if he perceive it erres of malice or ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. The world is not yet agreed, in whose power
it is to call the Councils; and if it be done by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
authority, the whole convention is schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical;
and therefore not to be trusted as a Judge of
Consciences and questions of faith. The Emperors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
did it of old; and the Popes of late: but let
this be agreed first, and then let the other questions
come before them; till then, we cannot be sure.</p>
                  <p>11. Lastly, if General Councils be suppos'd to be the
rule and measure of Faith; Christendom must needs
be in a sad condition and state of doubt for ever: not
onely because a Council is not called, it may be, in
two or three Ages; but because no man can be sure
that all things are observed which men say are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
neither did the several Churches ever agree what
was necessary, nor did they ever agree to set down the
laws and conditions requisite to their being such: and
therefore they have well and wisely comported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this; that never any General Council did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that a General Council is infallible. Indeed <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
labours greatly to prove it out of Scripture:
his best argument is the promise that Christ made, that
<hi>when two or three are gathered in my name, I will be in
the midst of them;</hi> and, <hi>I will be with you to the end of
the world.</hi> Now to these authorities I am now no
other way to answer but by observing that these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
do as much prove every Christian-meeting of
any sort of good Christians to be as infallible as a
Council, and that a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Council is as sure a guide
as a <hi>General:</hi> and it is impossible, from those, or any
other like words of Christ, to prove the contrary; and
therefore gives us no certainty here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> But if General Councils in themselves be so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64671:61"/>
yet the Roman Doctors now at last are come to
some certainty; for if the Pope confirm a Council,
then it is right and true, and the Church is a rule which
can never fail, and never can deceive, or leave men in
uncertainty; for a spirit of infallibility is then in the
Churches representative, when head and members are
joyn'd together. This is their last stress, and if this cord
break they have nothing to hold them.</p>
                  <p>Now for this, there are divers great Considerations
which will soon put this matter to issue. For although
this be the new device of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Pope's flatterers, especially the Jesuites, and that this
never was so much as probably prov'd; but boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
and weakly grounded: yet this is not defin'd as
a doctrine of the Roman Church.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 9 de Concil. &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia.</note> For 1. we find
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckoning six cases of necessity or utility of
calling General Councils; and four of them are of that
nature, that the Pope is either not in being, or else is a
party, the person to be judg'd: As, 1. if there be a
schism amongst the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> as when there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be two or three Popes together; which hapned
in the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi> Or 2. if the
Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> be suspected of heresie. Or 3. when there
is great necessity of reformation of manner in head and
members; which hath been so notoriously called for
above 400 years. Or 4. if the election of the Pope be
question'd. Now in these cases it is impossible that the
consent of the Pope should be necessary to make up
the Authority of the Council, since the Pope is the
<hi>pars rea,</hi> and the Council is the onely Judge. And
of this there can be no question: And therefore the
Popes authority is not necessary, nor of avail to make
the Council valid.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Popes approbation of the Council make it
to be an infallible guide, then since without it, it is
not Infallible, not yet the supreme Judicatory, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64671:62"/>
that the Pope is above the Council: which is a
thing very uncertain in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but it
hath been denied in divers General Councils, as by
the first <hi>Pisan;</hi> by the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> the fourth
and fifth Sessions; by the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the sixteenth and eighteenth and 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Sessions;
by the Council of <hi>Bruges</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and
by the pragmatick Sanction: all which have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
that <q>[A General Council hath its authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from Christ (and consequently not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the Pope) and that it is necessary that
every person in what dignity soever, though Papal,
should be obedient to it, in things that concern faith,
the extirpation of schism, and the reformation of the
Church of God both in head and members]</q> This is
the decree of the Council of <hi>Constance;</hi> which also
addes further <q>[That whosoever shall neglect to
obey the commands, statutes, ordinances and decrees
of this or any other General Council lawfully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
in the things aforesaid, or thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<hi>[viz.</hi> in matters of faith, or manners] made
or to be made, if he do not repent of it, he shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
a condign penance; yea, and with recourse to
other remedies of law against him, of what condition,
estate or dignity soever he be, though he be the Pope.]</q>
The same was confirm'd in the Council of <hi>Lausanna,</hi>
and the second <hi>Pisan</hi> in the third Session: so that here
are six General Councils all declaring the Pope to be
inferior and submitted to a Council; They created
Popes in some of them; they decreed when Councils
should be called, they Judged Popes, they deposed
them, they commanded their obedience, they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to impose penances if they obeyed not, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to further remedies in law; and the second <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,</hi>
beside the former particulars, declared that the
Synod neither could nor should be dissolved without


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64671:62"/>
their universal consent; nevertheless, by the common
consent it might be removed to a place of safety, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with the Pope, if he could be got to consent
thereunto; always provided it be not at <hi>Rome.</hi> And
yet this very Council was approv'd and commended
by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Platina in Alex. Quinto. Naucl. tom. 2. gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. 47.</note> as both <hi>Platina,</hi> and <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerus</hi>
witness: and the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> was called
by Pope <hi>John</hi> the 23. He presided in it, and was for his
wicked life deposed by it; and yet <hi>Platina</hi> in his life,
says, he approv'd it; and after him so did Pope <hi>Martin</hi>
the <hi>5th</hi> (as is to be seen in the last Session of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,)
and <hi>Eugenius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vide 16. c. 18. Session.</note> and the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi>
and <hi>Lausanna</hi> was confirm'd by Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi>
as is to be seen in his Bull; and not only Pope <hi>Martin</hi>
the <hi>5th,</hi> but Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> approv'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Basil.</hi> It were a needless trouble to reckon the
consenting testimonies of many learned Divines and
Lawyers, bearing witness to the Council's superiority
over Popes. More material it is that many famous
Universities, particularly that of <hi>Paris, Erford, Colein,
Vienna, Cracovia;</hi> all unanimously did affirm the power
of General Councils over Popes, and principally for
this thing relied upon the Authority of the General
Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if a General Council, confirmed by a Pope, be
a Rule or Judge of Faith and Manners; then this is
an Article of Faith, that the Authority of a General
Council does not depend upon the Pope, but on Christ
immediately; and then the Pope's confirmation does
not make it valid, any more than the confirmation or
consent of the other Patriarchs for their respective
Provinces. For here are many Councils, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by divers Popes.</p>
                  <p>But that it may appear how Uncertain all,<note place="margin">De comparatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne authoritatis Papae &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci. ii.</note> even the
Greatest things are at <hi>Rome,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> wrote
a Book against this doctrine, and against the Councils


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64671:63"/>
of <hi>Constance, Basil,</hi> and <hi>Pisa,</hi> and <hi>Gerson</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of <hi>Paris:</hi> which book King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII<hi>th</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> required the University of <hi>Paris</hi> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
which they did to very good purpose. And
the latter Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have us'd their utmost dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to disgrace and nullifie all these Councils, and
to stifle the voice and consciences of all men, and to
trample General Councils under their feet. Now how
can the Souls of Christian people put their questions
and differences to their determination, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are biting and scratching one another? He was
likely to prove but an ill Physician, who gave advices
to a woman that had gotten a cold, when himself
could scarce speak for coughing. I am not concern'd
here to say what I think of the question, or whether
the Council or the Pope be in the right; for I think, as
to the power of determining matters of Faith infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
they are both in the wrong. But that which I
observe, is, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is greatly divided
about their Judge of Controversies, and are never
like to make an end of it, unless one Party be beaten
into a good compliant belief with the other. I shall
only add a conclusion to these premisses in the words
of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Concil cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. l. 2. c. 24. Sect. Accedit.</note> 
                     <hi>Si Concilia Generalia possent errare,
nullum esset in Ecclesia firmum judicium, quo Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versiae
componi, &amp; Vnitas in Ecclesiâ servari possit,</hi>
If a General Council can erre, there is no sure judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Church for the composing Controversies, and
preserving Unity. I shall not need to take advantage of
these words, by observing that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath by
them evacuated all the Authority of the Pope's defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
questions <hi>in Cathedrâ</hi> for if a General Council
can fail, nothing amongst them can be certain. This
is that which I observe; that since this thing is rendred
so Uncertain upon the stock of their own wranglings,
and not agreeing upon which are General Councils; one


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64671:63"/>
part condemning some, which very many others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them acknowledge for such: it is impossible, by
their own Doctrine, that they can have any place where
to set their foot, and say, Here I fix upon a Rock, and
cannot be moved. And there being so many condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
requir'd, and so many ways of failing laid to
their charge, and many more that may be found out;
and it being impossible that we can be infallibly assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that none of them hath hapned in any General
Council that comes to be question'd: How can any man
rely upon the decision of a Council as infallible, of
which he cannot ever be infallibly assured that it hath
proceeded <hi>Concilialiter</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s new word is,)
or that it hath in it nothing that does evacuate or lessen
its authority. And after all this, suppose we are all agreed
about any Convention, and allow it to be a General
Council; yet they do not always end the questions
when they have defin'd them; and the Decrees them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
make a new harvest of Uncertainties: Of this we
have too many witnesses, even all the Questions which
in the world are made concerning the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Decrees and Canons in the respective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.
And when <hi>Andreas Vega,</hi> and <hi>Dominicus à Soto,</hi>
and <hi>Soto,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A. D. 1546.</note> and <hi>Catarinus</hi> (who were all present at the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and understood the meaning of the
Council as well as any, except the Legats and their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Juncto) wrote books against one another, and both
sides brought the words of the Council for themselves,
and yet neither prevailed; <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> the Legat, who
well enough understood that the Council intended not
to determine the truth, yet, to silence their wranglings
in the Council, let them dispute abroad; but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
would not end it, by clearing the ambiguity. And
since this became the mode of Christendom to do so
upon design; it can be no wonder that things are left
Uncertain for all the Decrees of Councils.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64671:64"/>
It is well therefore that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires
Faith to her Conclusions, greater than her Premisses
can perswade. It is the only way of escaping that is left
them, as being conscious that none of their Arguments
can enforce what they would have believ'd. And to
the same purpose it is, that they teach the Conclusions
and definitions of Councils to be infallible, though
their Arguments and Proceedings be fallible, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and false. If they can perswade the world to
this, they have got the Goal; only it ought to be
confess'd by them that do submit to the definition, that
they do so, mov'd to it by none of their Reasons, but
they know not why.</p>
                  <p>I do not here enter into the particular examination
of the matters determined by many Councils; by
which it might largely and plainly appear how greatly
General Councils have been mistaken. This hath been
observed already by many very learned men: And the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is the greatest instance of it in the
world, as will be made to appear in the procedure of
this Book. But the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves by rejecting
divers General Councils have (as I have above ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd)
given proof enough of this. That all things
are here Uncertain I have prov'd; and that if there be
error here, there can be no certainty any where else,
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesses: So that I have thus far discharg'd
what I undertook.</p>
                  <p>But beyond this, there are some other particulars fit to
be consider'd, by which it will yet further appear that in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unless they will rely upon the
plain Scriptures, they have no sure foundation: instance
in those several Articles, which some of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Doctors say are <hi>de fide;</hi> and others of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when they are press'd with them, say they are not
<hi>de fide,</hi> but the opinions of private Doctors; That, if
a Prince turn Heretick, that is, be not of the <hi>Roman</hi>


                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64671:64"/>
party, he presently loses all right to his temporal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions;
That the Pope can change Kingdoms, taking
from one, and giving to another, this is esteemed by
the Jesuits a matter of Faith. It is <hi>certa, indubitata,
definita virorum clarissimorum sententia;</hi> said <hi>Creswel</hi>
the Jesuit in his <hi>Philopater. F. Garnet</hi> said more, it is,
<hi>Totius Ecclesiae &amp; quidem ab antiquissimis temporibus
consensione recepta doctrina.</hi> It is receiv'd, saith <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
by the whole School of Divines and Canon-Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers;
nay it is <hi>Certum &amp; de fide,</hi> It is matter of Faith.
I know that the <hi>English</hi> Priests will think themselves
injur'd if you impute this Doctrine to them, or say, It
is the Catholick Doctrine: and yet, that this power in
Temporals that he can depose Kings sometimes, is in
the Pope,<note place="margin">Contr. Barclai. cap. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Non opinio, sed certitudo apud Catholicos est,</hi>

amongst the Catholicks. Now since this is not believ'd
by all that call themselves Catholicks, and yet by
others of greatest note it is said to be the Catholick
Doctrine, to be certain, to be a point of Faith; I desire
to know, Where this Faith is founded, which is the
house of Faith, where is their warrant, their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and foundation of their Article. For if an <hi>English</hi>
Scholar in the Colledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> had, in confession to
<hi>F. Parsons, Creswel, Garnet, Bellarmine,</hi> or any of their
parties, confessed that he had spoken against the Pope's
power of deposing Kings in any case, or of any pretence
of killing Kings: it is certain they could not have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
him, till he had renounc'd his Heresy; and they
must have declar'd that if he had died in that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he must have been damned; what rest shall this
poor man have, or hope for? He pretends that the
Council of <hi>Constance</hi> had declar'd for his opinion; and
therefore that his and not theirs, is certain and matter of
Faith: They, tell him no; and yet for their Article of
Faith, have neither Father nor Council, Scripture nor


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64671:65"/>
Reason, Tradition, nor Ancient Precedent; where then
is this foundation upon which the article is built? It
lies low, as low as Hell, but can never be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
and yet amongst them, Articles of faith grow up
without root and without foundation; but a man may
be threatned with damnation amongst them for any
trifle, and affrighted with clappers and men of clouts.
If they have a clear and certain rule, why do their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
differ about the points of faith? They say some
things are articles of faith, and yet do not think fit to
give a reason of their faith; for indeed they cannot.
But if this be the way of it amongst Roman Doctors,
they may have many faiths, as they have <hi>Breviaries</hi>
in several Churches; <hi>secundum usum Sarum, secundum
usum Scholae Romanae;</hi> and so, without ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
even the Catholicks become hereticks one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
it is by chance if it happen to be otherwise.</p>
                  <p>2. What makes a point to be <hi>de fide?</hi> If it be said,
The decision of a General Council; Then since no
General Council hath said so; then this proposition is
not <hi>de fide?</hi> that <hi>what a General Council says is true, is
to be believed as matter of faith;</hi> for if the authority
be not <hi>de fide,</hi> then how can the particulars of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
be <hi>de fide?</hi> for the conclusion must follow
the weaker part; and if the Authority it self be left
in uncertainty, the Decrees cannot be infallible.</p>
                  <p>3. As no man living can tell, that a Council hath
proceeded rightly; so no man can tell when an Article
of faith is firmly decreed, or when a matter is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
propounded, or when the Pope hath perfectly
defin'd an article: of all this the Canon law is the
Greatest testimony in the world, where there is Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
against Council, Pope against Pope; and among so
many decrees of faith and manners it cannot be told
what is, and what is not certain. For when the Popes
have sent their rescripts to a Bishop, or any other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64671:65"/>
to order an affair of life or doctrine; either he
wrote that with an intent to oblige all Christendom,
or did not. If not, why is it put into the body of the
laws; for what is a greater signature, or can pass a
greater obligation then the Authentick Code of laws?
But if these were written with an intent to oblige all
Christendom; how come they to be prejudic'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded,
abrogated, by contrary laws; and desuetude,
by change of times and changes of opinion? And in all
that great body of laws registred in the <hi>decretum,</hi> and
the <hi>Decretals, Clementins,</hi> and <hi>Extravagants,</hi> there
is no signe or distinctive cognisance of one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and yet some of them are regarded, and very
many are not. When Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> decreed that those
who were converted from heresie should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiz'd;<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 7. hist. 4. c. 3 &amp; 4. lib. de unico baptis. c. 14.</note>
and to that purpose wrote against S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
in the Question, and declar'd it to be unlawful, and
threatned excommunication to them that did it (as
S. <hi>Austin</hi> tells); S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> regarded it not, but he and
a Council of fourscore Bishops decreed it ought to be
done, and did so to their dying day. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
all this to be true; but says, that Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> did
not declare this <hi>tanquam de fide;</hi> but that after this
definition it was free to every one to think as they list;
nay,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4. de Pont. Rom. c. 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> Et per hoc.</note> that though it was plain that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> refus'd to
obey the Pope's sentence, yet <hi>non est omninò certum,</hi> that
he did sin mortally. By all this he hath made it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that it cannot easily be known when a Pope does
define a thing to be <hi>de fide,</hi> or when it is a sin to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
him, or when it is necessary he should be obeyed.
Now then since in the Canon law there are so very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
decrees, and yet no mark of difference, of right or
wrong, necessary or not necessary; how shall we be
able to know certainly in what state or condition the
soul of every of the Pope's subjects is? especially since
without any cognisance or certain mark all the world


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64671:66"/>
are commanded under pain of damnation to obey the
Pope. In the <hi>Extravagant de Majoritate &amp; Obedientiâ</hi>
are these words, <hi>Dicimus, definimus, pronunciamus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutè
necessarium ad salutem omni humanae creaturae,
subesse Romano Pontifici.</hi> Now when can it be thought
that a Pope defines any article <hi>in Cathedra,</hi> if these
words, <hi>Dicimus, definimus, pronunciamus, &amp; necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
ad salutem,</hi> be not sufficient to declare his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Now if this be true that the Pope said this; he
said true or false. If false, how sad is the condition of
the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who are affrighted with the terrible
threatnings of damnation for nothing? And if it be
true, what became of the souls of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the
<hi>African Bishops,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epist. S. Cyprian. ad Pompeium.</note> who did not submit to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> but call'd him <hi>proud, ignorant, and of a dark and
wicked mind? Seriò praecepit,</hi> said <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
commanded it, but did not determine it as
necessary: and how in a Question of faith, and so great
Concern this distinction can be of any avail, can never
be known, and can never be prov'd; since they declare
the Pope sufficiently to be of that faith against S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
and the Africans, and that in pursuance of this
his faith he proceeded so far, and so violently. But
now the matter is grown infinitely worse. For 1. the
Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have made innumerable decrees in the
<hi>Decretum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In l. Benè à Zeno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Decretals, Bulls, Taxes, Constitutions, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentines,</hi>
and <hi>Extravagants.</hi> 2. They, as <hi>Albericus de
Rosate,</hi> a Great Canonist, affirms, sometimes exalt their
constitutions, and sometimes abase them, according to
the times. And yet 3. All of them are verified and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
under the same Sanction by the Council of
<hi>Trent;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sess. 25. c. 20.</note> all, I say, which were ever made in favour of
Ecclesiastical Persons, and the Liberties of the Church;
which are indeed the greater part of all after <hi>Gratians</hi>
decree: witness the Decretals of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
<hi>Boniface</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, the <hi>Collectio diversarum Constitutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64671:66"/>
&amp; literarum Romanorum Pontificum,</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal
Epistles</hi> of the Roman Bishops in three Volumes,
besides the <hi>Ecloga Bullarum &amp; motuum propriorum.</hi>
All this is not onely an intolerable burden to the
Christian Churches, but a snare to consciences, and no
man can tell by all this that is before him, whether he
deserve love or hatred, whether he be in the state of
mortal sin, of damnation, or salvation. But this is no
new thing: More than this was decreed in the Ancient
Canon law it self.<note place="margin">Decret. dist. 19. c. Sic omnes, C. Eni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And again, <hi>Ab omnibus quicquid statuit, quicquid
ordinat, perpetuò quidem &amp; infragibiliter observandum

all things whatsoever are decreed or ordain'd by
the Roman Church. Nay, <hi>licèt vix ferendum,</hi> although
what that holy See imposes, be as yet scarce tolerable,
yet let us bear it, and with holy devotion suffer it,
says the Canon,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>In memoriam.</hi> And that all this might
indeed be an intolerable yoke, the Canon, <hi>Nulli fas est,</hi>
addes the Pope's curse and final threatnings. <hi>Sit ergo
ruinae suae dolore prostratus, quisquis Apostolicis voluerit
contraire decretis;</hi> and every one that obeys not the
Apostolical decrees is <hi>majoris excommunicationis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectione
abjiciendus.</hi> The Canon is directed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
against the Clergy. And the gloss upon this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
affirms, that he who denies the Pope's power of
making Canons, <hi>(viz.</hi> to oblige the Church) is a here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
Now considering that the decree of <hi>Gratian</hi> is
<hi>Concordantia discordantiarum,</hi> a heap or bundle of
Contrary opinions, doctrines and rules; and they agree
no otherwise then a <hi>Hyaena</hi> and a <hi>Dog</hi> catch'd in the
same snare, or put into a bag; and that the Decretals
and Extravagants are in very great parts of them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but boxes of tyranny and errour, usurpation and
superstition; onely that upon those boxes they write


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64671:67"/>
                     <hi>Ecclesia Catholica,</hi> and that all these are commanded to
be believ'd and observ'd respectively; and all gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers
to be cursed and excommunicated; and that the
twentieth part of them is not known to the Christian
world, and some are rejected, and some never accepted,
and some slighted into desuetude, and some thrown off
as being a load too heavie, and yet that there is no rule
to discern these things: it must follow that matters of
faith determin'd and recorded in the Canon law, and
the laws of manners there established, and the matter
of salvation and damnation consequent to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
or not observation of them, must needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
uncertain, and no man can from their grounds
know, what shall become of him.</p>
                  <p>There are so very many points of faith in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so many Decrees of Councils, which, when
they please, make an Article of faith, and so many are
presumptuously by private Doctors affirm'd to be <hi>de
fide</hi> which are not; that, considering that the common
people are not taught to rely upon the plain words of
Scripture, and the Apostles Creed, for a sufficient rule
of their faith, but are threatned with damnation, if
they do not believe whatever their Church hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd;
and yet they neither do, nor can know it but
by the word of their Parish Priest, or Confessor; it lies
in the hand of every Parish Priest to make the People
believe any thing, and be of any religion, and trust to
any Article, as they shall choose and find to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> requires Traditions to
be added and received equal with Scriptures; <hi>they
both,</hi> not singly but <hi>in conjunction</hi> making up the full
object of faith; and so the most learned, and indeed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
their whole Church understands one to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete
without the other: and yet Master <hi>White,</hi>
who I suppose tells the same thing to his Neighbours,
affirms that it is not the Catholick position, That all


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64671:67"/>
its doctrines are not contain'd in Scripture: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
being tied with the decree of the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> gives a very good account of it, and makes it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
sense. Thus, <hi>Traditions must be receiv'd with
equal authority to the Scripture,</hi> (saith the Council)
and wonder not; for (saith Master <hi>White) all the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Church are in Scripture.</hi> You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
so, if you please; for <hi>the contrary is not a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
doctrine.</hi> But if these two things do not agree bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
then it will be hard to tell what regard will be
had to what the Council says: the People know not
that, but as their Priest teaches them. And though
they are bound under greatest pains to believe the
whole Catholick Religion: yet that the Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do not know it, or wilfully mis-report it; and
therefore that the people cannot tell it; it is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in this instance, and in the multitude of disputes
which are amongst themselves, about many conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Articles in their Catholick religion.<note place="margin">Vide Wadding of Immac. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. p. 282. &amp; p. 334. &amp; alibi.</note> 
                     <hi>Pius Quintus</hi>
speaking of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> calls his doctrine the most
certain rule of Christian religion. And divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the religion of the <hi>Romanists</hi> are prov'd out of
the revelations of S. <hi>Briget,</hi> which are contradicted by
those of S. <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Siena.</hi> Now they not relying
on the way of God, fall into the hands of men, who
teach them according to the interest of their order, or
private fancy, and expound their rules by measures of
their own, but yet such which they make to be the
measures of salvation and damnation. They are taught
to rely for their faith upon the Church, and this when
it comes to practise is nothing but their private Priest;
and he does not always tell them the sense of their
Church, and is not infallible in declaring the sense of
it, and is not always (as appears in the instance now set
down) faithful in relating of it, but first consens himself
by his subtilty, and then others by his confidence;


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64671:68"/>
and therefore in is impossible there can be any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to them that proceed this way, when God hath so
plainly given them a better, and requires of them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to live a holy life, as a superstructure of
Christian Faith describ'd by the Apostles in plain places
of Scripture, and in the Apostolical Creed; in which
they can suffer no illusion, and where there is no Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
in the matters to be believ'd.</p>
                  <p>IV. The next thing I observe, is, that they all talking of
the Church, as of a charm and sacred Amulet, yet they
cannot by all their arts make us certain where, or how,
infallibly to find this Church. I have already in this
Section prov'd this in the main Inquiry; by shewing
that the Church is that body, which they do not rely
upon: but now I shall shew that the Church which they
would point out, can never be certainly known to be
the true Church by those indications and signs which
they offer to the world as her characteristick notes.
S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his excellent Book <hi>De Vnitate Ecclesiae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. de Vnit. Eccles. cap. &amp; cap. 17. Ergo in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturis Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis eam (Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam) requira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. cap. 3.</note>
affirms, that the Church is no whereto be found, but
in <hi>Praescripto legis, in prophetarum praedictis, in Psalmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
cantibus, in ipsius Pastoris vocibus; in Evangelista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
praedicationibus &amp; laboribus; hoc est, in omnibus
Sanctorum canonicis authoritatibus;</hi> in the Scriptures
only. And he gives but one great note of it; and that
is, <hi>adhering to the head Jesus Christ;</hi> for the Church is
Christ's body, who by charity are united to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and to Christ their Head; and he that is not a
member of Christ cannot obtain salvation. And he adds
no other mark; but that Christ's Church is not this, or
that, <hi>viz.</hi> not of one denomination; but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
over the face of the earth. The Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> makes adhesion to the head,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Militant lib. 3. cap. <hi>Sect.</hi> Nostra autem Sententia.</note> (not Jesus Christ,
but) the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be of the essential constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church. Now this being the great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi>


                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:64671:68"/>
Church, and indeed of all other Churches of the world;
is so far from being a sign to know the Church by, that
it is apparent, they have no ground of their Faith; but
the great Question of Christendom, and that which is
condemn'd by all the Christian world but themselves, is
their foundation.</p>
                  <p>And this is so much the more considerable, because
concerning very many Heads of their Church, it was
too apparent that they were not so much as members
of Christ, but the basest of Criminals, and Enemies of
all godliness. And concerning others that were not
so notoriously wicked, they could not be certain that
they were members of Christ; or that they were not of
their Father the Devil. The spirit of truth was promis'd
to the Apostles upon condition; and <hi>Judas</hi> fell from it
by transgression. But the uncertainties are yetgreater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adhering to the Pope</hi> cannot be a certain note
of the Church; because no man can be certain, who is
true Pope. For the Pope, if he be a Simoniac, is <hi>ipso
facto</hi> no Pope: as appears in the Bull of <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi>
And yet besides that he himself was called a most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Simoniac, <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> gave an obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his hand upon condition that the Cardinal <hi>d'Este</hi>
would bring over his voices to him and make him Pope,
that he would never make <hi>Hierom Matthew</hi> a Cardinal;
which when he broke, the Cardinal sent his Obligation
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who intended to accuse him of
Simony, but it broke the Pope's heart, and so he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
here, and was reserved to be heard before a more
Unerring Judicatory. And when <hi>Pius Quartus</hi> used
all the secret arts to dissolve the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and
yet not to be seen in it, and to that purpose dispatch'd
away the Bishops from <hi>Rome,</hi> he forbad the Archbishop
of <hi>Turris</hi> to go,<note place="margin">Hist. Concil. Trid. lib. 7, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his opinion for the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of the Residence
of Bishops; he at the same time durst not trust the Bishop


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64671:69"/>
of <hi>Cesena,</hi> for a more secret reason; but it was known
enough to many. He was a familiar friend of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Naples,</hi> whose Father the Count of <hi>Montebello</hi>
had in his hand an Obligation, which that Pope had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Cardinal for a sum of money for his Voice
in the Election of him to the Papacy. And all the
world have been full of noises and Pasquils, sober and
grave, Comical and Tragical accusations of the Simony
of the Popes for divers ages together; and since no
man can certainly know that the Pope is not Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal,
no man can safely rely on him as a true Pope,
or the true Pope for an infallible Judge.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Pope be a Heretick, he is <hi>ipso facto,</hi> no Pope;
now that this is very possible <hi>Bellarmine</hi> supposes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he makes that one of the necessary cases in which
a General Council is to be called; as I have shewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.
And this uncertainty is manifest in an instance
that can never be wip'd off; for when <hi>Liberius</hi> had
subscrib'd Arianism, and the condemnation of S. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
and the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy had depriv'd <hi>Liberius</hi> of
his Papacy, S. <hi>Felix</hi> was made Pope; and then either
<hi>Liberius</hi> was no Pope, or S. <hi>Felix</hi> was not; and one
was a Heretick, or the other a Schismatick; and then
as it was hard to tell who was their Churches head, so
it was impossible that by adherence to either of them,
their subjects could be prov'd to be Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>3. There have been many Schisms in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and many Anti-popes which were acknowledged
for true and legitimate by several Churches and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
respectively; and some that were chosen into
the places of the depos'd even by Councils, were a
while after disown'd and others chosen; which was
a known case in the times of the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi>
and <hi>Basil.</hi> And when a Council was sitting, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Question, who had power to chuse; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
or the Cardinals? What man could cast his hopes


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64671:69"/>
of Eternity upon the adherence to one, the certainty
of whose legitimation was determin'd by power and
interest, and could not, by all the learning and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christendom?</p>
                  <p>4. There was one Pope who was made head of the
Church before he was a Priest: It was <hi>Constantine</hi> the
second; who certainly succeeded not in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
when he was not capable of his Chair; and
yet he was their head of the Church for a year; but
how adherence to the Pope should then be a note of
the Church, I desire to know from some of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Lawyers; for the Divines know it not. I will not trouble
this account with any questions about the Female-head
of their Church; I need not seek for matter, I am
press'd with too much; and therefore I shall omit very
many other considerations about the nullities, and
insufficiencies, and impieties, and irregularities of many
Popes; and consider their other notes of the Church,
to try if they can fix this inquiry upon any certainty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckons fifteen notes of the Church. It
is a mighty hue and cry after a thing that he pretends
is visible to all the world. 1. The very name <hi>Catholick,</hi>
is his first note: he might as well have said the word
<hi>Church,</hi> is a note of the Church; for he cannot be
ignorant but that all Christians who esteem themselves
members of the Church, think and call themselves mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Catholick Church; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> give the
same title to their Churches. Nay all Conventions of
Hereticks anciently did so; and therefore I shall quit <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
of this note by the words of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> which
himself<note n="*" place="margin">Bellarm. l. 4. de Notis Eccles. cap. 1. Lact. lib. 3. Divinar. insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. cap. ult.</note> also (a little forgetting himself) quotes.
<hi>Sed tamen singuli quique Haereticorum coetus, se potissimum
Christianos, &amp; suam esse Catholicam Ecclesiam putant.</hi>
2. Antiquity indeed is a note of the Church, and
<hi>Salmeron</hi> proves it to be so, from the Example of <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> most learnedly. But it is certain, that God


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64671:70"/>
had a Church in Paradise, is as good an argument for the
Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as for <hi>Rome;</hi> for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from them as certainly as do the <hi>Italians,</hi> and have
as much of <hi>Adam</hi>'s religion as they have. But a Church
might have been very ancient, and yet become no
Church; and without separating from a greater Church.
The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> is the great example; and the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unless she takes better heed, may be
another.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 20, 21.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath plainly threatned it to the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. Duration is made a note, now
this respects the time past, or the time to come. If the
time past, then the Church of <hi>Britain</hi> was Christian
before <hi>Rome</hi> was; and blessed be God are so at this
day. If Duration means the time to come; for so <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
says,<note place="margin">Denotis Eccles. lib. 4. cap. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Ecclesia dicitur Catholica, non solùm quia
semper fuit, sed etiam quia semper erit:</hi> so we have a
rare note for us who are alive to discern the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Catholick Church, and we may
possibly come to know it by this sign many ages after
we are dead; because she will last always. But this sign
is not yet come to pass; and when it shall come to pass,
it will prove our Church to be the Catholick Church,
as well as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church as well as
both of us; for these Churches, at least some of them,
have begun sooner, and for ought they, or we know,
they all may so continue longer. 4. <hi>Amplitude</hi> was
no note of the Church when the world was <hi>Arian;</hi>
and is as little now, because that a great part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
is Papal. 5. Succession of Bishops is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
conservatory of Christian doctrine, but it is as
notorious in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church as in the <hi>Roman;</hi> and
therefore cannot signifie which is the true Church,
unless they be both true, and then the Church of
<hi>England</hi> can claim by this tenure, as having since her
being Christian, a succession of Bishops never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
but, as all others have been, in persecution.


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64671:70"/>
6. <hi>Consent in doctrine with the Ancient Church</hi> may be
a good sign or a bad, as it happens; but the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not, and never can prove, the pure and
prime Antiquity to be of her side. 7. <hi>Vnion</hi> of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
among themselves and with their head, is very
good; if the members be united in truth (for else
it may be a Conspiracy); and if by <hi>head</hi> be meant Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; and indeed this is the onely true sign of
the Church: but if by <hi>head</hi> be meant the <hi>Roman Pope,</hi>
it may be <hi>Ecclesia Malignantium,</hi> and Antichrist may
sit in the chair. But the uncertainty of this note, as it
relates to this question, I have already manifested; and
what excellent concord there is in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> we are taught by the Question of supremacy of
Councils or Popes; and now also by the strict and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
concord between the <hi>Jansenists</hi> and <hi>Molinists;</hi>
and the abetters of the immaculate conception of the
B. Virgin-Mother, with their <hi>Antagonists.</hi> 8. <hi>Sanctity
of doctrine</hi> is an excellent note of the Church: but
that is the question amongst all the pretenders; and
is not any advantage to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unless it
be a holy thing to worship images, to trample upon
Kings, to reconcile a wicked life with the hopes of
heaven at the last minute, by the charm of external
ministeries; to domineer over Consciences, to impose
useless and intolerable burdens, to damn all the world
that are not their slaves, to shut up the fountains of
salvation from the people; to be easier in dispensing
with the laws of God, than the laws of the Church;
to give leave to Princes to break their Oaths; as Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> did to <hi>Francis</hi> the first of <hi>France</hi> to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

<hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> sending him an absolution for
his treachery against the King of <hi>France;</hi> not to keep
faith with hereticks; to find out tricks to entrap them
that trusted to their letters of safe conduct; to declare


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64671:71"/>
that Popes cannot be bound by their promises: for
Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in a Conclave, <hi>A. D. 1555.</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of them that said he could make but four Cardinals,<note place="margin">Hist. Concil. Trident. lib. 5.</note>
because (forsooth) he had sworn so in the Conclave;
saying, This was to bind the Pope, whose authority is
absolute, that it is an Article of faith that the Pope
cannot be bound, much less can he bind himself; that
to say otherwise was a manifest heresie; and against
them that should obstinately persevere in saying so, he
threatned the Inquisition. These indeed are holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
taught and practis'd respectively by their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and indeed are the notes of their
Church; if by the doctrine of the head to whom they
are bound to adhere, we may guess at the doctrine of
their body. 9. <hi>The prevalency of their doctrine</hi> is
produc'd for a good note; and yet this is a greater
note of <hi>Mahumetanism,</hi> than of Christianity; and was
once of <hi>Arianism:</hi> and yet the Argument is not now so
good at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was before <hi>Luther</hi>'s time. 10. That
<hi>the chiefs of the Pope's religion liv'd more holy lives
than others,</hi> gives some light that their Church is the
true one. But I had thought that their Popes had been
the chiefs of their religion, till now; and if so, then
this was a good note while they did live well; but
that was before Popery: Since that time, we will guess
at their Church by the holiness of the lives of those
that rule and teach all; and then if we have none to
follow amongst us, yet we know whom we are to fly
amongst them. 11. <hi>Miracles</hi> were in the beginning of
Christianity a note of true believers;<note place="margin">Marc. 16. 17.</note> Christ told us so.
And he also taught us that Antichrist should be revealed
in lying signs and wonders; and commanded us by that
token to take heed of them. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
would take it ill, if we should call them, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> did
the Donatists, <hi>Mirabiliarios</hi> Miracle-mongers; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which he that pleases to read that excellent Tract


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64671:71"/>
of S. <hi>Austin, De Vnitate Ecclesiae, cap. 14.</hi> will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
satisfied in this particular, and in the main
ground and foundation of the Protestant Religion. In
the mean time,<note place="margin">Tom. 13. p. 193.</note> it may suffice, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> says,
Miracles are a sign of the true Church; and <hi>Salmeron</hi>
says, that they are no certain signs of the true Church;
but may be done by the false. 12. <hi>The Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi>
is also a prety sure note of the true Church, and
yet, in the dispute between <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah, Samaria</hi>
and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it was of no force, but was really in
both. And at the day of Judgment Christ shall reject
some, who will alledge that they prophesied in his
name. I deny that not but there have been some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in the Church of <hi>Rome, Johannes de Rupe seissâ.
Anselmus Marsicanus; Robert Grosthead,</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> S. <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> Abbot <hi>Joachim;</hi> whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
and pictures prophetical were published by
<hi>Theophrastus Paracelsus,</hi> and <hi>John Adrasder,</hi> and by
<hi>Paschalinus Rigeselmus</hi> at <hi>Venice 1589;</hi> but (as <hi>Ahab</hi>
said concerning <hi>Micaiah)</hi> these do not prophesy good
concerning <hi>Rome,</hi> but evil: and that <hi>Rome</hi> should be
reformed <hi>in ore gladii cruentandi</hi> was one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies;
and, <hi>Vniversa Sanctorum Ecclesia abscondetur,</hi>
that the whole Church of the Saints shall be hidden,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the days of Anti-christ; and that in the days of
darkness, the elect of God shall have that faith, or wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to themselves, which they have; and shall not
dare to preach it publickly,] was another prophecy,
and carries its meaning upon the forehead, and many
more I could tell; but whether such prophesies as
these be good signs that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true
Church, I desire to be informed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors,
before I trouble my self any further to consider the
particulars. 13. Towards the latter end of this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of wonderful signs, the <hi>confession of adversaries</hi>
is brought in for a note; and no question, they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64671:72"/>
it so! But did ever any Protestant, remaining so, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Catholick
Church? Let the man be nam'd, and a sufficient testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
brought, that he was <hi>mentis compos,</hi> and I will
grant to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this to be the best note
they have. 14. But since the enemies of the Church
have all had tragical ends; it is no question but this
signifies the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the only Church.
Indeed if all the Protestants had died unnatural deaths;
and all the Papists, nay if all the Popes had died quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their Beds, we had reason to deplore our sad cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and inquir'd after the cause; but we could never
have told by this: for by all that is before him, a man
cannot tell whether he deserves love or hatred. And
all the world finds, that, As dies the Papist, so dies the
Protestant; and the like event happens to them all:
excepting only some Popes have been remark'd by their
own Histories, for funest and direful deaths. 15. And
lately, Temporal Prosperity is brought for a note of
the true Church; and for this there is great reason: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Cross is the high-way to Heaven, and Christ
promised to his Disciples for their Lot in this world
great and lasting persecutions, and the Church felt this
blessing for 300 years together. But this had been a
better argument in the mouth of a <hi>Turkish</hi> Mufty, than
a <hi>Roman</hi> Cardinal.</p>
                  <p>And now if by all these things we cannot certainly
know that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Catholick
Church, how shall the poor <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick be at rest
in his inquiry? Here is in all this, nothing but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of truth, or certainty of error.</p>
                  <p>And what is needful to be added more? I might
tire my self and my Reader, if I should enumerate all
that were very considerable in this inquiry. I shall not
therefore insist upon their uncertainties in their great
and considerable Questions about the number of the


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64671:72"/>
Sacraments: which to be Seven is with them an Article
of Faith; and yet since there is not amongst them any
authentick definition of a Sacrament; and it is not,
nor cannot be a matter of Faith, to tell what is the
form of a Sacrament; therefore it is impossible it should
be a matter of Faith, to tell how many they are: for
in this case they cannot tell the number, unless they
know for what reason they are to be accounted so.
The Fathers and School-men differ greatly in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of a Sacrament; and consequently in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
of them. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard</hi> reckon <hi>wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Disciples feet</hi> to be a Sacrament; and S. <hi>Austin</hi>
called <hi>omnem ritunt cultus Divini,</hi> a Sacrament; and
otherwhile, he says, there are but two: and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
dispute whether or no, a Sacrament can be defin'd.
And by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Clandestine Marriages are
said to be a Sacrament; and yet that the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
detested them: which indeed might very well
be, for the blessed Eucharist is a Sacrament, but yet
private Masses and Communions the Ancient Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
did detest, except in the cases of necessity. But
then, when at <hi>Trent</hi> they declar'd them to be Nullities,
it would be very hard to prove them to be Sacraments.
All the whole affair in their Sacrament of Order, is a
body of contingent propositions. They cannot agree
where the Apostles receiv'd their several Orders, by
what form of words; and whether at one time, or by
parts: and in the Institution of the Lord's Supper, the
same words by which some of them say they were made
Priests, they generally expound them to signifie a duty
of the Laity, as well as the Clergy; <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> which
signifies one thing to the Priest, and another to the
People, and yet there is no mark of difference. They
cannot agree where, or by whom, extreme Unction was
instituted. They cannot tell, whether any Wafer be
actually transubstantiated, because they never can


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64671:73"/>
know by Divine Faith, whether the supposed Priest
be a real Priest, or had right intention; and yet they
certainly do worship it in the midst of all Uncertainties.
But I will add nothing more, but this; what Wonder
is it, if all things in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be Uncertain;
when they cannot, dare not, trust their reason or their
senses in the wonderful invention of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
and when many of their wisest Doctors profess
that their pretended infallibility does finally rely upon
prudential motives?</p>
                  <p>I conclude this therefore with the words of S. <hi>Austin.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Remotis ergo omnibus talibus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Vnit. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. cap. 16.</note> &amp;c. All things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being remov'd, let them demonstrate their
Church if they can, not in the Sermons and Rumors
of the <hi>Africans [Romans,]</hi> not in the Councils of their
Bishops, not in the Letters of any disputers, not in
signs and deceitful Miracles; because against these
things, we are warned and prepar'd by the word of
the Lord: But in the praescript of the Law, of the
Prophets, of the Psalms, of the Evangelists, and all
the Canonical authorities of the Holy Books.]</q> And
that's my next undertaking; to show the firmness of

                  <p>THis question is between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore it supposes
that it is amongst them who believe the Scriptures to
be the Word of God. The Old and New Testament
are agreed upon to be the word of God; and that they
are so, is deliver'd to us by the current descending te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of all ages of Christianity: and they who thus
are first lead into this belief, find upon trial great after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
by arguments both external and internal, and
such as cause a perfect adhesion to this truth; that
<hi>they are Gods Word:</hi> an adhesion (I say) so perfect, as
excludes all manner of practical doubting. Now then
amongst us so perswaded, the Question is, Whether
or no the Scriptures be a sufficient rule of our faith,
and contain in them all things necessary to salvation?
or, Is there any other word of God besides the
Scriptures, which delivers any points of faith or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of life necessary to salvation? This was the
state of the Question till yesterday. And although the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> affirm'd Tradition to be a part of the
object of faith, and that without the addition of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and practises deliver'd by tradition, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
were not a perfect rule; but together with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they are: yet now two or three Gentlemen
have got upon the Coach-wheel, and have raised a

their Seers told them; and Tradition is not onely a
suppletory to the deficiencies of Scripture, but it is
now the onely record of faith. But because this is too
bold and impossible an attempt, and hath lately been
sufficiently reprov'd by some learned persons of our
Church; I shall therefore not trouble my self with
such a frontless errour and illusion; but speak that
truth which by justifying the Scripture's fulness and
perfection will overthrow the doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church denying it, and, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> cast down this
new mud-wall, thrown into a dirty heap by M. <hi>W.</hi>
and his under-dawber M. <hi>S.</hi> who with great pleasure
behold and wonder at their own work, and call it
a Marble Building.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Scripture is a full and sufficient rule to
Christians in faith and manners, a full and perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the will of God, is therefore certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have no other. For if we consider the grounds
upon which all Christians believe the Scriptures to be
the word of God, the same grounds prove that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else is. These indeed have a Testimony that is
credible as any thing that makes faith to men, The
universal testimony of all Christians: In respect of
which S. <hi>Austin</hi> said, <hi>Evangelio non crederem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I should
not believe the Gospel, if the Authority of the Church,</hi>
(that is, of the universal Church) <hi>did not move me.</hi>
The Apostles at first own'd these Writings; the Churches
receiv'd them; they transmitted them to their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
they grounded their faith upon them; they
proved their propositions by them; by them they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
hereticks; and they made them the measures of
right and wrong: all that collective body of doctrines,
of which all Christians consentingly made publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
and on which all their hopes of salvation did
relye, were all contain'd in them; and they agreed in


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64671:74"/>
no point of faith which is not plainly set down in
Scripture. And all this is so certain, that we all profess
our selves ready to believe any other Article which
can pretend and prove it self thus prov'd, thus descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For we know, a doctrine is neither more nor less
the word of God for being written or unwritten; that's
but accidental and extrinsecal to it; for it was first
unwritten, and then the same thing was written; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when it was written it was better conserv'd, and surer
transmitted, and not easily altered, and more fitted to
be a rule. And indeed onely can be so: not but that
every word of God is as much a rule as any word of
God; but we are <hi>sure</hi> that what is so written, and so
transmitted, is <hi>Gods Word;</hi> whereas concerning other
things which were not written, we have no certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
no evident proof, no sufficient conviction; and
therefore it is not capable of being own'd as the rule
of faith or life, because we do not know it to be the
Word of God. If any doctrine which is offer'd to us by
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which is not in Scripture, be
prov'd as Scripture is, we receive it equally: but if it
be not, it is to be received according to the degree
of its probation; and if it once comes to be disputed
by wise and good men, if it came in after the Apostles,
if it rely but upon a few Testimonies, or is to be labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
argued into a precarious perswasion, it cannot
be the true ground of faith; and salvation can never
rely upon it. The truth of the assumption in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
will rely upon an Induction, of which all
Churches have a sufficient experience, there being in
no Church any one instance of doctrine of faith or life,
that can pretend to a clear, universal Tradition and
Testimony of the first and of all ages and Churches, but
onely the doctrine contain'd in the undoubted Books of
the Old and New Testament. And in the matter of
good life, the case is evident and certain; which makes


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64671:75"/>
the other also to be like it; for there is no original or
primary Commandement concerning good life, but it is
plainly and notoriously found in Scripture: Now faith
being the foundation of good life, upon which it is
most rationally and permanently built; it is strange
that Scripture should be sufficient to teach us all the
whole superstructure, and yet be defective in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>Neither do we doubt but that there were many
things spoken by Christ and his Apostles which were
never written; and yet those few onely that were
written, are, by the Divine Providence and the care of
the Catholick Church of the first and all descending
ages, preserv'd to us, and made our Gospel. So that as
we do not dispute, whether the words which Christ
spake, and the Miracles he did, and are not written, be
as holy and as true as those which are written; but
onely say, they are not our rule and measures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are unknown: So there is no dispute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be to be preferr'd or relied upon, as the
<hi>written</hi> or <hi>unwritten</hi> Word of God; for both are to
be relied upon, and both equally; always provided
that they be equally known to be so. But that which
we say, is, That there are many which are called <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which are not <hi>the unwritten Word of God;</hi> at least
not known so to be; and the doctrines of men are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and obtruded as the Commandments of God;
and the Testimonie of a few men is made to support a
weight as great as that which relies upon universal
Testimony; and particular traditions are equall'd to
universal, the uncertain to the certain; and traditions
are said to be Apostolical if they be but ancient; and if
they come from we <hi>know not whom,</hi> they are said to
come from the Apostles; and if <hi>postnate,</hi> they are call'd
<hi>primitive;</hi> and they are argued and laboriously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
into the title of <hi>Apostolical traditions</hi> by not


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64671:75"/>
onely fallible but fallacious arguments (as will appear
in the following numbers.) This is the state of the
Question; and therefore 1. It proves it self, because
there can be no proof to the contrary; since the elder
the tradition is, the more likely it can be prov'd, as
being nearer the fountain, and not having had a
long current; which, as a long line is always the
weakest, so in long descent is most likely to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and therefore a late tradition is one of the
worst arguments in the world; it follows that nothing
can now, because nothing of Faith yet hath been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prov'd.</p>
                  <p>2. But besides this consideration; the Scripture it
self is the best testimony of it's own fulness and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie.
I have already in the Introduction against
<hi>I. S.</hi> prov'd from Scripture, that all necessary things
of salvation are there abundantly contain'd: that is, I
have prov'd that Scripture says so. Neither ought it
to be replyed here; that no man's testimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself is to be accepted. For here we suppose
that we are agreed, that the Scripture says true,
that it is the word of God, and cannot be deceived;
and if this be allow'd, the Scripture then can give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
concerning it self: and so can any Man if you
allow him to be infallible, and all that he says to be
true; which is the case of Scripture in the present
Controversie. And if you will not allow Scripture to
give testimony to it self; who shall give testimony to
it? Shall the Church, or the Pope; suppose which we
will? But who shall give testimony to them? Shall they
give credit to Scripture, before it be known how they
come themselves to be Credible? If they be not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
of themselves, we are not the neerer for their
giving their testimony to the Scriptures. But if it be
said, that the Church is of it self credible upon it's
own authority; this must be prov'd before it can be


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64671:76"/>
ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itted, and then how shall this be proved? And at
least, the Scripture will be pretended to be of it self
credible as the Church. And since it is evident that
all the dignity, power, authority, office, and sanctity it
hath, or pretends to have, can no other way be prov'd
but by the Scriptures, a conformity to them in all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
Laws, and Manners being the only Charter by
which she claims: it must needs be, that Scripture hath
the prior right; and can better be primely credible,
than the Church, or any thing else that claims from
Scripture. Nay therefore, <hi>quoad nos,</hi> it is to be allowed
to be primely credible; because there is no Creature
besides it that is so. Indeed God was pleas'd to find
out ways to prove the Scriptures to be his Word, his
immediate Word, by miraculous consignations, and
sufficient testimony, and confession of enemies, and of
all men that were fit to bear witness that these Books
were written by such men, who by miracle were
prov'd to be <hi>Divini homines,</hi> Men endued with God's
Spirit, and trusted with his Message; and when it was
thus far proved by God, it became the immediate &amp; sole
Ministery of intire Salvation, and the whole Repository
of the Divine will; and when things were come thus far,
if it inquir'd whether the Scriptures were a sufficient
institution to salvation, we need no other, we can have
no better testimony than it self, concerning it self.
And to this purpose I have already brought from it
sufficient affirmation of the point in Question: in the
preceding answer to <hi>I. S.</hi> his first Way in his fourth
<hi>Appendix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It is possible that the Scriptures should contain in
them all things necessary to salvation. God could cause
such a Book to be written. And he did so to the Jews;
he caused his whole Law to be written, he engraved
in Stones, he commanded the authentick Copy to be
kept in the Ark, and this was the great security of


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64671:76"/>
the conveying it; and Tradition was not relied upon:
it was not trusted with any law of Faith or Manners.
Now since this was once done, and therefore is always
possible to be done; why it should not be done now,
there is no pretence of reason, but very much for it.
For 1. Why should the Book of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> be called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and this is also the very
Title of S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Book; and S. <hi>Luke</hi> affirms the design
of his Book is to declare the certainty of the things
then believed, and in which his Friend was instucted,
which we cannot but suppose to be the whole Doctrine
of salvation? 2. What end could there be in writing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
these Books, but to preserve the memory of Christ's
History and Doctrine? 3. Especially if we consider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that many things which were not absolutely necessary
to salvation, were set down; and therefore to omit
any thing that is necessary, must needs be an Unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and Unprofitable way of writing. 4. There yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
never was any Catholick Father that did affirm in terms,
or in full and equivalent sense, that the Scriptures are
defective in the recording any thing necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but Unanimously they taught the contrary, as I
shall shew by and by. 5. The enemies of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
oppos'd themselves against the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Scriptures; and suppos'd by that means
to conclude against Christianity, and they knew no
other repository of it, and estimated no other. 6. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
persecutors of Christianity, intending to destroy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
hop'd to prevail by causing the Bibles to be
burnt; which had been a foolish and unlikely design,
if that had not been the Ark that kept the Records of
the whole Christian Law. 7. That the revealed will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
of God, the Law of Christ, was not written in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
but preached only by word of mouth, is plain,
and reasonable; because all was not finished; and the
salvation of man was not perfected till the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64671:77"/>
Ascension, and Descent of the Holy Ghost; nor was
it done presently. But then it is to be observed, that
there was a Spirit of infallible Record put into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
sufficient for it's publication, and continuance. But
before the death of the Apostles, that is, before this
Spirit of infallibility was to depart, all was written, that
was intended; because no thing else could infallibly
convey the Doctrine. Now this being the case of every
Doctrine as much as of any, and the case of the whole,
rather than of any part of it; it must follow, that it was
highly agreeable to the Divine wisdom, and the very
end of this Oeconomy that all should be written; and
for no other reason could the Evangelists and Apostles
write so many Books.</p>
                  <p>4. But of the sufficiency of Scripture we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
by the very nature of the thing. For the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Salvation being preach'd to all, to the learned
and unlearned; it must be a common Concern, and
therefore fitted to all capacities; and consequently
made easie, for easie learners. Now this design is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signified to us in Scripture by the abbreviatures, the
Symbols and Catalogues of <hi>Credenda:</hi> which are short
and plain, and easie; and to which salvation is promis'd.
Now if <hi>he that believes Jesus Christ to be the Son of
God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 5. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>hath eternal life;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 17. 3.</note> that is, so far as the value and
acceptability of believing does extend, this Faith
shall prevail unto salvation; it follows, that this
being the affirmation of Scripture, and declar'd to
be a competent foundation of Faith; the Scripture
that contains much more, even the whole Oeconomy
of salvation by Jesus Christ, cannot want any necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, when the absolute necessities are so narrow.
<hi>Christ the Son of God</hi> is the great adaequate object of
saving Faith;<note place="margin">John 17. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>to know God, and whom he hath sent Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; this is eternal life.</hi> Now this is the great
design of the Gospel; and is reveal'd largely in the


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64671:77"/>
Scriptures: so that there is no adaequate object of
Faith, but what is there. 2. As to the Attributes of
God, and of Christ, that is, all that is known of them
and to be known is set down in Scripture; That <hi>God is
the rewarder of them that diligently seek him;</hi> that he
is the fountain of wisdom, justice, holiness, power; that
his providence is over all, and mercy unto all: And
concerning Christ; all the attributes and qualifications,
by which he is capable and fitted to do the work of
redemption for us, and to become our Lord, and the
great King of Heaven and Earth; able to destroy all
his Enemies eternally, and to reward his servants with
a glorious and indefectible Kingdom; all this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
in Scripture. So that concerning the full object
of Faith manifested in the whole design of the Gospel,
the Scriptures are full, and whatever is to be believed
of the attributes belonging to this prime and full ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
all that also is in Scripture fully declar'd. And
all the acts of Faith, the antecedents, the formal, and
the consequent acts of faith, are there expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
<hi>viz.</hi> to know God, to believe in his name
and word, to believe in his Son; and to obey his Son,
by the consequent acts of Faith; all this is set down in
Scripture: in which not only we are commanded to
keep the Commandments, but we are told which they
are. There we are taught to honour and fear, to love
and obey God, and his Holy Son; to fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
him, to adore and invocate him, to crave his aid,
and to give him thanks; not to trust in, or call upon
any thing that hath no Divine Empire over us, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Excellence in it self. It is so particular in recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the parts of Duty, that it descends specially
to enumerate the duties of Kings and subjects, Bishops
and people, Parents and children, Masters and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
to show love and faithfulness to our equals; to
our inferiours counsel and help, favour and good will,


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64671:78"/>
bounty and kindness, a good word and a good deed:
The Scripture hath given us Commandments concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our very thoughts; to be thankful and hospitable,
to be humble and complying; what ever good thing
was taught by any or all the Philosophers in the world,
all that and much more is in the Scriptures, and that in
a much better manner: And that it might appear that
nothing could be wanting, the very degrees and the
order of vertues is there provided for. And if all this
be not the high way to salvation, and sufficient to all
intents of God and the souls of men; let any man come
forth and say as Christ said to the young man, <hi>Restat
adhuc unum,</hi> there is one thing wanting yet, and let him
shew it. But let us consider a little further.</p>
                  <p>5. What is, or what can be wanting to the fulness of
Scripture? Is not all that we know of the life and
death of <hi>Jesus,</hi> set down in the writings of the New
Testament? Is there any one Miracle that ever Christ
did, the notice of which is conveyed to us by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Do we know any thing that Christ did or said
but what is in Scripture? Some things were reported
to have been said by Christ secretly to the Apostles,
and by the Apostles secretly to some favourite Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
but some of these things are not believed; and
none of the other is known: so that either we must
conclude that the Scripture contains fully all things of
Faith and Obedience, or else we have no Gospel at all;
for, except what is in Scripture, we have not a sufficient
record of almost one saying, or one miracle. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
quotes one saying of Christ which is not in any of the
four Gospels, but it is in the Scriptures, <hi>It is better to
give then to receive;</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom</hi> records another,
<hi>Be never very glad, but when you see your Brother live
in charity.</hi> If S. <hi>Paul</hi> had not written the first and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it in Scripture, we had not known it any more
than those many other which are lost for not being


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64671:78"/>
written: and for the quotation of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> it is true,
it is a good saying; but whether they were Christ's
words or no, we have but a single testimony. Now
then, how is it possible that the Scriptures should not
contain all things necessary to salvation; when of all
the words of Christ in which certainly all necessary
things to salvation must needs be contain'd, or else
they were never revealed; there is not any one saying,
or miracle, or story of Christ in any thing that is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
preserv'd in any indubitable record, but in Scripture
alone?</p>
                  <p>6. That the Scriptures do not contain in them all
things necessary to salvation, is the fountain of many
great and Capital errours; I instance in the whole
doctrine of the Libertines. Familists, Quakers, and other
Enthusiasts, which issue from this corrupted fountain.
For this, that the Scriptures do need a Suppletory, that
they are not perfect and sufficient to salvation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the great Fundamental both
of the <hi>Roman</hi> religion, and that of the Libertines and
Quakers, and those whom in <hi>Germany</hi> they call <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuales;</hi>
such as <hi>David George, Harry Nicholas, Swenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld,
Sebastian Franc,</hi> and others. <q>These are the men
that call the Scriptures, The letter of the Scripture,
the dead letter, insufficient, inefficacious. This is but
the sheath and the scabberd, the bark and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
a carcase void of the internal light, not apt to
imprint a perfect knowledge in us of what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to salvation.</q> But the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors say the same
things. We know who they are that call the Scriptures,
the <hi>Outward letter, Ink thus figur'd in a book,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Unsensed

blunder and confound, but to clear little or nothing;</hi>
these are as bad words as the other, and some of them
the same; and all draw a long tail of evil consequents
behind them. 1. From this Principle as it is promoted by


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64671:79"/>
the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> they derive a wandring, unsetled, and a
dissolute religion. For, they supplying the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Scripture by an inward word, which being onely
within, it is subject to no discipline, reducible into no
order, not <hi>submitted to the spirits of the Prophets,</hi> and
hath no rule by which it can be directed, examin'd or
judged; Hence comes the infinite variety and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of religion, commenc'd by men of this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
A religion that wanders from day to day, from
fancy to fancy, and alterable by every new illusion. A
religion in which some man shall be esteem'd an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Judge to day; and next week, another: but it
may happen that any man may have his turn, and any
mischief may be believ'd and acted, if the Devil get into
the chair. 2. From this very same Principle, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
by the Papists, they derive a religion imperious,
interested, and tyrannical. For, as the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> supply
the insufficiency of Scripture by the word internal;
so do the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors by the authority of the
Church: but when it comes to practice, as the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
give the supreme power of teaching and defining
to the <hi>chief Elder in the love;</hi> so do the Papists, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Jesuits, give it to the Pope: and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is not, that the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> give the supreme
judgement to some one, and the Papists give it to the
whole Church; for these also give it but to one man,
to the Pope, whose judgement, voice, and definition
must make up the deficiencies of Scripture. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> (as it happens) change their Judge
every moneth, therefore they have an ambulatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
but that of the <hi>Roman</hi> way establishes Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
because their Judge being one, not in person but
in succession, and having always the same interest, and
having already resolved upon their way, and can when
they list go further upon the stock of the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and being established by humane power will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64671:79"/>
persist in their right and their wrong, and
will never confess an Error, and are impatient of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
and therefore they impose irremediably,
and what they please, upon Consciences, of which
they have made themselves Judges. Now for these
things there is no remedy but from Scripture; which
if it be allowed full, perfect, and sufficient unto all the
things of God, then whatsoever either of these parties
say, must be tried by Scripture, it must be shewed
to be there, or be rejected. But to avoid the trial
there, they tell you the Scripture is but a dead letter,
Unsensed Characters, words without sense, or unsensed;
and therefore, this must be supplied by the inward
word (says one;) by the Pope's word in <hi>Cathedrâ,</hi> says
the other; and then both the Inward word, and the
Pope's word, shall rule and determine every thing; and
the Scriptures will signifie nothing: but as under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>the word Internal,</hi> every new thing shall pass
for the word of God; so it shall do also under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
pretence. For not he that makes a Law, but he
that expounds the Law, gives the final measures of Good
or Evil. It follows from hence that nothing but the
Scripture's sufficiencie, can be a sufficient limit to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
of evils, which may enter from these parties
relying upon the same false Principle. My Last argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is from Tradition it self: For,</p>
                  <p>7. If we enquire upon what grounds the primitive
Church did rely for their whole Religion, we shall find
they knew none else but the Scriptures; <hi>Vbi Scriptum?</hi>
was their first inquiry: <q>Do the Prophets and the
Apostles, the Evangelists, or the Epistles say so?</q>
Read it there, and then teach it; else reject it: they
call upon their Charges in the words of Christ, <hi>Search
the Scriptures;</hi> they affirm that the Scriptures are full,
that they are a perfect Rule, that they contain all
things necessary to salvation: and from hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
all Heresies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:64671:80"/>
This I shall clearly prove by abundant testimonies:
Of which though many of them have been already
observ'd by very many learned persons; yet because
I have added others, not so noted, and have collected
with diligence and care, and have rescued them from
Elusory answers; I have therefore chosen to represent
them together; hoping they may be of more usefulness
than trouble, because I have here made a trial, whether
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be in good earnest or no, when she
pretends to follow Tradition; or how it is that she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
a tradition shall be prov'd. For this Doctrine of
the Scripture's sufficiency I now shall prove by a full
tradition; therefore, if she believes Tradition, let her
acknowledge this tradition which is so fully prov'd;
and if this do not amount to a full probation, then it
is but reasonable to expect from them, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obtrude upon us any thing for tradition, or any
tradition for necessary to be believed, till they have
proved it such; by proofs more, and more clear, than
this Essay concerning the sufficiency and perfection of

that the Scriptures are a certain, and the only, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of these things; they are the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64671:81"/>
rule of judging the controversies of faith; that</hi> the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
Ecclesiastical, <hi>that is,</hi> the whole doctrine taught
by the Church of God, and preach'd to all men, <hi>is in the
Scripture; and therefore that it is the plenary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
repository of tradition, that is, of the doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
by Christ and his Apostles: and they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not these, are Impious. And lest any man should
say that, suppose Scripture do contain all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, yet it is necessary that tradition,
or some infallible Church do expound them, and then
it is as long as it is broad, and comes to the same issue;
S.</hi> Clement <hi>tells us how the Scriptures are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
saying, that they who rely upon them, must
expound Scriptures by Scriptures, and by the analogy of
faith,</hi> Comparing spiritual things with spiritual, <hi>one
place with another, a part with the whole, and all by
the proportion to the Divine Attributes. This was
the way of the Church in S.</hi> Clement'<hi>s time; and this is
the way of our Churches. But let us see how this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
went in other Churches and times, and whether
there be a succession and an Universality of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of</hi> the sufficiency of Scripture <hi>in all the affairs
of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next is <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contr. Hermog. cap. 22.</note> who writing against <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
that affirm'd God made the world not out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but of I know not what praeexistent matter;
appeals to Scripture in the Question, whose fulness
<hi>Tertullian</hi> adores; <hi>Let the shop of Hermogenes show that
this thing is written. If it be not written, let him fear
the Wo pronounc'd against them that adde to or take
from Scripture.]</hi> Against this testimony it is objected,
that here <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks but of one question:<note place="margin">De verb. Dei, lib 4. c. 11. Sect.</note> So <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
answers: and from him <hi>E. W.</hi> and <hi>A. L.</hi> To
which the reply is easie:<note place="margin">Profert unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimo.</note> For when <hi>Tertullian</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
<hi>Hermogenes</hi> to show his proposition in Scripture,
he must mean that the fulness of the Scripture was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64671:82"/>
not onely for this, but for all Questions of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or else it had been an ill way of arguing, to bring
a negative argument from Scripture, against this alone.
For why was <hi>Hermogenes</hi> tied to prove this proposition
from Scripture more than any other? Either Scripture
was the rule for all, or not for that. For suppose the
heretick had said, <hi>It is true, it is not in Scripture; but
I have it from tradition,</hi> or it was taught by my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers:
there had been nothing to have replied to
this; but that, It may be, he had no tradition for it.
Now if <hi>Hermogenes</hi> had no tradition, then indeed he
was tied to shew it in Scripture; but then <hi>Tertullian</hi>
should have said, let <hi>Hermogenes</hi> shew where it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
or that it is a tradition: for if the pretending and
proving tradition (in case there were any such pretense
in this Question) had been a sufficient answer; then
<hi>Tertullian</hi> had no sufficient argument against <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
by calling for authority from Scripture: but he
should have said, If it be not <hi>scriptum,</hi> or <hi>traditum,</hi>
written or delivered; let <hi>Hermogenes</hi> fear the wo to
the adders or detracters. But if we will suppose <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
spoke wisely and sufficiently, he must mean,
that the Scripture must be the Rule in all Questions,
and no doctrine is to be taught that is not taught
there. But to put this thing past dispute, <hi>Tertullian</hi>
himself extends this rule to an universal comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
And by this instrument declares, that hereticks
are to be confuted, <hi>[Take from the hereticks that which
they have in common with the heathens; viz.</hi> (their
<hi>Ethnick</hi> learning), <hi>and let them dispute their questions
by Scripture alone, and they can never stand.]</hi> By which
it is plain, that the Scripture is sufficient for all faith,
because it is sufficient to convince all heresies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations
from the faith; For which very reason the
hereticks also (as he observes) attempted to prove their
propositions by arguments from Scripture; for indeed,


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64671:82"/>
there was no other way; because <hi>the Articles of faith
are to be prov'd by the writings of faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Praescript.</note> that is, the
Scripture; <hi>that was the Rule:</hi> How contrary this is to
the practice and doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, we easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find by their Doctors charging all heresies upon the
Scriptures, as occasion'd by them; and forbidding the
people to read them for fear of corrupting their weak
heads; nay, it hath been prohibited to certain Bishops
to read the Scriptures, lest they become hereticks.
And this folly hath proceeded so far that <hi>Erasmus</hi> tells
us of a Dominican,<note place="margin">In Epist.</note> who being urg'd in a Scholastical
disputation, with an argument from Scripture, cried
out, It was a <hi>Lutheran</hi> way of disputation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against the answering it: which, besides that it
is more than a vehement suspicion that these men find
the Scriptures not to look like a friend to their propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions;
it is also a manifest procedure contrary to the
wisdom, religion, and Oeconomy of the primitive

prove them, not as produc'd by their own sentences, but
defended by divine testimonies; for if he so great, and
such an Apostle, believes not that the authority of
his saying can be sufficient, unless he teaches that those
things which he says are written in the Law, and the

does this, it does all that we need; and if it does not,
S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was greatly deceiv'd; and so are we, and
so were all the Church of God in all the first ages.
But he is constant in the same affirmative:<note place="margin">Homil 9. in 2 Timoth.</note>

Scriptures) we learn it. That the man be perfect: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without it he cannot be perfected. In stead of me (he
saith) thou hast the Scriptures; if thou desirest to learn
any thing, hence thou mayest. But if he writes these
things to Timothy, who was fill'd with the holy Spirit,
how much more must we think these things spoken to us?</hi>
To the same purpose he discourses largely in his eighth

because the Arians were never noted to differ from the

upon this as a pitiful shift of a man that resolved to say
any thing rather than confess his errour. And at last he
concludes with many words to the same purpose, <hi>[Our

who in Christianity would receive the firmness of true
faith, should fly to nothing but to the Scriptures; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,

purg'd from these words here quoted (as also from many
others.) But when they cannot show by any probable
argument that any hereticks have interpolated these
words; and that these are so agreeing to other words
of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> spoken in his unquestion'd works; he
shews himself and his party greatly pinch'd, and for no

which are simply necessary to all. He might have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that he speaks of the Lord's Prayer too; and all
the other precepts of the Gospel; and particularly the
eight Beatitudes, and the Sacraments. And what of the
infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Is the belief of
that necessary to all? But that is neither in the Creed,
nor the ten Commandments. And what of the five Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Church; are they plainly in the Scripture?

And beyond faith, hope, and charity, and all things
that integrate them, what a Christian need to know, I
have not learned: But if he would learn more yet; there
are, in places less plain, things enough to make us learned

Scripture hath enough for every one; and in all cases
of necessary Religion; and much more then, what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
nay, there is nothing besides it that can come

I hope I have competently prov'd the tradition I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook;
and by it, that the holy Scriptures contain all
things that are necessary to salvation. The sum is this,
If tradition be not regardable, then the Scriptures alone
are: but if it be regarded, then here is a full Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That the Scriptures are a perfect rule: for that
the Scriptures are the word of God, and contain in them
all the word of God (in which we are concern'd,) is
deliver'd by a full consent of all these, and many other
Fathers, and no one Father denies it; which consent
therefore is so great, that if it may not prevail, the
topick of Tradition will be of no use at all to them
who would fain adopt it into a part of the Canon. But
this I shall consider more particularly.</p>
                  <p>Onely one thing more I am to adde, Concerning the
interpretation and finding out the sense and meaning of
the Scriptures. For though the Scriptures be allowed
to be a sufficient repository of all that is necessary to
salvation; yet we may mistake our way, if we have
not some infallible Judge of their sense.</p>
                  <p>To him therefore that shall ask, How we shall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
and understand the Scriptures? I shall give that
answer which I have learned from those Fathers, whose
testimony I have alleged, to prove the fulness and
sufficiency of Scripture. For if they were never so full,
yet if it be <hi>fons signatus,</hi> and the waters of salvation
do not issue forth, to refresh the souls of the weary,
full they may be in themselves, but they are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for us, nor for the work of God, in the salvation
of man. But that it may appear that the Scriptures are
indeed written by the hand of God, and therefore no
way deficient from the end of their design, God hath
made them plain and easie to all people that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and obedient.</p>
                  <p>So S. <hi>Cyril,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 9. contr. Julian.</note> 
                     <hi>Nihil in Scripturis difficile est iis qui in

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64671:91"/>
our foolish expectations, our carnal fancies, our
interests and partialities make the Scriptures difficult.
The Apostles did not, would not, could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their Master and Lord, when he told them of his
being put to death; They look'd for some other thing:
and by that measure they would understand what
was spoken, and by nothing else. <hi>But to them that are
conversant in Scriptures as they ought, nothing is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult;</hi>
So S. <hi>Cyril:</hi> That is, nothing that is necessary for
them to know; nothing that is necessary to make us
wise unto salvation, which is the great end of man.
To this purpose are the words of S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Psal. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Inclinavit

no interpreter; but a man may find them out himself

So S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and therefore (saith he) what need
is there of a Preacher? All things are clear and plain
out of the Divine Scriptures. But ye seek for Preachers,
because you are nice and delicate, and love to have


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64671:91"/>

words of S. <hi>Cyril. Alex.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>The Divine Scripture is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make them who are educated in it, wise and
most approved, and having a most sufficient understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And to this we need not any foreign teachers.</hi>
There is no question but there are many places in the
Divine Scriptures, mysterious, intricate and secret:
but these are for the learned not the ignorant; for
the curious and inquisitive, not for the busied and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and simple: they are not the repositories of
salvation; but instances of labour, and occasions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and arguments of forbearance, and mutual to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
and an indearment of reverence and adoration.
But all that by which God brings us to himself is plain
and easie. In S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> said, there were
some things hard to be understood; but they were but
<hi>quaedam,</hi> some things; there are enow besides which
are very plain and easie, and sufficient for the instruction
and the perfecting the man of God. S. <hi>Peter</hi> is indeed
suppos'd to say; that in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles some things
were hard; yet if we observe it rightly, he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s writings, and way of expressing himself,
but [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>in which]</hi> relates to the mysterious matters
contain'd in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> of which S. <hi>Peter</hi> also
there treats: the mysteries were so deep and sublime,
so far remov'd from sense and humane experience, that
it is very hard for us, poor ignorants, to understand them
without difficulty, and constancy of labour and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
But then, when such mysterious points occurre,
let us be wary and wise, not hasty and decretory, but
fearful and humble, modest and inquisitive. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
expressed those deep mysteries, of the Coming of
Christ to Judgement, and the conflagration of the
world, as plainly as the things would easily bear; and
therefore the difficulty was not in the style, but in the
subject matter; nor there indeed, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64671:92"/>
so much as by the ignorance and instability, or
unsetledness of foolish people: and although when
things are easie there needs no interpreter, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reading, and observing; and humility and diligence,
simplicity and holiness are the best expositors in the
world; yet when any such difficulty does occurre, we
have a guide sufficient to carry us as farre as we need or
ought to go. Therefore,</p>
                  <p>3. The way of the Ancient and Primitive Church
was to expound the Scriptures by the Scriptures. So
S. <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Stromat. lib. 7. p. 757. &amp; 758.</note> 
                     <hi>perfectly demonstrating out
of the Scriptures themselves concerning themselves:</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>:
<hi>Confirming every thing from those things
which are demonstrated from the Scriptures out of those
and the like Scriptures.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contr. Gentil. in initio.</note> To the same purpose are the
words of S. <hi>Athanasius [The knowledge of true and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
religion and piety does not much need the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of man, and he might abundantly draw this forth
from the Divine books and Letters.]</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of
teaching us to expound Scripture, is, that he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
should do it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, according to the
analogy of faith; the fundamental proportions of faith
are the measures by which we are to exact the sense
and meaning of points more difficult and less necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This way S. <hi>Clement</hi> urges in other expressions.
<q>[Truth is not found in the translation of significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Ubi suprà, pag. 758.</note>
for so they might overthrow all true doctrine:
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
but in this, that every one consider
what is perfectly agreeable to our Lord the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, and what is decent, or fit to be said of him.]</q>
If we follow this way close, our interpretations of
Scripture can never be impious, and can never lead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
dangerous errour.</p>
                  <p>4. In pursuance of this, the Ancient Fathers took


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64671:92"/>
this way, and taught us to do so too; to expound
difficult places by the plain.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de doctr. Christ. cap. 6.</note> So S. <hi>Austin: Magnificè
&amp; salubritèr Spiritus Sanctus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Holy Spirit
hath magnificently, and wholsomly, qualified the Holy
Scriptures, that in the more open</hi> (or plainer) <hi>places,
provision is made for our hunger,</hi> (viz. for our need)
<hi>and in the obscure there is nothing tedious</hi> (or loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.)
<hi>Nihil enim ferè de illis obscuritatibus eruit quod
non planissimè dictum alibi reperiatur. For there is
scarce any thing drawn from those obscure places, but the
same in other places may be found spoken most plainly.]
Bellarmine</hi> observes,<note place="margin">De verbo Dei l. 3. cap. 2. Sect. Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pimis.</note> that S. <hi>Austin</hi> uses the word <hi>ferè,
almost;</hi> meaning, that though by plainer places, most
of the obscure places may be clear'd; yet not all. And
truly it is very probable, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> did mean so.
But then if there be any obscure places that cannot be
so enlightned; what is to be done with them? S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
says,<note place="margin">Lib. de Vnit. Ecclesiae c. 16.</note> that in such places, let every one abound
in his own sense, and expound as well as he can: <hi>quae
obscurè vel ambiguè, vel figuratè dicta sunt, quae
quisque sicut voluerit interpretetur secundum sensum
suum.</hi> But yet still he calls us to the rule of plain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<hi>Talia autem rectè intelligi exponique non possunt
nisi priùs ea quae apertissimè dicta sunt, firma fide te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neantur.</hi>
The plain places of Scripture are the way
of expounding the more obscure, and there is no other,
viz. so apt, and certain.</p>
                  <p>And after all this; I deny not but there are many
other external helps. God hath set Bishops and Priests;
Preachers and Guides of our Souls over us; and they
are appointed to teach others as far as they can, and it
is to be suppos'd they can do it best; but then the way
for them to find out the meaning of obscure places is
that which I have now describ'd out of the Fathers,
and by the use of that means they will be best enabled
to teach others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64671:93"/>
If any man can find a better way than the Fathers
have taught us, he will very much oblige the world by
declaring it; and giving a solid experiment that he can
do what he undertakes. But because no man, and no
company of men, hath yet expounded all hard places
with certaintie and without error; it is an intolerable
vanitie to pretend to a power of doing that which no
charitie hath ever obliged them to do for the good of
the Church, and the glory of God, and the rest of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Souls.</p>

Christ who was born of a Virgin,</hi> was the <hi>old tradition;</hi>
that is, the thing deliver'd, &amp; not at first written; which
the <hi>Barbarians</hi> kept diligently. But <hi>Tradition</hi> signified
either. <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> as it hapned. When it
signified <hi>Preaching,</hi> it was only the first way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
the Religion of Jesus Christ: and untill the
Scriptures were written, and consign'd by the full
testimony of the Apostles, and Apostolical Churches
respectively; they, in the Questions of Religion, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeal'd to the tradition, or the constant retention
of such a doctrine in those Churches where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
first preach'd, and by the succession of Bishops in
those Churches, who without variety or change, had
still remembred and kept the same doctrine, which
at first was deliver'd by the Apostles! <hi>So Irenaeus, If
the Apostles had not left the Scriptures to us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>must
not we</hi> (viz. in this case) <hi>have followed the order
of tradition which they deliver'd to them, to whom
they intrusted the Church; to which ordination many
Nations of Barbarians do assent?</hi> And that which was
true then, is also true now; for, if the Apostles had
never written at all, we must have followed tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
unless God had <hi>provided for us some better
thing.</hi> But it is observable that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> says, That
this way is only in the destitution of Scripture. But
since God hath supplied not only the principal Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with the Scriptures; but even all the Nations
which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> call'd Barbarous; now
to run to Tradition, is to make use of a staff or a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Leg, when we have a good Leg of our own. The
traditions at the first publication of Scriptures were
clear, evident, recent, remembred, talk'd of by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
in all their meetings, publick and private; and
the mistaking of them by those who carefully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to remember them, was not easie; and, if there
had been a mistake, there was an Apostle living, or


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64671:94"/>
one of their immediate Disciples, to set all things right.
And therefore untill the Apostles were all dead,<note place="margin">Heg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was no dispute considerable amongst Christians, but
what was instantly determin'd, or suppress'd; and the

made no great show. But when the Apostles were all
dead; then that Apostasie foretold, began to appear;
and Heresies, of which the Church was warned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to arise. But it is greatly to be remark'd; There
was then no Heresie that pretended any foundation
from Scripture;<note place="margin">Acts 20. 29. 30.</note> but from tradition, many:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 1. &amp;c.</note> for it was
accounted so glorious a thing to have been taught by

to say,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

taught;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 18. 19.</note> and the pretence was very easie to be made
by the Contemporaries or Immediate descendants after
the Apostles;<note place="margin">Jude. 4. v. &amp;c.</note> and now that they were dead, it was so
difficult to confute them, that the Hereticks found it
an easie game to play, to say, They heard it deliver'd
by an Apostle. Many did so, and some were at first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and yet were afterwards discovered; some
were cried down at first, and some expir'd of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and some were violently thrust away. But
how many of those which did descend and pass on to
custome were of a true and Apostolical original, and
how many were not so, it will be impossible to find now;
only, because we are sure there was some false deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this matter, and we know there might be much
more than we have discover'd, we have no reason to
rely upon any tradition for any part of our faith; any
more than we could do upon Scripture, if one Book or
Chapter of it should be detected to be imposture. But
there were two cases, in which tradition was then us'd:
The one was, when the Scriptures had not been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64671:94"/>
or communicated, as among divers nations of the
Barbarians. The other was, when they disputed with
persons who receiv'd not all the Scriptures; as did the
<hi>Carpocratians,</hi> of whom<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 1. &amp;c. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks. In these
cases tradition was urg'd, that because they did not
agree about the authority of one instrument, they
should be admitted to trial upon the other. For as
<hi>Antonius Marinarius</hi> said truly and wisely, The Fathers
served themselves of this topick onely in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
never thinking to make use of it in competition
against holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But then it is to be observ'd, that in both these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the use of tradition is not at all pertinent to the
Question now in hand. For, first, the Question was not
then, as now it is, between personn who equally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Scriptures as the word of God; and to whom
the Scriptures have been from many generations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd.
For they that had receiv'd Scriptures at the first,
relied upon them; they that had not, were to use tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and the topick of succession, to prove their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to have come from the Apostles: that is, they
were fain to call Witnesses, when they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Will in writing. But secondly, in other cases
the old hereticks had the same Question as we have
now.<note place="margin">S. Irenaeus, l. 1. c. 24.</note> For besides the Scripture, they said that, <hi>Jesus
in mystery spake to his disciples and Apostles some things
in secret and apart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. August. tract: 97. in Johan.</note> 
                     <hi>because they were worthy.</hi> And so
Christ said, <hi>I have many things to say, but ye cannot
hear them now.</hi> For this place of <hi>Scripture was to this
purpose urg'd by the most foolish hereticks:</hi> Just thus
do the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day.<note place="margin">De verb. Dei, non script. lib. 4. ca. 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> His notatis.</note> So
<hi>Bellarmine [They preach'd not to the people all things,
but those which were necessary to them, or profitable, but
other things they deliver'd apart to the more perfect.]</hi>
Here then is the popish ground of their traditions;
they cannot deny but necessary and profitable things


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64671:95"/>
were deliver'd in publick, and to all: but some secret
things were reserv'd for the secret ones. For the
Scriptures are as the Credential Letters to an Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour;
but traditions are as the private Instructions.
This was the pretence of the old Hereticks, and is of
the modern Papists: who while they say the same
thing, pretend for it also the same authority, saying,
that Traditions also are to be receiv'd,<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> because they
are recommended in Scripture. Of this I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
give account: In the mean time,</p>
                  <p>Concerning this, I remember that a great man of the
<hi>Roman</hi> party falls foul upon <hi>Castellio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Salmeron tom. 15. in 2 Tim. 3. disp. 4. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>07.</note> for saying, The
Apostle had some more secret doctrine which he did
not commit to writing, but deliver'd it to some more
perfect persons; and that the word of God was not
sufficient for deciding controversies of religion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be expounded, but that a more perfect revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be expected. Upon which he hath these
words, <hi>Intolerabile est, ut Paulus, quam accepit recondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorem
doctrinam, non scripto consignaverit; fuisset
enim alioqui infidelis depositi Minister.</hi> And it was
most reasonable which <hi>Antonius Marinarius,</hi> a Frier
Carmelite, did say, If some things were deliver'd in
secret, it was under secret; because the Apostles might
as well have publish'd it as their disciples: but if it was
deliver'd as a secret, and consequently to be kept as
secret, how came the successors of the Apostles to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
this secret? to break open the seal, and reveal the
forbidden secret? And secondly, If the secret tradition
which certainly was not necessary to all, be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
how shall we know which traditions are necessary,
and which are not? Certain it is, the secret tradition
could not of it self be necessary; and therefore if it
becomes so by being made publick, it is that which the
Apostles intended not, for they would have it secret.
And therefore it follows that now no man can tell that


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64671:95"/>
any of their traditions was intended as necessary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the onely way by which we could know which
was and which was not necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> the making the
one publick and keeping the other private, is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
since they are all alike common. All that which
was delivered to all and in publick, was, by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God ministring apt occasions, and by the Spirit
of God inspiring the Apostles and Evangelists with a
will to do it, set down in writing, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
upon record for ever to all generations of the
Church: So S. <hi>Peter</hi> promis'd to the Jews of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion,
that he would do some thing <hi>to put them in
remembrance of the things he had taught them;</hi> and
he was as good as his word, and imployed S. <hi>Mark</hi> to
write the Gospel: others also of the Apostles took the
same care; and all were directed by God, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
occurrences were concentred in the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and counsel of God.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 1.</note> So S. <hi>Irenaeus, [The Gospel
which the Apostles preach'd, afterwards by the will of
God, they deliver'd to us in the Scriptures.]</hi> It was a
Tradition still; but now the word signified in its
primitive and natural sense, not in the modern and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical.
But <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks of the Gospel;<note place="margin">Tract. 49. in Johan.</note> that is,
the whole Gospel of God: not all the particulars that
<hi>Jesus</hi> spake and did,<note place="margin">S. Augustin. lib. 1. c. 35. de consensu Evangel.</note> but <hi>[What ever Christ would have
us to read of his words and works, he commanded them
to write, as if it were by his own hands.]</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Electa sunt quae scriberentur, quaè saluti credentium
sufficere videbantur.</hi> There was a choice made of such
things as were to be written: It was not therefore
done by chance and contingency (as many of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Doctors in disparagement of the Scriptures sufficiency
do object) but the <hi>things were chosen,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin;</hi>
it was <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> said S. <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> and
the choice was very good; all that suffic'd to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of believers: according to the words of S. <hi>John,


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64671:96"/>
These things were written that ye might believe that
Jesus Christ is the Son of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>and that believing ye
might have life through his name.</hi> And indeed there
cannot be any probable cause inducing any wise man to
believe that the Apostles should pretend to write the
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and that they should insert ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things more then necessary, and yet omit any thing
that was, and yet still call it <hi>the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
Nicephorus</hi> calls the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 2. hist. c. 34.</note> A summary of
what he plainly and explicitely did teach; much more
is every Gospel. But when all the four Gospels, and
the Apostolical Acts, and Epistles, and the Visions of
S. <hi>John</hi> were all tied into a Volume, by the counsel of
God, by the dictate of the Holy Spirit, and by the
choice of the Apostles; it cannot be probable that
this should not be all the Gospel of Jesus Christ, all his
Will and Testament.<note place="margin">Contre le Roy Jaq. p. 715.</note> And therefore in vain does the
Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> strive to escape from this by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that the Gospel is the foundation of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as Grammar is the foundation of Eloquence; as the
Institutions of <hi>Justinian,</hi> is of the study of the law; as
the principles and institutions of a science are of the
whole profession of it. It is not, in his sense, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Christian doctrine, but it contains it all; not
onely <hi>in general,</hi> but <hi>in special;</hi> not onely <hi>virtual,</hi> but
<hi>actual;</hi> not <hi>mediate,</hi> but <hi>immediate;</hi> for a few lines
would have serv'd for a foundation <hi>General, virtual</hi> and
<hi>mediate;</hi> If the Scripture had said, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
shall always be the Catholick Church, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of faith; she shall be infallible, and to her all
Christians ought to have recourse for determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Questions; this had been a sufficient vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and mediate foundation: But when four Gospels
containing Christs Sermons and his Miracles, his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and his Promises; the Mysteries of the Kingdom,
and the way of Salvation; the things hidden from


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64671:96"/>
the beginning of the world, and the glories reserv'd
to the great day of light and manifestation of Jesus;
to say, that yet all these Gospels, and all the Epistles of
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> and the Acts
and Sermons of the Apostles, in the first establishing the
Church, are all but a foundation virtual; and that
they point out the Church indeed, by saying, she is <hi>the
pillar and ground of truth;</hi> but leave you to her for the
foundation actual, special and immediate; is an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
against the notoreity of fact. Add to this, that
S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> spake these words concerning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 2.</note>
in confutation of them, who leaving the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
did run to Traditions, pretendedly Apostolical.</p>
                  <p>And though it be true, that the traditions they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
upon were secret, Apocryphal, forg'd and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
yet because even at that time there were such
false wares obtruded, and even then the Hereticks
could not want pretences sufficient to deceive, and
hopes to prevail; How is it to be imagined, that in
the descent of sixteen ages, the cheat might not be
too prevalent? when, if the traditions be question'd,
it will be impossible to prove them; and if they be
false, it will (except it be by Scripture) be impossible
to confute them. And after all; if yet there be any
doctrines of faith or manners which are not contain'd
in Scripture, and yet were preach'd by the Apostles,
let that be prov'd, let the traditions be produc'd,
and the records sufficient, primely credible and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
and we shall receive them. So vain a way
of arguing it is, to say, The Traditions, against which
S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks, were false, but ours are true; Theirs
were secret, but ours were open and notorious: For
there are none such: And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that the necessary things are deliver'd in
Scriptures; and those which were reserv'd for tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were deliver'd apart; that is, secretly by the


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64671:97"/>
Apostles. Now if they were so on all sides; what rule
shall we have to distinguish the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Traditions

than those; since all must be equally taken upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
testimony at first? And although it will be said,
That the <hi>Roman</hi> Traditions were receiv'd by after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
and the other were not: yet this shews no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but that some had the fate to prevail, and
others had not. For it is certain; that some were a
long time believ'd, even for some whole ages, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Apostolical Tradition; (as the <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
opinion, and the <hi>Asiatick</hi> manner of keeping
Easter) which yet came to be dis-believ'd in their time:
and also, it is certain that many which really were <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical</hi>
Traditions, perished from the memory of men,
and had not so long lives, as many that were not: So
that all this is by chance, and can make no difference
in the just authority. And therefore it is vainly said
of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> That the case is not the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
theirs are wrong, and ours are right. For this
ought not to have been said, till it were prov'd; and
if it were prov'd, the whole Question were at an end:
for we should all receive them which were manifested
to be doctrines <hi>Apostolical.</hi> But in this, there need no
further dispute from the authority of <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> his
words concerning the fulness of Scripture, as to the
whole doctrine of Christ, being so clear and manifest,
as appears in the testimonies brought from him in the

and <hi>but by these</hi> we shall never know the will of the
<hi>Testator.</hi> But because the Books of Scripture were
not all written at once; nor at once communicated,


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64671:97"/>
nor at once receiv'd, therefore the Churches of God at
first, were forc'd to trust their memories, and to try
the doctrines, by appealing to the memories of others;
that is, to the consenting report, and faith deliver'd
and preach'd to other Churches, especially the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
where the memory of the Apostles was recent, and
permanent. The mysteriousness of Christ's Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
the perfection of his sacrifice, and the unity of it,
Christ's advocation, and Intercession for us in Heaven,
might very well be accounted traditions, before Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was admitted for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
but now they are written truths: and if they had
not been written, it is likely we should have lost them.
But this way could not long be necessary, and could
not not long be safe. <hi>Not necessary,</hi> because it was
supplied by a better; and to be tied to what was only
necessary in the first state of things, is just as if a man
should always be tied to suck milk, because at first in
his infancy, it was fit he should. <hi>Not safe,</hi> because it
grew worse and worse every day. And therefore in
a little while, even the Traditions themselves were so
far from being the touch-stone of true doctrine, that
themselves were brought to the stone of trial; And
the Tradition would not be admitted, unless it were in
Scripture. By which it appears, that Tradition could not
be a part of the rule of faith, distinct from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but it self was a part of it; that is, whatsoever
was deliver'd and preach'd, was recorded; which they
so firmly believed, that they rejected the Tradition,
unless it were so recorded: and 2. It hence also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that Tradition was, and was esteemed, the
worse way of conveying propositions and stories; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Church requir'd that the Traditions should
be prov'd by Scriptures; that is, the less certain by
the more:<note place="margin">Epist. ad Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peium contra epist. Stephani.</note> That this was so, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is a sufficient

come from the Gospels, or the Epistles, or the Acts of the

                     <note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 8.</note>
which are greatly conclusive of this Inquiry. <hi>[We
have</hi> (saith he) <hi>promis'd that we would propose the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the old Ecclesiastical Presbyters and Writers; by

whom was <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> says the Latin version.</p>
                  <p>But I shall descend to a consideration of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which pretend to come to us by tradition, and
without it cannot (as it is said) be prov'd by Scripture.</p>
                  <p>1. It is said that the Scripture it self is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to us by tradition; and therefore, besides Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Tradition is necessary in the Church. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no man that understands this Question, denies it:
This tradition, that these books were written by the
Apostles, and were deliver'd by the Apostles to the
Churches as the word of God, relies principally upon
Tradition Universal; that is, it was witnessed to be true
by all the Christian world at their first being so consign'd.
Now then this is no part of the word of God; but the
notification, or manner of conveying the word of God;
the instrument of it's delivery. So that the tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64671:98"/>
the Scripture's being extrinsecal to Scripture is
also extrinsecal to the Question; This Tradition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be an objection against the sufficiency of Scripture
to salvation: but must go before this question. For no
man inquires, Whether the Scriptures contain all things
necessary to salvation? unless he believe that there are
Scriptures; that these are they; and that they are the
word of God: All this comes to us by Tradition, that
is, by universal undeniable testimony. After the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are thus receiv'd, there is risen another Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> Whether or no these Scriptures so deliver'd
to us, do contain all the word of God; or, Whether
or no, besides the Tradition that goes before Scripture,
which is an instrumental Tradition onely of Scripture,
there be not also something else that is necessary to
salvation consign'd by Tradition, as well as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
and of things as necessary or useful as what is
contain'd in Scripture, and that is equally the Word
of God as Scripture is? The Tradition of Scripture we
receive; but of nothing else but what is in Scripture.
And if it be ask'd,<note place="margin">It is therefore weakly said by <hi>E. W.</hi> pag 5. If he says, that he impugns all tradition in General, all doctrine not expressly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Scripture; forced he is to throw away Scripture it self, &amp;c.</note> Why we receive
one, and not the rest: we answer,
because we have but one Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things necessary; that is,
there is an Universal Tradition of
Scripture, and what concerns it; but none of other
things which are not in Scripture: And there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
we should have any; all things necessary and
profitable to the salvation of all men, being plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in Scriptures; and this sufficiency also, being
part of that Tradition as I am now proving.</p>
                  <p>But because other things also are
pretended to be,<note place="margin">E. W. <hi>ibid.</hi> He is forc'd not onely to throw away Scripture it self, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; not only to disclaim a Trinity of persons in one Divine essence, Baptizing of children, &amp;c. but every tenet of Protestant religion (as Protestantism,) <hi>E. g.</hi> The belief of two Sacraments onely, &amp;c.</note> or are necessary,
and yet are said not to be in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
it is necessary that this
should be examin'd, 1. First, all the


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64671:99"/>
Nicene definitions, Trinity of persons in one Divine
essence. This I should not have thought worthy of
considering in the words here expressed, but that a
friend,<note place="margin">The same also he says concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene and the other three Councils, and S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> Creed <hi>p. 8.</hi>
                     </note> it seems, of my own, whom I know not, but
yet an adversary, as he who should know him best
(that is, himself) assures me, is pleas'd to use these
words in the objection. To this I answer first, that this
Gentleman would be much to seek if he were put to
it, to prove the Trinity of persons in one Divine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
to be an express Nicene definition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if he means that as an instance of the Nicene defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
he will find himself mistaken. Indeed at <hi>Nice,</hi>
the Consubstantiality of the Father and the Son was
determin'd; but nothing of the Divinity of the holy
Ghost, That was the result of after-Councils. But
whatever it was which was there determin'd, I am sure
it was not determin'd by tradition, but by Scripture.
So S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells us of the faith which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
by the Nicene Fathers;<note place="margin">Epist. ad Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctet. Corinth. Episc.</note> it was the faith <hi>confess'd
according to the holy Scriptures:</hi> and speaking to <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi>
of the holy Trinity,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. ad Serap. de Spir. S. Id. de Incarnat.</note> he says, <hi>Learn this out of the
holy Scriptures. For the documents you find in them, are
sufficient.</hi> And, writing against <hi>Samosatenus,</hi> he proves
the Incarnation of the Son of God out of the Gospel
of S. <hi>John,</hi> saying, <hi>It becomes us to stick close to the word
of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theodoret. l. 1. c. 7.</note> And therefore when <hi>Constantine</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
exhorted the Nicene Fathers to concord in the
question then to be disputed; they being Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he would they should be ended by the authority
of the Divine Scriptures. <hi>[For,</hi> saith he, <hi>the books of
the Evangelists and Apostles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Et apud Gelas. Cyzicen. in actis Concil. Nicen. l. 2. c. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>as also the Oracles of the
old Prophets, do evidently teach us what we are to think
of the Deity. Therefore all seditious contention being
laid aside, let us determine the things brought into
question by the testimonies of the divinely inspired
Scriptures.]</hi> And they did so. And by relying on


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64671:99"/>
Scriptures onely, we shall never be constrain'd to quit
these glorious portions of Evangelical truth, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of the eternal Word, and the Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of the Father and the Son. <hi>Whatsoever ought
to be known of these mysteries is contain'd in both Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments;</hi>
saith <hi>Rupertus Tuitiensis,</hi> before quoted.
And if the holy Scriptures did not teach us in these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
we should find Tradition to be but a lame leg, or
rather a reed of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

pretend to it, though not always; and this shews
that there was no clear, indubitate, notorious, universal
Tradition in the Question; and if there were not such
an one, as good none at all; for it could not be such a
foundation as was fit to build our faith upon, especially
in such mysterious articles. But it is remarkable what
<hi>Eusebius</hi> recites out of an old Author, who wrote
against the heresie of <hi>Artemon,</hi> which afterwards <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satenus</hi>
renewed, and <hi>Arius</hi> made publick with some
alteration <hi>[They all say</hi> (says he) <hi>that our Ancestors and

that which was said by them might seem to have in it


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64671:100"/>
much of probability, if the Divine Scriptures did not
first of all contradict them, and that there were wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of some Brethren elder than the times of Victor.</hi>
The Brethren, whose writings he names, are, <hi>Justin,

From all which it is evident; that the Questions at
<hi>Nice,</hi> were not, and could not be determin'd by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2. That Tradition might be, and was pretended on
both sides. 3. That when it is pretended by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
parties with some probability, it can effectually
serve neither. 4. That the Tradition the <hi>Samosatenians</hi>
and <hi>Arians</hi> boasted of, had in it much probability,
when look'd upon in it's own series and proper state.
5. That the <hi>Divine Scriptures</hi> were at that time, the
best firmament of the Church, and defended her from
that abuse, which might have been impos'd upon her,
under the title of Tradition. 6. That even when
tradition was oppos'd to tradition, and the right to the
wrong, yet it was not Oral or Verbal tradition (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the new mode) but the writings of the Doctors
that were before them. But after all this, I cannot
but observe and deplore the sad consequents of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Doctors pretention that, This <hi>great mystery of
Godliness, God manifested in the Flesh,</hi> relies wholly
upon unwritten traditions. For the <hi>Socinians,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that tradition was on both sides claim'd in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
please themselves in the Concession of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
that this is not to be prov'd by Scripture.
So they alledge the testimony of <hi>Eccius,</hi> and Cardinal

affirm'd by <hi>Tanner,</hi> and all that were on that side, in

and others. Now they being secur'd by their


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64671:100"/>
very enemies, that they need not fear Scriptures in this
question; and knowing of themselves that tradition
cannot alone do it; they are at peace, and dwell in
confidence in this their Capital Error: and the false
peace is owing to the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors; who in <hi>Italy</hi>

do too freely declare, that not one of those hundred
prove the Question.</p>
                  <p>2. The next necessary Article pretended to stand
upon Tradition, is, The baptizing Children. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, I consider either the matter of fact, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of doctrine. The matter of fact is indifferent, if
abstracted from the doctrine. For at the first, they
did, or they did not, according as they pleased; for
there is no pretence of Tradition, that the Church in
all ages, did baptize all the Infants of Christian Parents:
It is more certain, that they did not do it always, than
that they did it in the first age. S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi>
and S. <hi>Austin</hi> were born of Christian Parents, and yet
not baptiz'd untill the full age of a man, and more.
But that the Apostles did baptize any Children, is not
at all reported by a primely credible Tradition, or a
famous report: but that they did so is only conjectur'd
at; or if it be more, yet that more, whatsoever it be,
relies upon the testimony of Scripture; as S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
the housholds of <hi>Stephanas,</hi> and the Jaylor. But
then if they did, or if they did not, yet without an
appendant doctrine, this passes on by the voluntary
practise of the Church; and might be, or not be, as
they pleas'd; as it was in the case of confirming them,
and communicating them at the same time they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
them; Concerning which, because we live to have
seen and read of several Customs of the Church


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64671:101"/>
in several ages; it is also after the same manner in
baptism, if we consider it only in the matter of fact.</p>
                  <p>But then if we consider the doctrine appendant to it,
or the cause why it is pretended they were baptiz'd;
even that children should be brought to Christ, should
receive his blessing, should be adopted into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, should be made members of the second
<hi>Adam,</hi> and be translated from the death introduc'd
by the first, to the life revealed by the second, and
that they may receive the Holy Spirit, and a title to
the promises Evangelical, and be born again, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into a state of Covenant, in which they can receive
the gift of eternal life (which I take to be the proper
reasons, why the Church baptizes Infants:) all these
are wholly deriv'd to us from Scripture-grounds. But
then as to that Reason, upon which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> baptizes Infants, even because it is necessary,
and because without it, children shall not see God; it
is certain there is no Universal, or prime Tradition for
that S. <hi>Austin</hi> was the hard Father of that doctrine. And
if we take the whole doctrine and practice together
without distinction, that it was the custom so to do in
some Churches, and at sometimes, is without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
but that there is a tradition from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
so to do, relies but upon two witnesses, <hi>Origen,</hi>
and S. <hi>Austin;</hi> and the latter having receiv'd it from
the former, it relies wholly upon his single testimony,
which is but a pitiful argument to prove a tradition
Apostolical.<note n="*" place="margin">Secundum Ecelesiae obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantiam (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64671:101"/>
although the tradition be uncertain, weak, little and
contingent; yet the Church of God, when ever she did
it (and she might do it at any time,) did do it upon
Scripture-grounds. And it was but weakly said by
Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Replique à la response du Roy Jaques. p. 701.</note> that There is no place of Scripture
by which we can evidently, and necessarily convince
the Anabaptists. For 1. If that were true, yet it is
more certain, that by Tradition they will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded;
not only because there is no sufficient, and
full tradition; but because they reject the Topick.
2. Although the Anabaptists endeavour to elude the
arguments of Scripture, yet it follows not that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not clear and certain in the Article: for it is an
easie thing, to say something to every thing; but if that
be enough against the argument, then no Heretick can
be convinc'd by Scripture, and there is in Scripure;
no pregnant testimony for any point of faith, for in
all questions, all Hereticks prattle something. And
therefore, it is not a wise procedure, to say; The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
do answer the testimonies of Scripture; and
by Scripture, cannot be convinc'd; and therefore chuse
some other way of probation. For when that is done,
will they be convinc'd? and cannot the Cardinal satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself by Scripture, though the Heretick will not
confess himself confuted? The Papists say, They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Protestants Arguments from Scripture; but
though they say so to eternal ages, yet in the world no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is plainer, than that they only say so; and that,
for all that confident and enforc'd saying, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are still apparently against them. 3. If the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
speak probably, and reasonably in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers;
then it will rather follow, that the point is not
necessary, than that it must be prov'd necessary by
some other Topick. 4. All people that believe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of Infants necessary, think that they sufficiently
prove it from Scripture; and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> though


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64671:102"/>
he also urges this point as an argument for Traditions;
yet, upon wiser thoughts, he proves it, (and not Unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully)
by three arguments from Scripture.</p>
                  <p>3. Like to this, is the pretence of the validity of the
Baptism of Hereticks: It is Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>'s own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and the first of the four he alledges for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Tradition, This he holds for a doctrine Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
and Apostolick; and yet (says he) there is no
word of it in Scripture. Concerning this, I think the
issue will be short; If there be nothing of it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is certain, there was no Apostolical tradition
for it. For S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and all his Collegues were of
an opinion contrary to that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in
this Article;<note place="margin">Epist. ad Pompeium.</note> and when they oppos'd against S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
a Tradition, he knew of no such thing, and bad them
prove their tradition from Scripture. 2. S. <hi>Austin,</hi> who
was something warm in this point, yet confesses, the
Apostles commanded nothing in it; but then he does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
begus to believe, it came from them. <hi>Consuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
illa quae opponebatur Cypriano, ab eorum traditione
exordium sumpsisse credenda est; si cut sunt multa quae
universa tenet Ecclesia, &amp; ob hoc ab Apostolis benè
praecepta traduntur, quanquam scripta non reperiantur:</hi>
which in plain meaning is this; We find a Custome in
the Church, and we know not whence it comes; and
it is so in this, as in many other things; and therefore
let us think the best, and believe it came by tradition
from the Apostles. But it seems, himself was not sure
that so little a foundation could carry so big a weight,
he therefore plainly hath recourse to Scripture in this
Question.<note place="margin">Contra Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist. l. 4. c. 14. &amp;c. 17. &amp; 24.</note> 
                     <hi>[Whether is more pernitious, not to be
baptiz'd, or to be re-baptiz'd, is hard to judge: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
having recourse to the standard of our Lord,
where the monuments of this are not estimated by humane
sense, but by Divine authority, I find concerning each
of them, the Sentence of our Lord;</hi> to wit, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.]


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64671:102"/>
But 3. The Question it self, is not a thing
necessary; for S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and almost two parts of the known
world, whose sentiment was differing from others, yet
liv'd and dyed in the Communion of those Churches,
who believ'd the contrary doctrin: and so it might have
been still, if things were estimated but according to
their intrinsick value.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist. cap. 18.</note> And since, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> says, they
might safely differ in judgment before the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Question in a Council; it follows evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that there was no clear tradition against them; or,
if there were, that was not esteem'd a good Catholick,
or convincing argument. For as it is not imaginable,
so great and wise a part of the Catholick Church
should be ignorant of any famous Apostolical tradition;
especially when they were call'd upon to attend to it,
and were urg'd and press'd by it: so, it is also very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
there was none such in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, because
the sixth general Council approv'd of the Canon made
in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Can. 2.</note> because <hi>in praedictorum
praesulum locis &amp; solum secundùm traditam eis consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem
servatus est.</hi> 4. It had been best, if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
had never been mov'd; and the next best had
been to have suppress'd and forgotten it instantly;
for as it came in by zeal and partiality in the hands of
the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> Bishops, so it was fed by pride and
faction in the hands of the Donatists; and it could
have no determination, but the mere nature of the
thing it self; all the Apostles and Ministers of Religion
were commanded to baptize in water in the name of
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and this was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Christianity, not to any sect of it; and if
this had been consider'd wisely, so it had been done
by a Christian Minister in matter and form, there could
be no more in it. And therefore the whole thing
was to no purpose: so far was it from being an Article
of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64671:103"/>
4. The next pretence is, that the Procession of the
Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, is an Article
of our Faith, and yet no where told in Scripture; and
consequently tradition must help to make up the object
of our Faith. To this some very excellent persons
have oppos'd this Consideration, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Latins</hi> differ but in <hi>modo loquendi;</hi> and therefore both
speaking the same thing in differing words, show, that
the Controversie it self is trifling or mistaken. But
though I wish them agreed; yet when I consider, that
in all the endeavours for Union at the Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
they never understood one another to purposes
of peace; I am apt to believe that those who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
them, shew their piety more than the truth of the
thing, and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> differ'd intirely
in this point. But then that on the Latin side, there
should be a tradition Apostolical, can upon no other
account be pretended, but that they could not prove
it by Scripture, or shew any Ecclesiastical law or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for it. Now if we consider that the <hi>Greeks</hi> pretend
their doctrine, not only from Scripture, but also from
immemorial tradition, that is, that they have not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
the doctrine which their Fathers taught them;
and on the other side, that the <hi>Latins</hi> have, contrary
to the Canon of the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> superadded
the clause of <hi>Filióque</hi> to the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi>-Creed,
and that by authority of a little Convention of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
at <hi>Gentilly,</hi> neer to <hi>Paris,</hi> without the consent
of the Catholick Church; and that by the Confession of
Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contr. le R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y Jaques. p. 709.</note> not only the Scripture favours the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> but Reason also; because it is unimaginable,
that the same particular effect should proceed from two
principles in the same kind; and although the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
created the world, yet that production was from
the Divine essence, which is but one principle; but
the opinion of the <hi>Latius</hi> is, that the Holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64671:103"/>
from two Persons, as Persons, and therefore from
two principles, it will be very hard to suppose, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all this is against them, therefore it is certain,
that they had this from Apostolical tradition. The
more natural consequence is, that their proposition is
either mistaken, or uncertain, or not an article of
Faith, (which is rather to be hop'd, lest we condemn
all the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches as Infidels, or perverse Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,)
or else that it can be deriv'd from Scripture;
which last is indeed the most probable, and pursuant
to the doctrine of those wiser <hi>Latins,</hi> who examin'd
things by reason, and not by prejudice. But Cardinal
<hi>Perron</hi>'s argument is no better than this: <hi>Titius</hi> was
accus'd to have deserted his station in the Battel, and
carried false Orders to the Legion of <hi>Spurinna;</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
I must either have received Orders from the
General, or else you must suppose me to be a Coward, or
a Traytor; for I had no warrant for what I did from the
Book of Military Discipline: Well, what if you be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be a Coward, or Traytor; what hurt is in that
supposition? But must I conclude, that you had Order
from the General, for fear I should think you did it on
your own head, or that you are a Traytor? That's the
case; Either this proposition is deriv'd to us by Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
tradition, or we have nothing else to say for our
selves: well! <hi>Nempe hoc Ithacus velit;</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the argument, and will say thus: You had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say for your selves, unless we grant that to
you which is the Question, and which you can never
prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is for this Article, an Apostolical
tradition: but because both sides pretend that, let us
try this thing by Scripture. And indeed that's the
only way. And Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>'s argument may by any
<hi>Greek</hi> be inverted, and turned upon himself. For he
saying, It is not in Scripture; therefore it is a tradition
of the Church: it is as good an argument; It is not


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64671:104"/>
deliver'd to us by universal Tradition, therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is not at all, or it is deriv'd to us from Scripture:
and upon the account of this, for my part, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it.</p>
                  <p>5. The last instance of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> is the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Lord's Day; but this is matter of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and external rite; and because it cannot pretend
to be an article of faith, or essentially necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the consideration is differnt from the rest.
And it is soon at an end; but that the Cardinal
would fain make some thing of nothing, by telling that
the Jews complain of the Christians for changing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
into Baptism, and the Saturday-sabbath into
the <hi>Dominical,</hi> or Lord's-day: He might as well have
added, They cry out against the Christians for changing
<hi>Moses</hi> into <hi>Christ,</hi> the Law into the Gospel, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works into the Covenant of faith, Ceremonies
into substances, and rituals into spiritualities. And we
need no further inquiry into this Question, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,<note place="margin">Perron ibid. 710.</note>
what the Cardinal says, that <hi>God did the Sabbath
a special honour by writing this ceremonial alone into
the summary of the moral law.</hi> Now I demand, Whether
there be not clear and plain Scripture, for the abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the law of Ceremonies? If there be, then the
law of the Sabbath is abolished. It is part of <hi>the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
of ordinances, which Christ nail'd to his Cross.</hi>
Now when the Sabbath ceases to be obligatory, the
Church is at liberty: but that there should be a time
sanctified, or set apart for the proper service of God,
I hope is also very clear from Scripture; and that the
circumstances of religion are in the power of the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of religion; and then it will follow from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that the Apostles, or their Successors, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
did appoint the Sunday-festival, had not onely
great reason, but full authority, to appoint that day;
and that this was done early, and continued constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64671:104"/>
for the same reason, and by an equal authority, is no
question. But as to the Sabbath, S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave express
order that no man should be judged by any part of the
ceremonial law, and particularly name's the Sabbath-days,<note place="margin">Colos. 2. 16.</note>
saying, <hi>They all were a shadow of things to come,
but Christ is the substance.</hi> And yet after all this, The
keeping of the Lord's-day was no law in Christendom
till the <hi>Laodicean</hi>-Council; but the Jewish Sabbath
was kept as strictly as the Chrisian Lord's-day; and
yet both of them with liberty, but with an intuition
to the avoiding offence, and the interests of religion:
and the Lord's-day came not in stead of the Sabbath,
and it did not succeed in the place of the Sabbath, but
was meerly a Christian festival, and holy day. But at
last; That the keeping of the Lord's-day be a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Apostolical, I desire it were heartily believed by
every Christian; for though it would make nothing
against the sufficiency of Scriptures in all Questions of
faith and rules of manners, yet it might be an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on all men to keep it with the greater religion.</p>
                  <p>6. At the end of this, it is fit I take notice of another
particular offer'd by the By, not in justification of
Tradition, but in defiance of them that oppose it. <hi>If
the Protestants oppose all Tradition in General,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">E. W. <hi>p. 5.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>they must
quit every Tenet of Protestant religion (as Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:)
for Example sake: The belief of two Sacraments
onely,</hi> &amp;c. The charge is fierce, and the stroak is little.
It was unadvisedly said, That every Protestant Doctrine
<hi>quâ talis,</hi> must be quitted if Scripture be the rule: for
this very Proposition, That Scripture is the rule of our
faith, is a main Protestant doctrine; and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
must not be quitted: if Scripture be the rule,
that is, if the doctrine be true it must not be forsaken.
And although in the whole progress of this book,
Protestant religion will be greatly justified by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
yet for the present I desire the Gentleman to


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64671:105"/>
consider a little better about giving the Chalice to all
Communicants; whether their denying it to the Laity
be by authority of Scripture? and I desire him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what place of the Old or New Testament he hath
for worshipping and making the images of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Holy Ghost, or for having their publick
Devotions in an unknown tongue. But of these here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>As to the instance of two Sacraments onley, I desire
the Gentleman to understand our doctrine a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It is none of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
that there are two Sacraments onely; But that, of those
Rituals commanded in Scripture which the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
use calls Sacraments (by a word of art) <hi>Two one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are generally necessary to Salvation.</hi> And although
we are able to prove this by a Tradition much more
Universal, than by which the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors can prove
seven, yet we rely upon Scripture for our Doctrine: and
though, it may be, I shall not dispute it with this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that sends his chartel, unless he had given better
proof of his learning and his temper; yet, I suppose,
if he reads this book over, he shall find something first
or last to instruct him, or at least to entertain him in
that particular also. But for the present, lest such an
unconcerning trifle be forgotten, I desire him to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he hath little reason to concern himself in the
just number of seven Sacraments; for that there are
brought in amongst them some new devices, I cannot
call them Sacraments, but something like what they
have already forg'd, which being but external rites, yet
out-do most of their Sacraments. About the year 1630.
there were introduc'd into <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Franciscans</hi>
and <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friers three pretty propositions. 1. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall die in the habit of S. <hi>Francis</hi> shall never be
prevented with an unhappy death. 2. Whosoever
shall take the <hi>Scapular</hi> of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and die in the


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64671:105"/>
same, shall never be damned. 3. Whosoever shall fast
the first Saturday after they have heard of the death of
<hi>Luissa,</hi> a Spanish Nun of the Order of S. <hi>Clare,</hi> shall
have no part in the second death. Now these external
rites promise more grace than is conferr'd by their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
for it promises a certainty of glory, and
an intermediat certainty of being in the state of Grace;
which to them is not and cannot be done (according
to their doctrine) by all the other Sacraments and
Sacramentals of their Church. Now these things are
deriv'd to them by pretended revelations of S. <hi>Francis,</hi>
and S. <hi>Simon Stoc.</hi> And though I know not what the
Priests and Friers in <hi>England</hi> will think or say of this
matter, yet I assure them, in <hi>Ireland</hi> they are of great
account, and with much fancy, religion and veneration
us'd at this day. And not long since visiting some of my
Churches I found an old Nun in the Neighbourhood,
a poor <hi>Clare</hi> (as I think;) but missing her Cord about
her, which I had formerly observ'd her to wear, I ask'd
the cause, and was freely answered, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
who had lately died had purchas'd it of her,
to put about her in her grave. And of how great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
the Saturday-fast is here, every one knows,
but the cause I knew not, till I had learn'd the story of
S. <hi>Luissa;</hi> and that <hi>Flemming,</hi> their Archbishop of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> had given countenance to it by his example
and credulity. But now it may be perceiv'd that the
question of seven Sacraments is out-done by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of some new ones, which although they want
the name, do greater effects, and therefore have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
title.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to more material considerations. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Perron</hi> hath chosen no other instances of matters
necessary (as he supposes them;) but there are many
ritual matters, customs, and ceremonies which were (at
least it is said so) practis'd by the Apostolical Churches;


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64671:106"/>
and some it may be are descended down to us: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Churches practise many things which the
Apostles did not; and the Apostles did and ordain'd
many things, which the Church does not observe; it
will not appertain to the Question, to say, There are,
or are not, in these things <hi>Traditions Apostolical.</hi> The

in the time of their meal from the hand of the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
of Religion; <hi>anniversary oblations on birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
and for the dead; not to fast, not to kneel on
Sundays; perpetual festivities from Easter to Whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide;
not to endure, without great trouble, bread or drink
to fall upon the ground; and at every motion, to sign
the forehead, with the sign of the Cross.</hi> Some of these


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64671:106"/>
are rituals, and some are still observed, and some are
superstitious and observ'd by no body; and some that
are not, may be if the Church please: these indeed
were traditions, or customes before his time; but not
so much as pretended to be Apostolical; but if they
were, are yet of the same consideration with the rest.
If they be customs of the Church, they are not, without
great reason and just authority, to be laid aside: <hi>But
are of no other argument against Scripture, than if all
the particular customs of all Churches were urg'd.</hi> For,
if they had come from the Apostles (as these did not,)
yet if the Apostles say, <hi>dicit Dominus,</hi> they must be
obeyed for ever; but if the word be, <hi>dico ego, non
Dominus,</hi> the Church hath her liberty to do what in
the changing times is most for edification. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in these things, let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend
what traditions Apostolical she please of this nature,
the Church may keep them, or lay them aside, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what they judge is best. For if those Canons
and traditions of the Apostles, of which there is no
question, and which are recorded in Scripture, yet are
worn out, and laid aside; those certainly which are
pretended to be such, and cannot be proved, cannot
pass into perpetual obligation, whether the Churches
will or no.</p>
                  <p>I shall not need upon this head, to consider any more
instances; because all the points of Popery are pretended
to rely upon Tradition. The novelty of which, because
I shall demonstrate in their proper places, proving
them to be so far from being traditions Apostolical, that
they are mere Innovations in Religion: I shall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the uncertainty and fallibility of the pretence
of Traditions in ordinary; and the certain deceptions of
those who trust them, &amp; the impossibility of ending ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
questions by them. I shall not bring the usual argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are brought from Scriptures against tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64671:107"/>
because although those which Christ condemns
in the Pharisees, and the Apostles in Heretical persons,
are not reprov'd for being Traditions, but for being
without Divine authority; that is, they are either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Commandment of God, or without any
warrant from God: yet if there be any traditions, real
and true; that is, words of God not written, they (if
they could be shown) would be very good. But then
I desire the same ingenuity on the other side; and that
the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers would not trouble the Question,
or abuse their Readers, by bringing Scriptures to prove
their traditions: not by shewing they are recorded in
Scripture;<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.</note> but by bringing Scriptures where the word
<hi>tradition</hi> is nam'd.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> For besides that such places can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be with any modesty pretended, as proofs of the
particular traditions; it is also certain, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove that in General there are, or can be, any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recorded
Scripture, when the whole Canon should be
written, consign'd, and entertain'd. For it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that traditions should be call'd on to be kept
before Scriptures were written, and yet afterwards
not necessary; and those things which were deliver'd
and are not in Scripture, may be lost, because they
were not written; and then that may be impossible
for us to do, which at first might have been done. But
this being laid aside, I proceed to Considerations
proper to the Question.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Great Patrons of Tradition; and they have
given rules by which we shall know Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and it is well they do so; for sand ought to be
put into a glass, and water into a vessel; something
to limit the running element, that when you have
receiv'd it, you may keep it. A nuncupative record
is like figures in the air, or diagrams in sand; the air
and the wind will soon disorder the lines. And God


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64671:107"/>
knowing this, and all things else, would not trust so
much as the Ten words of <hi>Moses</hi> to oral tradition, but
twice wrote them in Tables of Stone with his own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.<note place="margin">Clem. Alexan. Strom. lib. 1. pag. 276.</note>
                     <hi>[I know</hi> (said S. <hi>Clement) that many things are
lost by length of time, for want of writing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I of necessity make use of memorials, and collection of
Chapters, to supply the weakness of my memory.]</hi> And
when S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in his journey towards Martyrdom,
confirm'd the Churches through which he passed, by
private exhortations, as well as he was permitted; he
exhorted them all, to adhere to the tradition of the
Apostles, (meaning that doctrine which was preach'd
by them in their Churches) and added this advice, or
caution,<note place="margin">Eusib lib. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>That he esteem'd it was necessary, that this
Tradition should be committed to writing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. hist. c. 35. Graec.</note> that it might
be preserv'd to posterity: and Reports by word of

                     <hi>Linus,</hi> or <hi>Anacletus;</hi> and the
subscriptions of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, having no record but
the Uncertain voice of Tradition, are in some things
evidently mistaken, and in some others, very uncertain.
And upon the same account, we cannot tell how many
Bishops were conven'd at <hi>Nice: Eusebius</hi> says they were
250. S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> says, they were just 300. <hi>Eustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

pretences have been, and are daily made of Traditions
Apostolical, which yet are not so, a wise man will take
heed, lest his credulity and good nature, make him to
become a fool. S. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> says, that the
Apostles preach'd to dead Infidels, and then rais'd
them to life: and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were justified by
their Philosophy; and accounts these among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Traditions.<note place="margin">Epist. ad Episc. Antioch.</note> Pope <hi>Marcellus</hi> was bold to say,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64671:108"/>
that it was an Apostolical Tradition or Canon, that a
Council could not be called but by the authority of the
Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> but the Churches in the first ages pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
otherwise, and the Greeks never believ'd it;
nor are all the Latin Churches of that opinion, as shall
be shown in the sequel: The second Canon of the
Council in <hi>Trullo,</hi> commands observation of no less
than fourscore and five Canons Apostolical deliver'd to
the Church; but, besides that no Church keeps them,
there are not many who believe that they came from
the Apostles. S. <hi>Austin</hi> said that the Communicating
of Infants was an Apostolical Tradition; but neither
the Protestants, nor the Papists, believe him in that
particular.<note place="margin">Stromat. lib. 1. lib. 2. c. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> said, that Christ

vehemently, and said it was an Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That Christ was about 50 years of age when he died,

                     <hi>Origen</hi> says, <hi>No man ought for the

<hi>to use books which are not
Canoniz'd Scriptures.</hi> Now, for
ought appears to the contrary, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Traditions were two or three
hundred years old the first day
they were born; and it is not easie
to reckon by what means the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
came, or might come, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
many things to be Tradition;
and themselves were not sure:
therefore they made rules of their
conjecture, presumptions, and sometimes weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
It will be much more hard <hi>for us</hi> to tell which
are right and which are wrong; who have nothing but
<hi>their rules,</hi> which were then but conjectural, and are
since prov'd in many instances to be improbable.</p>
                  <p>1. Such is that rule of S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 4. de baptis. contr. Donat. c. 24. &amp;c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatsoever was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
receiv'd, and not instituted (so far as men look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back may observe) by posterity,</hi> that is, <hi>not decreed
by Councils, may most rightly be believ'd to descend
from Apostolical Tradition:</hi> That is, if we do not know
the beginning of an universal custom, we may safely


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64671:109"/>
conclude it to be Primitive, and Apostolick. Which
kind of rule is something like what a witty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
said of an old man and an old woman in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
that if they should agree to say that they were <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> no man living could disprove them. But
though these persons are so old that no man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
their beginning, and though a custom be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial,
and hath prevail'd far and long; yet to reduce
this to the beginning of things may be presum'd by him
that a mind to it, but can never convince him that
hath not. And it is certain, this rule is but a precarious
pitiful Presumption, since every ancient custom that
any succeeding age hath a mind to continue, may, for
the credit of it, and the ignorance of the original, like
new upstart Gentlemen, be entituled to an Honourable
House. <hi>Every one believes the Commandments of his
Ancestors to be Traditions Apostolical,</hi> said S. <hi>Hierom:</hi>
And that these came in by private authority, and yet
obtain'd a publick name, we have competent warranty
from <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Coronâ Milit. c. 4.</note> who justifies it thus far. <hi>[Do you not
think it lawful for every faithful man to appoint what
ever he thinks may please God, unto discipline and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi>
And <hi>[From whomsoever the Tradition comes,
regard not the Author, but the Authority.]</hi> And S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
tells,<note place="margin">Apud Euseb. l. 5. c. 26. Gr. 24. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t.</note> that the variety of keeping Lent (which
puts in strongly also to be an Apostolical Tradition) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
among his Ancestors <hi>[who did not accurately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their customs, who by a certain simplicity or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
authority appointed any thing for their posterity.]</hi>
So that here it is apparent that every private man that
was of an ancient standing in the Church, might intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
customs and usages which himself thought pious.
And next, it is also evident, that when these customs
deriv'd from their Ancestors, hapned to continue in a
lasting use, their posterity was very apt to call them
Traditions Apostolical: according to<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Coronâ Militis. Si legem nusquam repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, sequitur ut Traditio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudini morem hunc dederit, habitu um quandóque Apostoli autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatione rationis.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64671:109"/>
confessed this very thing. Thus things indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
esteem'd useful or pious, became customary, and
then came for reverence into a putative and usurp'd
authority: But they who, having this warning from
the very persons whence the mistake comes, will yet
swallow the hook, deserve to live upon air and fancy,
and to chew deceit.</p>
                  <p>But this Topick of pretended Tradition is the most
fallible thing in the world; for it is discover'd, of some
things that are called Apostolical tradition, that they
had their original of being so esteemed upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and reputation of one man. Some I say have
been so discover'd. <hi>Papias</hi> was the Author of the Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
opinion, which prevailed for about three whole
ages; and that so Universally, that <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> said
it was believ'd by all that were perfectly Orthodox;
and yet it recurres to him onely as the fountain of the
Tradition. But of this I shall say no more, because
this instance hath been by others examin'd and clear'd.
The assumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is esteem'd a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
Apostolical, but it can derive no higher then
S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In serm. de Assumptione.</note> whose doctrine alone brought into the
Church the veneration of the Assumption; which
S. <hi>Hierom</hi> yet durst not be confident of. But the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of keeping <hi>Easter</hi> the fourteen day of the Moon,
deriv'd onely from S. <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Salmeron tract. 51. in Rom. 5. p. 468 in marg.</note> and the <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the other from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> prevail'd, though
it had no greater authority. But the Communicating of
Infants prevail'd for many ages in the West,<note place="margin">S. Hierom. dial. adv. Lucifer.</note> and to this
day in the East, and went for an Apostolical Tradition;
but the fortune of it is chang'd, and it now passes for
an errour: and S. <hi>Hierom</hi> said, It was an Apostolical
Tradition, that a Priest should never baptize without
Chrism; but of this we have scarce any testimony but
his own.</p>
                  <p>But besides this, there was in the beginning of


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64671:110"/>
Christianity, some Apocryphal books: of these, <hi>Origen</hi>
gave great caution;<note place="margin">Tract. 26. in Matth.</note> and because the falsity of these, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
good man could not discover, therefore he charges
them, that they should offer to prove no Opinion from
any books, but from the Canonical Scriptures, as I
have already quoted him; but these were very busie
in reporting traditions. The book of <hi>Hermes</hi> seduc'd
S. <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> into a belief, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
preach'd to them that died Infidels, and then
rais'd them to life: and the Apocryphal books under
the title of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> make him believe that the
<hi>Greeks</hi> were sav'd by their Philosophy: and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (so far as yet appears) was author
of the pretended tradition of the signing with the Sign
of the Cross, at every motion of the body; and led
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> and S. <hi>Basil,</hi> and, in consequence, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of succeeding ages, into the practise of it. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thing will draw on a willing mind; and nothing is
so credulous, as piety and timerous Religion; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was more fearful to displease God, and curious
to please him than the <hi>Primitive Christians;</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that would invite them to what they thought
pious was sure to prevail; and how many such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
might enter in at this wide door, every man can
easily observe.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, that the world is not agreed about the
competency of the testimony; or what is sufficient to
prove tradition to be Apostolical. Some require and
allow only the testimony of the present Catholick
Church, to prove a Tradition: which way if it were
sufficient, then it is certain, that many things which the
primitive Fathers and Churches esteem'd tradition,
would be found not to be such; because (as appears
in divers instances above reckon'd) they admitted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> traditions which the present Church rejects. 2. If
this were the way, then truth were as variable as time;


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64671:110"/>
and there could be no degrees of credibility in testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but still the present were to carry it; that is, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
age were to believe themselves, and no body else.
And the reason of these things is this, because some
things have in some ages been universally receiv'd, in
others universally rejected. I instance in the state of
Saints departed, which once was the opinion of some
whole ages; and now we know in what ages it is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an error. 3. The Communicating Infants, before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
in, was the practise of the Church for 600 years
together.<note place="margin">Maldonat. in 6. Joh. 53. vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etiam Espén<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> de ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Eucharist. l. 2. c. 12.</note> Now all that while, there was no Apostolical
tradition against this doctrine and practice, or at least
none known: for, if there had, these Ages would not
have admitted this doctrine: But if there were no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
against it at that time, there is none now. And
indeed the Testimony of the present Church cannot be
useful in the Question of Tradition, if ever there was
any age or number of orthodox and learned men, that
were against it: only in a negative way it can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
that is, if there was no doctrine, or practice,
or report ever to the contrary, then they that have a
mind to it, may suppose, or hope, it was Apostolical;
or at least, they cannot be sure that it was not. But this
way can never be useful in the Questions of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
because in them there is Father against Son, and
Son against Father; <hi>Greeks</hi> against <hi>Latin:</hi> and their
minds differ as far, as East and West; and therefore it
cannot be in our late Questions, that there was never
any thing said to the contrary; but if there was, then
the testimony of the present Church is not sufficient to
prove the tradition to be Catholick and Apostolick.
4. If the testimony of the present Church were a sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
record of Tradition Apostolical, then it is because the
present Church is infallible; but for that, there is neither
Scripture, nor Tradition: or, if there were for its infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
in matter of faith, yet there is none for its infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64671:111"/>
in matter of fact; and such is the Tradition:
concerning which the Question only is, Whether such
a thing was actually taught by an Apostle, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
down by the hand of uninterrupted succession
of Sees and Churches. <hi>Antiquissimum quodque, verissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
We know the fountains were pure; and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
by how much the nearer it is to the spring, it is the
less likely to be corrupted. And therefore it is a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the wrong end, to say, The present Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
this, therefore so did the primitive: but let it be
shewed that the primitive did believe this; for else it
is Out-facing of an Opponent; as if he ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asham'd
to question whether you have done well, or
no. For, if that question may be ask'd, it must be
submitted to trial, and it must be answer'd; and the
holding the opinion, will not justifie the holding it;
that must be done by something else: therefore the
sampler and the sampled must be compar'd together;
and it will be an ill excuse, if a servant, who delivers a
spotted garment to his Lord, and tells him, <hi>Thus it was
deliver'd to me, for thus you see it is now.</hi> If he can
prove it was so at first, he may be justified, but else at
no hand. And I and all the world will be strangely
to seek what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> means, by making
conformity to the Primitive Church, a note of the
true Church; if [being now as it is] be the rule for
what it ought to be: For if so, then well may we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the primitive Church by the present, but not the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> present by the primitive.<note place="margin">5.</note> 5. If the present Catholick
Church were infallible, yet we were not much the
nearer, unless this Catholick Church could be consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, and heard to speak; not then neither, unless
we know which were indeed the Catholick Church.
There is no word in Scripture, that the testimony of
the present Church, is the infallible way of proving
the unwritten word of God; and there is no tradition.


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64671:111"/>
that it is so, that I ever yet heard of; and it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it should be so, because the present Church of
several ages have had contrary traditions: And if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be, why shall we believe it? if there be, let it be
shewed. In the mean time, it is something strange,
that the infallibility of a Church, should be brought
to prove every particular tradition; and yet it self be
one of those particular traditions which proves it self.</p>
                  <p>But there is a better way: <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> his
way, of judging a traditional doctrine to be Apostolical
and Divine, is, The <hi>consent of all Churches, and all Ages.</hi>
It is something less that S. <hi>Austin</hi> requires,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de doct. Christiana. c. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Ecclesiarum
Catholicarum quamplurimùm sequatur (authoritatem,)
inter quas sane illae sunt quae Apostolicas sedes habere,
&amp; Epistolas accipere meruerunt.</hi> 
                     <q>He speaks it of the
particular of judging what Books are Canonical; In
which, as tradition is the way to judge, so the rule
of tradition is the consent of most of the Catholick
Churches; particularly, those places where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did sit, and to which the Apostles did write.</q>
But this fancy of S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s, is to be understood so, as
not to be measur'd by the practise, but by the doctrine
of the Apostolical Churches. For that any, or more
of these Churches did, or did not do so, is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that such a Custom came from the Apostles; or
if it did, that it did oblige succeeding ages: unless
this Custom began by a doctrine, and that the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
came from the Apostles, with a declaration of it's
perpetual obligation. And therefore this is only of
use in matters of necessary doctrine. But because
there is in this question, many differing degrees of
authority; he says that our assent is to be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
<q>Those which are receiv'd of all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Churches are to be preferr'd, before those
which are not receiv'd by all; and of these, those are
to be preferr'd, which have the more and the graver


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64671:112"/>
testimony: but if it should happen (which yet is not)
that some are witnessed by the more, and others by
the graver, let the assent be equal.]</q> This indeed,
is a good way to know nothing; for if one Apostolical
Church differ from another in a doctrinal tradition,
no man can tell whom to follow, for they are of
equal authority; and nothing can be thence proved,
but that Oral tradition is an uncertain way of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Doctrine. But yet this way of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> is of
great and approved use, in the knowing what Books are
Canonical; and in these things it can be had, in
some more, in some less, in all more than can be said
against it: and there is nothing in succeeding times, to
give a check to our assents in their degrees, because
the longer the Succession runs, still the more the
Church was established in it. But yet concerning those
Books of Scripture, of which it was long doubted in
the Church, whether they were part of the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Canon of Scripture; there ought to be no pretence,
that they were deliver'd for such by the Apostles, at
least not by those Churches, who doubted of them:
unless they will confess, that either their Churches were
not founded by an Apostle; or that the Apostle, who
founded them, was not faithful in his Office, in transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all that was necessary; or else that those Books
(particularly, the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> &amp;c.) were no
necessary part of the Canon of Scripture; or else, lastly,
that that Church was no faithful keeper of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which came from the Apostle. All which things,
because they will be deny'd by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
concerning themselves; the consequent will be, that
Tradition is an Uncertain thing; &amp;, if it cannot be intire
and full in assigning the Canon of Scripture, it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be trusted for any thing else which consists of
words subject to divers interpretations. But in other
things (it may be) the case is not so: For we find that


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64671:112"/>
in divers particulars, to prove a point to be a Tradition
Apostolical, use is made of the testimony of the three
first Ages. Indeed, these are the likest to know; but
yet they have told us of some things to be Traditions,
which we have no reason to believe to be such. Onely
thus far they are useful; If they never reported a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
it is the less likely to descend from the Apostles;
and if the order of succession be broken any where, the
succeeding ages can never be surer. If they speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a doctrine, as for example, against the half-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
we are sure, it was no Tradition Apostolical;
if they speak not at all of it, we can never prove the
Tradition; for it may have come in since that time, and
yet come to be thought or call'd <hi>Tradition Apostolical</hi>
from other causes, of which I have given account. And
indeed there is no security sufficient, but that which
can never be had; and that is, the Universal <hi>positive</hi>
testimony of all the Church of Christ; which he that
looks for in the disputed Traditions, pretended by
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may look as long as the Jews
do for their wrong <hi>Messias.</hi> So much as this is, can
never be had; and less than this, will never do it.
I will give one considerable instance of this affair:
<q>The Patrons of the opinion of the immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Blessed Virgin-mother,<note place="margin">Salmeron. disp. 51. in Rom. 5.</note> allege, that
they have the consent of almost the Universal
Church, and the agreeing sentence of all Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
especially of the chief, that is, of <hi>Paris;</hi> where
no man is admitted to be Master in Theology, unless
he binds himself by oath to maintain that doctrine.
They allege, that since this question began to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
almost all the Masters in Theology, all the
Preachers of the Word of God, all Kings and Princes,
republiques and peoples, all Popes and Pastors, and
Religions (except a part of one) consent in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
They say, that of those Authors which are


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64671:113"/>
by the other side pretended against it, some are fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cited, others are wrested and brought in against
their wills; some are scarce worth the remembring,
and are of an obsolete and worn-out authority.]</q>
Now if these men say true, then they prove a tradition,
or else nothing will prove it but a consent absolutely
Universal, which is not to be had. For, on the other
side, <q>They that speak against the immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Blessed Virgin, particularly Cardinal
<hi>Cajetan,</hi> bring (as he says) the irrefragable testimony
of fifteen Fathers against it: others bring no less
then two hundred; and <hi>Bandellus</hi> brings in almost
three hundred:]</q> and that will go a great way to
prove a Tradition. But that this also is not sufficient,
see what the other side say to this. <q>They say [that
<hi>Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Holcot,</hi> and <hi>Vbertinusde Casalis,</hi> and the
old Definition of the University of <hi>Paris,</hi> and S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> are brought in falsely or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently;
and if they were not, yet they say it is an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literal
disputation, and not far from Sophistry, to
proceed in this way of arguing: For it happens
sometimes that a multitude of Opiners proceeds
onely from one famous Doctor; and that when the
<hi>Donatists</hi> did glory in the multitude of Authors,
S. <hi>Austin</hi> answer'd, that it was a sign the cause
wanted truth, when it endeavour'd to relie alone
upon the authority of many: and that it was not
fit to relate the sentiment of S. <hi>Bernard, Bonaventure,
Thomas,</hi> and other Devotes of the Blessed Virgin,
as if they were most likely to know her priviledges,
and therefore would not have denied this of Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
Conception, if it had been her due. For she
hath many devout servants the world knows not of:
and <hi>Elisha,</hi> though he had the spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> doubled
upon him, yet said, <hi>Dominus celavit à me, &amp; non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit
mihi;</hi> and when <hi>Elias</hi> complain'd he was left


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64671:113"/>
alone, God said he had 7000 more. And the Apostles
did not know all things; and S. <hi>Peter</hi> walk'd not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the truth of the Gospel; and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
err'd in the point of rebaptizing hereticks. For God
hath not given all things unto all persons, that every
age may have proper truths of its own, which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
age knew not.]</q> Thus <hi>Salmeron</hi> discourses, and
this is the way of many others, more eminent; who
make use of authority and antiquity when it serves
their turn; and when it does not, it is of no use, and of
no value.</p>
                  <p>But if these things be thus, then how shall Tradition
be prov'd? if the little remnant of the Dominican par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which are against the Immaculate Conception,
should chance to be brought off from their opinion
(as, if all the rest of the other Orders, and many of this
be already, it is no hard thing to conjecture, that the
rest may) and that the whole Church (as they will then
call it) be of one mind, shall it then be reasonable to
conclude, that then this doctrine was and is an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Tradition; when as yet we know and dare say, it
is not? That's the case, and that's the new doctrine:
but how impossible it is to be true, and how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there is in it, is now too apparent. I see that Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Saints is now at <hi>Rome</hi> accounted an Apostolical
doctrine: but with what confidence can any Jesuite
tell me that it is so, when by the Confession of their
chief parties it came in later than the fountains of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Doctrines.<note place="margin">De cultu S S. lib. 3. c. 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> Praetereà.</note> 
                     <hi>When the Scriptures were written, the
use of vowing to Saints was not begun,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine;</hi>
and Cardinal<note n="*" place="margin">Contre le Roy Jaques.</note> 
                     <hi>Perron</hi> confesses that in the Authors more
neer to the Apostolical age, no footsteps of this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
can be found. Where then is the Tradition Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical?
or can the affirmation of the present Church
make it so? To make a new thing, is easie; but no man
can make an old thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:64671:114"/>
The consequence of these things is this: All the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of faith and good life are contain'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in the plain places of Scripture; and besides it,
there are and there can be no Articles of faith: and
therefore they who introduce other articles, and upon
other principles, introduce a faith unknown to the
Apostles and the Fathers of the Primitive Church. And
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does this, I shall manifest in
the following discourses.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECTION IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">There is nothing of necessity to be believ'd, which the

                  <p>IN the first Part of the <hi>Dissuasive,</hi> it was said, that
the two Testaments are the Fountains of Faith;
and whatsoever <hi>(viz.</hi> as belonging to the faith)
came in after these, <hi>foris est,</hi> is to be cast out; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not to Christ: and now, I suppose, what was then
said is fully verified. And the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
many propositions upon the belief of the
Church, which are not in Scripture, and of which they
can never shew any Universal or Apostolical Tradition,
urging those upon pain of Damnation, imposing an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity of believing such points, which were
either denyed by the Primitive Church, or were count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but indifferent, and matters of opinion, hath disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Christian Religion, and made it to day a new
thing, and unlike the great and glorious Founder of it,
who is <hi>the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> The
charge here then is double, they have made new Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,

I chuse to speak first of their tyrannical Manner of
imposing their Articles; <hi>viz.</hi> every thing under pain
of damnation: The other of the new Matter, is the
subject of the following Sections.</p>
                  <p>First then, I alledge that the primitive Church being
taught by Scripture and the examples Apostolical, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
but few things to be necessary to salvation. They
believed the whole Scriptures; every thing they had
learn'd there, they equally believ'd: but because
every thing was not of equal necessity to be believ'd,
they did not equally learn and teach all that was in
Scripture. But the Apostles (say some,) othes say that
immediately after them the Church, did agree upon a
<hi>Creed,</hi> a Symbol of Articles which were in the whole,
the foundation of Faith, the ground of the Christian
hope; and that, upon which charity, or good life, was
to be built. There were in Scripture many Creeds; the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> Creed,<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 16.</note>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64671:115"/>
to it, we shall certainly be sav'd. If we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Christ to be our Lord, that is, our Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and our Saviour, to rescue us from our sins and
their just consequents, we have all faith; and nothing
else can be the foundation, but such Articles which are
the confession of those two truths, <hi>Christ Jesus our Lord,
Christ Jesus our Saviour;</hi> that by Faith we be brought
unto Obedience and Love; &amp; by this love we be brought
to Christ, and by Christ unto God; this is the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of the Christian faith, the Oeconomy of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
There are many other doctrines of Christianity
of admirable use, and fitted to great purposes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Government;<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 8.</note> but <hi>the word of faith</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
calls it) that which the Apostles preach'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to all,
and as of particular remark, and universal efficacy,
and absolute sufficiency to salvation, is that which is
describ'd by himself, in those few words now quoted.
<hi>Other foundation than this, no man can lay, that is,
Jesus Christ.</hi> Every thing else is but a superstructure;
and though it may, if it be good, be of advantage; yet if
it be amiss, so the foundation be kept, it will only be
matter of loss and detriment, but consistent with sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> judged, that he would
<hi>know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</hi> And
this is the summe total of all; <hi>This is the Gospel:</hi> so
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> most fully; <hi>I declare unto you the Gospel which
I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and
wherein ye stand, by which also ye are saved, if ye keep
in memory what I have preached unto you, unless ye have
believed in vain:</hi> And what is this Gospel, this word
<hi>preach'd and received,</hi> that <hi>by which we stand,</hi> and
<hi>that by which we are sav'd?</hi> It is nothing but this, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
unto you first of all that which I receiv'd, how
that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third
day, according to the Scriptures.</hi> This was the <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>


                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64671:115"/>
the <hi>depositum,</hi> this was the <hi>Evangelium;</hi> Christ died:
<hi>he died for our sins, and he rose again for us;</hi> and this
being the great Tradition, by which they tried the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
yet was it laid up in Scriptures.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11.</note> That <hi>Christ died,</hi>
was <hi>according to the Scriptures;</hi> that he rose again,
was <hi>according to the Scriptures;</hi> and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> twice,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 3. 4. 1 Cor. 2. 2.</note>
and that so immediately, remarks this, is not without
mystery; but it can imply to us nothing but this, that
our whole faith is laid up in the Scriptures; and this
faith is perfected, as to the essentiality of it, in the
Death and Resurrection of Christ; as being the whole
Oeconomy of our pardon, and Justification. And it is
yet further remarkable, that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> (as he often
does) renews and repeats this Christian Creed;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 6.</note> he calls
upon us,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> not to be wise above what is written; and to
be wise unto sobriety. Which he afterwards expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
says;<note place="margin">vers. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>He that prophesies, let him do it according to
the proportion of Faith;</hi> that is, if he will enlarge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
he may, and prophesie greatly; but still to keep
himself to the analogy of Faith; not to go beyond
that, not to be wiser than that measure of sobriety.
And if we observe the three Sermons of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the
Sermon of S. <hi>Philip,</hi> and S. <hi>Silas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 12.</note> the Sermons of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
often preached in the Synagogues; they were all but

Lord of all;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 8. 12. 37, 38.</note> that he is <hi>the Christ of God,</hi> that <hi>God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed

to be preach'd in his name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as the Spirit of God did purpose for ever with
strictness to retain the simplicity of Faith, so also he
was pleas'd so far to descant upon the plain ground, as
to make the mystery of godliness to be clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by all men. And therefore that we might see it
necessary to believe in Jesus, it was necessary we should
understand he was a person to be relied upon, that he


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64671:116"/>
was infinitely credible, powerful, and wise, just and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and that we might perceive it necessary and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to obey him, it was fit we understood Why; that
is, What good would follow him that is obedient, and
what evil to the refractory. This was all; and this
indeed was the necessary appendage of the simple and
pure word of Faith; and this the Apostles drew into a
Symbol, and particular minute of Articles. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the first was sufficient; yet they knowing it
was fit we should understand this simplicity, with the
investiture of some circumstances; and yet knowing,
that it was not fit, the simplicity of Faith, should be
troubled with new matter, were pleased to draw the
whole into a Scheme, sufficient and intelligible, but
nothing perplex'd, nothing impertinent: and this the
Church hath call'd the <hi>Apostles Creed;</hi> which contains
all that which is necessary to be inquir'd after, and
believ'd by an Universal and prime necessity.</p>
                  <p>True it is, other things may become necessary, by
accident, and collateral obligations; and if we come
to know what God in the abundance of his wisdom
and goodness, hath spoken to mankind, we are bound
to believe it: but the case is different. Many things
may be necessary to be believ'd, that we may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God's veracity: and so also many things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be done, in obedience to the empire and
dictates of the conscience; which oftentimes hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
when she hath no reason; and is a perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Judge, when she is no wise Counsellour. But
though these things are true; yet nothing is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Article of Faith, but that which ministers necessarily
to the great designs of the Gospel, that is, a life confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to God, a God-like life, and an imitation of
of the Holy Jesus. To <hi>believe,</hi> and to <hi>have faith</hi> in the
Evangelical sense, are things very different. Every
man is bound to have Faith in all the proper objects of


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64671:116"/>
it. But only some men are bound to believe truths,
which are not matters of Faith. This obliges upon
supposition of a manifest discovery, which may, or
may not happen; but in the other case, we are bound
to inquire; and all of us must be instructed, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
man must assent: and without this, we cannot be
Christ's Disciples; we are rebels, if we oppose the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and no good man can or does.</p>
                  <p>For if he be satisfied, that it is the word and mind
of God, he must and will believe it, he cannot
chuse; and if he will not confess it, when he thinks
God bids him, or if he opposes it when he thinks
God speaks it, he is malicious and a villain; but if
he does not believe God said it, then he must answer
for more than he knows, or than he ought to believe,
that is, the Articles of Faith: but we are not Subjects
or Children, unless we consent to these. The other
cannot come into the common accounts of mankind,
but as a man may become a law unto himself, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
an unnecessary, and even a false perswasion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
even an erring conscience, can bind) so much
more can God become a law unto us, when we by
any accident, come into the knowledge of any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
from God: but these are not the Christian Faith
(in the strict and proper sense;) that is, these are not
the foundation of our Religion: many a man is a good
Christian <hi>without them;</hi> and goes to Heaven, though he
know nothing of them; but <hi>without these,</hi> no Christian
can be sav'd.</p>
                  <p>Now then, the Apostles, the founders of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
knowing the nature, design, efficacy and purpose of
the Articles of Faith, selected such propositions, which
in conjunction did integrate our Faith, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
necessary to be believ'd unto salvation; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these Articles were for themselves commanded
to be believ'd; but because, without the belief of them,


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64671:117"/>
we could not obtain the purposes and designs of faith;
that is, we could not be enabled to serve God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the whole body of sin, to be partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature. This Collect or Symbol of propositions is
that which we call the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> which I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prove to have been always in the Primitive
Church esteemed a full and perfect Digest of all the
necessary and fundamental Articles of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and that beyond this, the Christian faith or the
foundation was not to be extended; but this, as it
was in the whole Complexion necessary, so it was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for all men unto Salvation.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave us the first formal intimation of this
measure,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13.</note> in his advises to S. <hi>Timothy: Hold fast the
form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in
faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus. That good thing
which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost,
which dwelleth in us.]</hi> This was the <hi>depositum</hi> that
S. <hi>Paul</hi> left with <hi>Timothy;</hi> the <hi>hypotyposis</hi> or summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christian Belief, the Christian Creed; which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> opposes to the <hi>prophane new talkings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 20.</note> and the
<hi>disputations</hi> of pretended learning: meaning, that this
Symbol of faith is the thing on which all Christians
are to relie; and this is the measure of their faith;
other things, it is ods, but they are bablings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
quarrelling, and unedifying argumentations.
S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> recites the substance of this Creed in four

faith which the Catholick Church to the very ends of
the Earth hath received from the Apostles and their


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64671:117"/>
disciples.</hi> And this is that Tradition Apostolical of
which the Churches of old did so much glory, and to
which with so much confidence they appealed, and by
which they provoked the hereticks to trial.<note place="margin">Et. cap. 3.</note> 
                     <q>[This
Preaching and this Faith when the Church scattered
over the face of the world had receiv'd, she keeps
diligently as dwelling in one house; and believes, as
having one soul and one heart; and preaches and
teaches, and delivers these things, as possessing one
mouth. For although there are divers speeches in
the world, yet the force of the Tradition is one and
the same. Neither do the Churches founded in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>

<hi>[neither he who is most eloquent among the Bishops can
say any other things than these: for no man is above his
Master: neither hath he that is the lowest in speaking
lessened the tradition. For the faith is one and the same;
he that can speak much, can speak no more; and he that
speaks little, says no less.]</hi> This Creed also he recites
again, affirming that even those Nations, who had not
yet received the books of the Apostles and Evangelists,
yet by this Confession and this Creed,<note place="margin">Lib 3 cap. 4. Propter fidem per quam sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entissimi sunt.</note> did <hi>please God,
and were most wise through faith:</hi> for this is that which
he calls, the <hi>tradition of the truth;</hi> that is, of that
truth which the Apostles taught the Church; and by
the actual retention of which truth, it is, that the
Church is rightly called, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi>
by S. <hi>Paul;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 62.</note> and in relation to this, S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> reckon'd
it to be all one; <hi>extra veritatem, id est, extra Ecclesiam.</hi>

they oppos'd all schisms and heresies; as knowing

the Law and the Prophets, with the Evangelical,

to Martyrdom, and against this Institution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
none.]</q> This indeed was a happy state; and
if in this she would abide, her happiness had been as
unalterable, as her faith. But from this, how much
she hath degenerated, will too much appear, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of this discourse.</p>
                  <p>In the confession of this Creed, the Church of God
baptiz'd all her Catechumens; to whom in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of that faith, they consign'd all the promises of
the Gospel.<note place="margin">S. Hilar. l. 10. de Trinit. vers. finem.</note> For the truth of God, the faith of Jesus
Christ, the belief of a Christian is the purest, simplest
thing in the world. <hi>In simplicitate fides est, in fide
justitia est, in confessione pietas est: Nec Deus nos ad
beatam vitam per difficiles quaestiones vocat, nec multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici
eloquentis facundiae genere sollicitat; in absoluto
nobis ac facili est aeternitas. Jesum Christum credimus

confitemur.</hi> This is the Breviary of the Christian Creed:
and this is the way of salvation,<note place="margin">lib. de Synodis.</note> saith S. <hi>Hilary.</hi> But
speaking more explicitely to the Churches of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Germany;</hi> he calls them happy and glorious,
<hi>qui perfectam atque Apostolicam fidem conscientiâ &amp;
professione Dei retinentes, conscriptas fides hûc usque
nescitis;</hi> because they kept the Apostolical Belief:
for, that is perfect.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Church remaining in the purity, and innocent
simplicity of the Faith; there was no way of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Hereticks, but by the words of Scripture, or by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64671:119"/>
to the tradition of this Faith, in the Apostolical
form: and there was no change made till the time of
the <hi>Nicene Council;</hi> but then, it is said, that the first
simplicity began to fall away, and some new thing to
be introduc'd into the Christian Creed. True it is,
that then Christianity was in one complexion with the
Empire; and the division of Hearts, by a different
Opinion, was likely to have influence upon the publick
peace, if it were not compos'd by peaceable consent, or
prevailing authority; and therefore the Fathers there as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
together with the Emperour's power, did give
such a period to their Question as they could; but as
yet it is not certain, that they at their meeting reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any other Creed than the Apostolical; for that they
did not,<note place="margin">In Antidoto ad Nicolaum 5. Papam.</note> 
                     <hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> a Canon in the <hi>Lateran</hi>
Church, affirms, that himself hath read in the ancient
Books of <hi>Isidore,</hi> who collected the Canons of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Councils. Certain it is, the Fathers believ'd it to
be no other than the Apostolical faith; and the few
words they added to the old form, was nothing new,
but a few more explicate words, of the same sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Apostles, and their Successors; as at that
time the Church did remember by the successive prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings,
and written Records which they had, and we
have not; but especially by Scripture. But the change
was so little, or indeed so none as to the matter, that
they affirmed of it;<note place="margin">Epiphan. in. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>This was the Creed deliver'd by the
Holy Apostles;</hi> and in the old Latin Missal, published
at <hi>Strasburgh, An. Dom. 1557.</hi> after the recitation of
the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed (as we usually call it) it is added in
the Rubrick; <hi>Finito Symbolo Apostolorum dicat Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,
Dominus vobiscum.</hi> So that it should seem, the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers us'd no other Creed, than what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thought to be the Apostolical. And this is the
more credible, because we find that some other Copies of
the Apostles Creed; particularly, that which was us'd


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64671:119"/>
in the Church of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> hath divers words and
amplifications of some one Article; as, to the Article
of, God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven
and Earth, is added <hi>invisible</hi> and <hi>impassible:</hi> which,
though the words were set down there, because of
the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heresie; yet they said nothing new, but
what to every man of reason was included in the very
nature of God; and so was the addition of <hi>Nice,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Divinity of the Son of God, included in
the very natural Filiation expressed in the Apostles
Creed: and therefore this <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, was no more
a new Creed, than was that of <hi>Aquileia;</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was not in every word, like the <hi>Roman</hi> Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol,
yet it was no other, than the Apostolical. And
the same is the case even of those Symbols, where
something was omitted, that was sufficiently in the
bowels of the other Articles; Thus in some Creeds,
<hi>Christ's Death</hi> is omitted; but his <hi>Crucifixion</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
are set down. The same variety also is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Article of Christ's descent into Hell; which
as it is omitted in that form of the Apostolical Creed,
which I am now saying was us'd by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers;
so was it omitted in the six several Recitations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of it, made by <hi>Chrysologus,</hi> and in the five Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
made of it by S. <hi>Austin,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Fide
&amp; Symbolo,</hi> and in his four Books, <hi>de Symbolo ad Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumenos,</hi>
and divers others. So the Article of the
Communion of Saints, which is neither in the <hi>Nicene,</hi>
nor <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Creed, nor in the ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Creeds, expounded by <hi>Marcellus, Ruffinus, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sologus,
Maximus Taurinensis, Venantius Fortunatus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi>
and <hi>Beatus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 1. contra. Elipand. Tolet.</note> yet because it is so plain in the Article
of the Church; as, the omission is no prejudice to the
integrity of the Christian Faith, so the inserting it is no
addition of an Article, or Innovation. So these Copies
now reckon'd, omit in the beginning of the Creed,


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64671:120"/>
                     <hi>Maker of Heaven and Earth;</hi> but out of the <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan</hi>
Creed, it is now inserted into all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the Apostolical Symbol. Now, as these omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
or additions respectively, that is, this variety is
no prejudice to these being the Apostles Creed; So
neither is the addition made at <hi>Nice,</hi> any other, but a
setting down what was plainly included in the Filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Son of God; and therefore was no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Article, nor properly an explication, but a
saying in more words what the Apostles, and the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Churches did mean in all the Copies, and what was
deliver'd before that Convention at <hi>Nice.</hi> But there was
ill use made of it; and wise men, if they had pleased,
might easily have foreseen it. But whether it was so,
or no (for I can no otherwise affirm it, than as I have
said) yet to add any new thing to the Creed, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a new Creed, was at that time so strange a thing,
so unknown to the Church, that though what they did,
was done with pious intention, and great advantage
in the Article it self; yet it did not produce that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
which from such a concurrence of sentiments,
might have been expected. For first, even some of
the Fathers then present, refus'd to subscribe the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
some did it (as they said) against their will, some
were afraid to use the word <gap reason="foreign">

and most men were still so unsatisfied, that presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

rule of faith and conscience; which if they had done
they might easily have been oppress'd by their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
urging the plain authority of the Council against
them. But, <hi>Neither am I to urge against thee the Nicene
Council, nor thou the Council of Ariminum against me,</hi>
was the saying of S. <hi>Austin;</hi> even long after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice</hi> had by Concession obtain'd more authority
than it had at first. Now the reason of these things can
be no other than this; not that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council
was not the best that ever was since the day that a
Council was held at Jerusalem by all the Apostles;
but that the Council's adding something to the Creed
of the Church, which had been the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith for 300 years together, was so strange a
thing, that they would not easily bear that yoke. And


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64671:121"/>
that this was the matter, appears by what the Fathers
of the Church after the Council did complain.<note place="margin">Dum in verbis pugna est, dum de novitatibus quaestio est, dum de ambiguis, dum de Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus querelae est; dum de studiis certamen est, dum in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu difficultas est, dum<expan>

                     <hi>[After
the Nicene Synod we write nothing but Faiths,</hi> viz. (new
Creeds:) <hi>while there is contention about Words, while
there is question about Novelties, while there is complaint
of ambiguities, and of Authors, while there is contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of parties, and difficulty in consenting, and while one
is become an Anathema to another, scarce any man now is
of Christ.]</hi> And again, <hi>[We decree yearly and monethly
faiths of God; we repent when we have decreed them;
we defend them that repent, we anathematize them that

the product of leaving the simplicity and perfection of

their religious lives, and their holy baptism

                  <p>And yet the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers did adde no new Article,<note place="margin">Quid unquam aliud Ecclesia Conciliorum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretis enisa est, nisi ut, quod an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea simpliciter credebatur, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of new matter; but explicated the Filiation of Jesus
Christ, saying in what sense he was the Son of God;
which was in proper speaking an interpretation of a
word in the Apostles Creed: and yet this occasion'd
such stirs, and gave so little satisfaction at first, and so
great disturbances afterward; that S. <hi>Hilary</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodis.</note> call'd
them happy, who neither made, nor knew, nor receiv'd

in all Churches ever since the Apostles days.</p>
                  <p>However, it pleas'd the Divine Providence so to
conduct the spirits of the Catholick Prelates, that by
their wise and holy adhering to the Creed as explicated
at <hi>Nice,</hi> they procur'd great authority to the <hi>Nicene</hi>
faith, which was not onely the truth, but a truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
and confirm'd by the most famous and excellent


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64671:121"/>
Prelates that ever the Christian Church could glory in,
since the death of the Apostles. But yet that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
might be cut off which came in upon the
occasion of the <hi>Nicene</hi> addition; (for it produc'd thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
explicative Creeds more in a short time, as <hi>Marcus
Ephesius</hi> openly affirm'd in the Council of <hi>Florence;)</hi>
in the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which was the third general,
it was forbidden that ever there should be any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <hi>[That it should not be lawful

                     </note> meaning,
by addition or diminution. There are some so imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
weak as to expound these Canons to mean one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the adding any thing contrary to the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith;
which is an answer against reason and experience; for
it is not imaginable that any man, admitting the <hi>Nicene</hi>
Creed, can by an addition intend expressly to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it; and if he does not admit and believe it, he
would lay that Confession aside, and not meddle with
it: but if he should design the inserting of a clause
that should secretly undermine it; he must suppose all
men that see it to be very fools, not to understand it,
or infinitely careless of what they believe and profess:
but if it should happen so; then this were a very good
reason of the prohibition of any thing whatsoever to
be added, lest secretly and undiscernably the first truth
be confuted by the new article: And therefore it was
a wise caution to forbid all addition, lest some may


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64671:122"/>
prove to be contrary. And then secondly, it is against
the experience of things; for first the Canon was made
upon the occasion of a Creed brought into the Council
by <hi>Charisius;</hi> but all Creeds thereupon were rejected,
and the <hi>Nicene</hi> adhered to, and commanded to be so
for ever.<note place="margin">In Can. 7. vide Balsam. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> For as <hi>Balsamon</hi> observes, there were three
things done in this Canon; 1. There was an Edict made
in behalf of the things decreed at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> 2. In like
manner the holy Creed being made in the first Synod,
this Creed was read aloud, and caution was given
that no man should make any other Creed upon pain of
deposition, if he were an Ecclesiastick; of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
if he were a Laick. 3. The third thing he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
thus expresses [The same thing also is to be done to
them who receive and teach the decrees of <hi>Nestorius.]</hi>
So that the Creed that <hi>Charisius</hi> brought in was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
because it was contrary to the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith; but
all Symbols were for ever after forbidden to be made,
not onely lest any thing contrary be admitted, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would admit of no other; and this very
reason S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> assign'd why the Fathers of the
Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> denyed the importunity of some,<note place="margin">Epist ad Epict.</note> who
would have something added to the <hi>Nicene</hi> confession;
they would not do it, lest the other should seem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.
And next to this, it was carefully observed by
the following Councils, 4. 5. 6. and 7. and by it self in
a great Affair: for 1. though this Council determin'd
the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">

God,</hi> against <hi>Nestorius;</hi> yet, 2. the Fathers would not
put the Article into the Creed of the Church; but
esteemed it sufficient to determine the point and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>Nestorius:</hi> And 3. the <hi>Greek</hi> Church hath ever
since most religiously observ'd this <hi>Ephesine</hi> Canon:
And, 4. upon this account have vehemently spoken
against the Latines, for adding a clause at <hi>Gentilly</hi> in
<hi>France.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad Epict.</note> 5. S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> speaking of the <hi>Nicene Faith</hi>

or Creed, says, <hi>It is sufficient for the destruction of all
impiety, and for the confirmation of all the Holy Faith
in Christ:</hi> and therefore, there could be no necessity
of adding any thing to so full, so perfect an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and consequently, no reasonable cause pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
why it should be attempted: especially since there
had been so many, so intolerable inconveniencies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
introduc'd by adding to the Symbols their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Expositions. 6. The purpose of the Fathers
is fully declar'd by the Epistle of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cyril. Alex. ad Johan. Antioch. Sess. 5.</note> in which he
recites the Decree of the Council, and adds, as a
full explication of the Council's meaning, <hi>We permit
neither our selves nor others, to change one word or syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
of what is there.</hi> The case is here, as it was in
Scripture, to which no addition is to be made; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be diminished from it. But yet every Doctor
is permitted to expound, to inlarge the expressions,
to deliver the sense, and to declare (as well as they
can) the meaning of it. And much more might the
Doctors of the Church do to the Creed: To which,
although something was added at <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi>
yet from thence forward they might in private,
or in publick, declare what they thought was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and what were the consequents, and what was
virtually contain'd in the Articles; but nothing of
this by any authority whatsoever, was to be put into
the Creed. For in Articles of Belief, simplicity is part
of it's excellency and sacredness; and those mysterious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and life-giving Articles which are fit to be put
into Creeds, are, as <hi>Philistion</hi> said of <hi>Hellebore,</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
when it in great pieces, but dangerous, or deadly,
when it is in powder. And I remember what a Heathen
aid of the Emperour <hi>Constantius,</hi> who troubled himself
too much in curiosities, and nice arguings about things
Unintelligible, and Unnecessary: <hi>Christianam religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

simple; and they that conduct it, should compose all
the parts of it with gravity, not perplex it with curious
scrutinies; not draw away any word or Article, to the
sense of his own interest. For if it once pass the bounds
set by the first Masters of the Assemblies, and lose that
simplicity, with which it was invested; there is no
term or limit, which can be any more set down. <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla

devesting the Church from the simplicity of her Faith;
is like removing the ancient Land-mark: you cannot
tell by the mark, in what Countrey you are in, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in your own, or in the Enemies. And in the world
nothing is more unnecessary. For if that faith be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;
if in that faith the Church went to Heaven,
if in that she preserv'd unity, and begat Children to
Christ, and nurs'd them up to be perfect men in Christ,
and kept her self pure from Heresie, and unbroken by
Schism; whatsoever is added to it, is either contain'd
in the Article virtually, or it is not. If not, then it is
no part of the Faith, and, by the laws of Faith, there
is no obligation pass'd upon any man to believe it. But
if it be, then he that believes the Article, does vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
believe all that is virtually contain'd in it: but
no man is to be press'd with the consequents drawn
from thence; unless the Transcript be drawn by the
same hand, that wrote the Original; for we are sure
it came in the simplicity of it, from an infallible Spirit;
but he that bids me believe his Deductions under pain
of damnation, bids me under pain of damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he is an Unerring Logician: for which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <p>But let us see a little further, with what constancy,
That, and The following Ages of the Church, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the Apostles, Creed, as the sufficient, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Rule of Faith. There was an Imperial Edict of
<hi>Gratian, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius; Cunctos populos
quos clementiae nostrae regit imperium, in eâ volumus
religione versari, quam Divinum Petrum Apostolum
tradidisse Romanis, religio usque nunc ab ipso insi nua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
declarat; quámque pontificem Damasum sequi claret,
&amp; Petrum Alexandriae Episcopum, virum Apostolicae
sanctitatis: hoc est, ut, secundum Apostolicam discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,
Evangelicamque doctrinam, Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp;
Spiritus sancti Vnam Deitatem, sub pari majestate, &amp;
sub piâ Trinitate, credamus. Hanc legem sequentes
Christianorum Catholicorum nomen jubemus amplecti:
reliquos verò dementes vesanósque judicantes, Haeretici
dogmatis infamiam sustinere, divina primùm vindictâ,
pòst etiam motu animi nostri, quem ex coelesti arbitrio
sumpserimus, ultione plectendos.</hi> Part of this being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Dissuasive; to prove that in the early Ages
of the Church, the Christian Faith was much more
simple than it is now in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church;<note place="margin">The Letter to a friend. <hi>p. 4.</hi>
                     </note> and that
upon easier terms, men might then be Catholick: It was
replied by some one of the Opponents, <hi>That by this law
was not meant, that all who believ'd the Trinity, were
Catholicks absolutely, but only as to those points:</hi> and
the Reason given, is this, <hi>Because after this law,
the Novatians, Donatists, Nestorians, Eutychians,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>were proceeded against as Hereticks and Schismaticks,
notwithstanding their belief of the Trinity and Vnity
of the God-head:]</hi> But this thing was spoken, without
all care whether it were to the purpose or no. For
when this law was made, that was the Rule of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicism


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64671:124"/>
(as appears by the words of the law:) and if
afterward, it became alter'd, and the Bishops became
too opinionative, or thought themselves forc'd into
further declarations; must therefore the precedent
law be judged <hi>ex post facto</hi> by what they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
It might as well have been said; the Church
was never content with the Apostles Creed, because
afterwards the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians,</hi>
&amp;c. were proceeded against as Hereticks and
Schismaticks, notwithstanding their belief of all that is
in the Apostles Creed. <hi>Ex post facto nunquam crescit
praeteriti aestimatio,</hi> says the law. But for the true
understanding of this Imperial law, we must know
that the confession of the Holy Trinity and Unity, was
not set down there, as a single Article, but as a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
of the Apostles Creed; the three parts of which,
have for their heads, The three Persons of the holy
and undivided Trinity. And this appears by the
relation, the law makes to the faith Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
taught the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to the Creed of
<hi>Damasus,</hi> which may be seen in Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> who
rejects the Creed of that worthy Prelate, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Tome of his Works; in which the Apostolical
Creed is explicated, that what relates to the Trinity
and Unity, spoken of in the Imperial Law, or Rule of
Catholicks and Christians, is set down in it's full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and design: And this thing may better be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by an instance in the Catechism of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> for when the Catechumen hath at large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the Apostles Creed; he is taught to summe it up
in this manner: <hi>First, I learn to believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath made me, and all the world: Secondly,
In God the Son, who hath redeemed me, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
Thirdly, In God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth
me, and all the elect people of God.</hi> This is the Summary
of the Creed; and these things are not to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64671:124"/>
as Articles distinct and complete, and integra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Christian Faith, but as a breviary of that Faith,
to which in the same place it is made to relate; just as
the Imperial Law does relate to the Faith of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
and the Creed of <hi>Damasus,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria:</hi>
Concerning which, he that says much, says no more; and
he that says little, says no less; for the Faith is the same,
as I have already cited the words of S. <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Since
then the Emperours made the summary of the Apostles
Creed, to be the rule of discerning Catholicks from
Hereticks; it follows, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
signifies something else than it did in the primitive
Church. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> says, <hi>Faith is conceiv'd by the
Apostles Creed;</hi> all Faith lies in that, as the Child in
the Mother's Womb; and he compares it to a <hi>Key,</hi>
because <hi>by it the darknesses of the Devil are unlock'd,
that the light of Christ might come upon us; and the
hidden sins of conscience are opened, that the manifest
works of righteousness may shine. This Key is to be
shown to our Brethren, that by this, as Scholars of</hi> S.
Peter, <hi>they may shut the gates of Hell, and open the
doors of Heaven.</hi> He also calls it, <hi>The Seal of our
Heart,</hi> and <hi>the Sacrament of our Warfare.</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
speaking of it,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. contra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Now then since the whole Catholick Church of God
in the primitive ages, having not only declar'd that all
things necessary to salvation are sufficiently contain'd
in the plain places of Scripture; but that all, which the
Apostles knew necessary, they gathered together in a
Symbol or form of Confession, and esteem'd the belief
of this sufficient unto salvation; and that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
no more <hi>in credendis,</hi> as of necessity to Eternal
life, but the simple belief of these articles: these
things ought to remain in their own form and order.
For, what is and what is not necessary, is either such
by the Nature of the Articles themselves, or by the
Oeconomy of Gods Commandment: and what God
did command, and what necessary effect every Article
had, the Apostles onely could tell, and others from
them. They that pretend to a power of doing so as the
Apostles did, have shown their want of skill; and by
that, confess their want of power of doing that which
to do is beyond their skill. For, which sins are venial
and which are mortal, all the Doctors of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> cannot tell; and how then can they tell this of
Errors, when they cannot tell it of Actions? But if any
man will search into the harder things, or any more
secret Sacrament of Religion, by that means to raise up
his mind to the contemplation of heavenly things, and
to a contempt of things below, he may do it if he please,
so that he do not impose the belief of his own specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
upon others, or compel them to confess what
they know not, and what they cannot find in Scriptures,
or did not receive from the Apostles. We find by
experience, that a long act of Parliament, or an Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Covenant that is of great length, ends none,
but causes many contentions; and when many things
are defin'd, and definitions spun out into declarations,
men believe less, and know nothing more. And what
is Man, that he who knows so little of his own body,


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64671:126"/>
of the things done privately in his own house, of the
nature of the meat he eates; nay, that knows so little
of his own Heart, and is so great a stranger to the secret
courses of Nature? I say, what is man, that in the things
of God he should be asham'd to say, This is a secret;
This God onely knows;<note place="margin">S. Athanas. ep. ad Serapion.</note> This he hath not reveal'd; This
I admire, but I understand not; I believe, but I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it to be a mystery? And cannot a man enjoy the
gift which God gives, and do what he commands, but
he must dispute the Philosophy of the gift, or the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks
of a Command? Cannot a man eat Oysters,
unless he wrangle about the number of the senses
which that poor animal hath? and will not condited
Mushromes be swallowed down, unless you first tell
whether they differ specifically from a spunge?<note place="margin">S. Basil. de Spir. S. c. 13.</note> Is it
not enough for me to believe the words of Christ, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>This is my body?</hi> and cannot I take it thankfully,
and believe it heartily, and confess it joyfully; but I
must pry into the secret, and examine it by the rules of
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Porphyry,</hi> and find out the nature and the
undiscernable philosophy of the manner of its change,
and torment my own brains, and distract my heart, and
torment my Brethren, and lose my charity, and hazard
the loss of all the benefits intended to me, by the Holy
Body; because I break those few words into more
questions, than the holy bread is into particles to be
eaten? Is it not enough, that I believe, that, whether
we live or die, we are the Lord's, in case we serve him
faithfully? but we must descend into hell, and inquire
after the secrets of the dead, and dream of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the state of separation, and damn our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
if they will not allow us and themselves to be
half damn'd in Purgatory? Is it not enough that we are
Christians? that is, that we put all our hope in God,
who freely giveth us all things by his Son Jesus Christ;
that we are redeemed by his death, that he rose again


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64671:126"/>
for our justification; that we are made members of his
body in Baptism, that he gives us of his Spirit, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead to the lusts of this world we should live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his doctrine and example; that is, that we
do no evil, that we do what good we can; that we
love God, and love our Brother; that we suffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and do good things in expectation of better,
even of a happy Resurrection to eternal life, which he
hath promis'd to us by his Son, and which we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
if we walk in the Spirit, and live in the Spirit?
What is wanting to him that does all this? but that he
do so still? Is not this faith unto righteousness, and
the confession of this-faith, unto salvation? We all
believe we shall arise from our graves at the last day;
one sort of Christians thinks with one sort of body, and
another thinks with another; but these conjectures
ought not to be accounted necessary; and we are not
concern'd to dispute which it is; for we shall never
know by all our disputing; but we may lose the good
of it, if we make it an argument of Uncharitableness.
But besides this,</p>
                  <p>Did not the Apostles desire to know nothing but
Christ Jesus, and him crucified, and risen again? and
did not they preach this faith to all the world, and did
they preach any other; but severely reprove all curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and subtle questions, and all pretences of science, or
knowledge falsely so called, when men languished
about Questions and strife of words? Are we not
taught by the Apostles, that we ought not to receive
our weak Brother unto doubtful disputations; and
that the servant of God ought not to strive? Did not
they say, that all that keep the foundation shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
some with, and some without loss? and that
erring brethren are to be tolerated; and that if they
be servants of God, and yet, in a matter of doctrine or
opinion, <hi>otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this also


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64671:127"/>
unto them?</hi> And if these things be thus, Why shall one
Christian Church condemn another, which is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same foundation with her self? And how can it
be imagined, that the servants of God cannot be sav'd
now as in the days of the Apostles? Are we wiser than
they, are our Doctors more learned, or more faithful?
Is there another Covenant made with the Church since
their days? or is God less merciful to us, than he was
to them? Or hath he made the way to heaven narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the end of the world, than at the beginning of
the Christian Church? Do men live better lives now,
than at the first; so that a holy life is so enlarged, that
the foundation of faith laid at first is not broad enough
to support the new buildings? We find it much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
And men need not enlarge the Articles and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Faith in these degenerate ages, wherein when
Christ comes he shall hardly upon earth find any faith
at all: and, if there were need, yet no man is able to do
it, because Christ onely is our Lord and Master, and no
man is Master of our faith.</p>
                  <p>But to come closer to the thing. It is certain, There
is nothing simply necessary to salvation now, that was
not so always: and this must be confess'd by all that
admit of the so much commended rule of <hi>Vincentius
Lirinensis; That which was always, and every where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by all; that's the rule of faith:</hi> and therefore,
there can be no new measure, no new Article, no new
determination, no declaration obliging us to believe
any proposition that was not always believ'd. And
therefore as, that which was first is true, that which
was at first, and nothing else, is necessary. Nay, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
many truths to be found out by industry, and by
Divine Assistances, yet no more can be necessary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
nothing of this could ever be wanting to the
Church. Therefore the new discover'd truth cannot
of it self be necessary. Neither can the discovery


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64671:127"/>
make it necessary to be believ'd, unless I find it to be
discover'd and reveal'd by him, whose very discovery,
though accidental, yet can make it necessary; that is,
unless I be convinced that God hath spoken it: Indeed,
if that happen, there is no further inquiry. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are no new revelations since the Apostles
died, whatever comes in after them is onely by mans
ratiocination: and therefore can never go beyond a
probability in it self, and never ought to pretend
higher, lest God's incommunicable right be invaded,
which is to be the Lord of humane Understandings.
The consequent of all this is, There can be nothing of
necessity to be believ'd, which the Church of God,
taught by the Apostles, did not believe necessary.</p>

                  <p>NOw then having establish'd the Christian Rule and

offering to enlarge the Faith, to add new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
to the Belief of Christians; and imposes them
under pain of damnation. And this I prove, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they pretend to a power to do it. 2. They
have reason and necessity to do so in respect of their
interest, and they actually do so both in faith and
manners. 3. They use indirect and unworthy arts that
they may do it without reproach and discovery. 4. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64671:128"/>
done this, they, by enlarging Faith, destroy Charity.</p>
                  <p>1. They pretend to a power to do it. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
which were brought in the first part of the
Dissuasive,<note place="margin">Chapt. 1. Sect. pag. 10. edit. Dublin 1664.</note> did sufficiently prove this; but because
they were snarl'd at, I shall justifie, and enlarge them,
and confirm their sense by others. First, the Pope hath
authority (as his Doctors teach the world) to declare
an Article of Faith, and this is as much as the Apostles
themselves could do; that is, As the Apostles, by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the necessary Articles of Faith, made up a
Symbol of what things are necessary, and by their
imposing this Collection on all Churches, their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
into that Faith, their making it a Rule of Faith
to all Christians, did declare, not only the truth, but
the necessity of those Articles to be learn'd, and to be
believ'd; So the Pope also pretends he can declare.
For declaring a thing <hi>to be true,</hi> and declaring it to
be <hi>an Article of Faith,</hi> are things of vast difference.
He that declares it only to be true, imposes no necessity
of believing it; but if he can make it appear to be true,
he, to whom it so appears, cannot but believe it. But
if he declares it to be an Article of Faith, he says, that
God hath made it necessary to be known, and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd;
and if any hath power to declare this, to declare
I say, not as a Doctor, but as an Apostle, as Jesus Christ
himself, he is Master and Lord of the Conscience. Now
that the Pope pretends to this, we are fiercely taught
by his Doctors, and by his Laws. Thus the Gloss
upon the <hi>Extravagant de verborum significatione,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gloss ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Cap.
Cum inter. verb. Declaramus,</hi> says, <hi>He being Prince of
the Church, and Christ's Vicar, can in that capacity
make a declaration upon an Article of the Catholick
Faith.</hi> He can declare it <hi>authoritativè,</hi> not only as a
Doctor, but as a Prince; by Empire and Command,
as <hi>Princeps Ecclesiae.</hi> The <hi>Sorbon</hi> can Declare as well
as he upon the Catholick Faith, if it be only matter of


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64671:128"/>
skill and learning; but to declare <hi>so,</hi> as to bind every
man to believe it; to declare so, as the Article shall
be a point of Faith, when before this Declaration, it
was not so <hi>quoad nos;</hi> this is that, which is pretended
be <hi>declaring:</hi> And so this very Gloss expounds it; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the former words <hi>[The Pope can make an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith, if an Article of Faith be taken not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
but largely, that is, for a Doctrine which now we
must believe, whereas, before such declaration, we are
not tied to it.</hi> These are the words of the Gloss. The
sense of which is this; There are some Articles of
Faith, which are such before the declaration of the
Church, and some which are by the Churches decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made so: some were declar'd by the Scriptures,
or by the Apostles; and some by the Councils, or
Popes of <hi>Rome:</hi> after which declaration, they are
both alike, equally necessary to be believ'd; and this
is that which we charge upon them, as a dangerous and
intolerable point. For it says plainly, that whereas
Christ made some Articles of Faith, the Pope can
make others; for if they were not Articles of Faith,
before the declaration of the Pope, then he makes
them to be such; and that is truely (according to their
own words) <hi>facere Articulum fidei:</hi> this is making an
Article of Faith. Neither will it suffice to say; that
this Proposition, so declar'd, was, before such a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
really and indeed, an Article of Faith in it self;
but not in respect of us. For this is all one in several
words. For an Article of Faith is a relative term; it
is a Proposition which we are commanded to believe,
and to confess: and to say, This is an Article of Faith,
and yet that no man is bound to believe it, is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Now then, let it be considered: No man is bound
to believe any Article till it be declar'd; as no man is
bound to obey a Law, till it be promulgated; Faith
comes by hearing; till there be hearing, there can be


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64671:129"/>
no Faith; and therefore no Article of Faith. The
truth is Eternal; but Faith is but temporary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the declaration. Now then, suppose any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle:
I demand, did Christ and his Apostles declare
it to the Church? If not, how does the Pope know it,
who pretends to no new Revelations? If the Apostles
did not declare it, how were they faithful in the house
of God?<note place="margin">Acts 20. 27.</note> and how did S. <hi>Paul</hi> say truly, <hi>I have not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or ceased,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to <hi>declare,</hi> to annunciate to you
all the whole Counsel of God. But if they did say
true, and were faithful, and did declare it all; then
was it an Article of Faith, before the Pope's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and then it was a sin of ignorance not to believe
it, and of malice, or pusillanimity not to confess it, and
a worse sin to have contradicted it. And who can
suppose that the Apostolical Churches and their descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
should be ignorant in any thing that was then a
matter of Faith? If it was not then, it cannot now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
that it was so then; for to declare a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
is to publish what it was before; if it was then,
there needs no declaration of it now, unless by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
we mean preaching it, and then every Parish
Priest is bound to do it, and can do it as well as
the Pope. If therefore they mean more, as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they do, then, Declaring an Article of Faith is but
the civiller word for Making it. Christ's preaching,
and the Apostles imposing it, made it an Article of
Faith, in it self and to us; other declaration except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only teaching, preaching, expounding and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we know none, and we need none; for they only
could do it, and, it is certain, they did it fully.</p>
                  <p>But I need not argue, and take pains to prove that
by Declaring, they mean more than meer Preaching;
Themselves own the utmost intention of the Charge.
The Pope can <hi>statuere Articulos fidei;</hi> that's more
than <hi>declare</hi> meerly; it must be to <hi>appoint,</hi> to <hi>decree,</hi>


                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:64671:129"/>

give a very considerable Instance, which relies not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Credit and testimony of their Doctors, but is
matter of fact, and notorious to all the World. For
it will be to no purpose for them to deny it, and say,
that the Pope can only declare an Article, but not make
a new one. For it is plain, that they so declare an old


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64671:130"/>
one, that they bring a new one in; they pretend the
old Creed to be with Child of a Cushion, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
a suppositious Child of their own. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
I mean, is, that Article of the Apostles Creed, <hi>I
believe the holy Catholick Church:</hi> The Question is
made, What is meant by it? They that have a mind
to it, understand it easily enough; it was a declaration
of the coming of the Messias into the world; the great
proof that Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the <hi>Shiloh,</hi> or he that
was to come. For whereas the Jews were the Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and peculiar people of God; at the comming of
the Messias it should be so no more; but the Gentiles
being called, and the sound of the Gospel going into
all the world, it was no more the Church of the Jews,
but <hi>Ecclesia totius mundi,</hi> the Church of the Universe,
the Universal, or Catholick Church; of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
of all people, and all Languages. Now this great
and glorious mystery, we confess in this Article; that
is, we confess, that God hath given to his Son, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
for an Inheritance, and the utmost parts <hi>of
the world</hi> for a possession; that <hi>God is no respecter
of persons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 10. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and
worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</hi> This is
the plain sense of the Article, and renders the Article
also highly considerable, and represents it as Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;
and it is agreeable with the very Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Gospel; and determines one of the greatest
questions that ever were in the world, the dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Jews and Gentiles; and is not only easie,
and intelligible, but greatly for Edification.</p>
                  <p>Now then, let us see how the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by
her Head and Members, expound, or declare this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
I believe the Holy Catholick Church; so it is
in the Apostles Creed. I believe one Holy, Catholick,
and Apostolick Church; so the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. Here
is no difference, and no Commentary; but the same


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64671:130"/>
thing with the addition of one word to the same sense;
onely it includes also the first Founders of this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church; as if it had been said, I believe that the
Church of Christ is disseminated over the world, and
not limited to the Jewish pale; and that this Church
was founded by the Apostles upon the rock Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath handled this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
after another manner; she hath explain'd it so
clearly, that no wise man can believe it; she hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
the Article so as to make it a new one, and made
an addition to it that destroys the principal: <hi>Sanctam
Catholicam &amp; Apostolicam Romanam Ecclesiam, omnium
Ecclesiarum Matrem &amp; Magistram agnosco,</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the holy Catholick and Apostolick Roman
Church, the Mother and Mistress of all Churches. And
at the end of this declaration of the Creed, it is added
as at the end of the Athanasian; This is the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
faith, without which no man can be saved. And
this is the Creed of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, enjoyn'd to
be sworn by all Ecclesiasticks, secular or Religious. Now
let it be considered, Whether this Declaration be not a
new Article, and not onely so, but a destruction to the
old. 1. The Apostolical Creed professes to believe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the Catholick or Universal Church: The Pope limits it,
and calls it the Catholick Roman Church; that, by <hi>all</hi> he
means <hi>some,</hi> and the <hi>Vniversal</hi> means but <hi>particular.</hi> But
besides this, 2. It is certain, this must be a piece of a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Creed; since it is plain, the Apostles did no more intend
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church should be comprehended under the
Catholick Church, than as every other Church which
was then, or should be after. And why <hi>Roman</hi> should
be put in, and not the <hi>Ephesine,</hi> the <hi>Caesarean,</hi> or the
<hi>Hierosolymitan,</hi> it is not to be imagined. 3. This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
must needs be a new Article, because the full sense
and mystery of the old Article was perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
before the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was in being. <hi>I believe


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64671:131"/>
the holy Catholick Church,</hi> was an Article of faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> there was any <hi>Roman</hi> Church at all. 4. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing
<hi>the Roman</hi> into the Creed, as equal, and of
the extent with the Catholick, is not onely a false, but a
malicious addition. For they having perpetually in
their mouths, <hi>That out of the Catholick Church there
is no Salvation;</hi> and now against the truth, simplicity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and design of the Apostolical Creed, having made
the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> to be all one: they have also
establish'd this doctrine as virtual part of the Creed,
that out of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
there is no Salvation to be hoped for; and so by this
means damn all the Christians of the world who are
not of their Communion; and that is the far biggest
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> part of the Catholick Church. 5. How intolerable a
thing it is to put the word <hi>Roman</hi> to expound <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
in the Creed; when it is confess'd among<note n="*" place="margin">Driedo de dogmat. Eccl. lib. 4. c. 3. p. 3.</note> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that it is not of faith, <hi>that the Apostolick Church

                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
proves this; because there is neither Scripture nor Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that affirms it: and then if ever they be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Apostolick be remov'd to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
then the Creed must be chang'd again, and it must run
thus, I believe the holy Catholick, and Apostolick <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinopolitan</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Church. 6. There is, in this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Apostolical Creed, a manifest untruth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
enjoyn'd, profess'd and commanded to be sworn
to, and that is, that <hi>the Roman Church is the Mother of all
Churches:</hi> when it is confessed that S. <hi>Peter</hi> sate Bishop
at <hi>Antioch</hi> seven years before his pretended coming to
<hi>Rome:</hi> and that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is the Mother of all
Churches. For the Law went forth out of Sion, and the
Word of the Lord from Hierusalem:<note place="margin">Apud Baron. AD. 382. n 15.</note> and therefore
the Oecumenical Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> said,<note place="margin">Vide etiam S. Basil, tom. 2. ep. 30. &amp; Greg. Theol.</note> 
                     <hi>We shew unto you Cyril the
Bishop of Jerusalem, which is the Mother of all other


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64671:131"/>
Churches.</hi> The like is said of the Church of <hi>Cesarea,</hi>
(with an exception onely of Jerusalem,) <hi>quae prope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
omnium Ecclesiarum, &amp; fuit ab initio, &amp; nune
quoque est, &amp; nominatur: quam Christiana respublica,
velut centrum suum circulus, undique observat.</hi> How
this saying of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Divine can consist with the
new Roman Creed, I leave it to the Roman Doctors to
consider. In the mean time, it is impossible that it
should be true, that the Roman Church is the Mother
of all Churches, not onely because it is not imaginable
she could beget her own Grand-mother; but for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
pretty reason, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath invented;
<q>[Though the Ancients every where call the Roman
Church the Mother of all Churches,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Rom.</note> and that all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
had their Consecration and Dignity from her;<note place="margin">Pontif. c. 23. <hi>Sect.</hi> Secunda ratio.</note>
yet this seems not to be true, but in that sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> he ordain'd all the
Apostles and all other Bishops, by himself, or by
others. Otherwise since all the Apostles constituted
very many Bishops in divers places, if the Apostles
were not made Bishops by <hi>Peter,</hi> certainly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of Bishops will not deduce their original from
<hi>Peter.]</hi>
                     </q> This is <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s argument, by which he
hath perfectly overthrown that clause of <hi>Pius quartus</hi>
his Creed; that <hi>the Roman Church is the Mother of all
Churches.</hi> He confesses she is not, unless S. <hi>Peter</hi> did
consecrate all the Apostles; he might have added, No,
nor then neither, unless <hi>Peter</hi> had made the Apostles
to be Bishops, after himself was Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> for
what is that to the Roman Church, if he did this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was the Roman Bishop? But then that <hi>Peter</hi>
made all the Apostles Bishops is so ridiculous a dream,
that in the world nothing is more unwarrantable. For,
besides that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was consecrated by none but Christ
himself, it is certain that he ordain'd <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
and that the succession in those Churches ran from


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64671:132"/>
the same Original in the same Line; and there is no
Record in Scripture that ever S. <hi>Peter</hi> ordain'd any;
not any one of the Apostles who receiv'd their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from Christ and the Holy Spirit, in the same times
altogether: which thing is also affirm'd by<note n="a" place="margin">Institut. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. part. 2 l. 4. c. 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera opinio.</note>

                     <hi>Austin,</hi> and the Gloss. So that from first to last, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that the Roman Church is not the Mother-Church,
and yet every Priest is sworn to live and die in
the belief of it, that she is. However, it is plain, that
this <hi>assumentum</hi> and shred of the Roman Creed, is such
a declaration of the old Article of believing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, that it is not onely a direct new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of faith but destroys the old.</p>
                  <p>By thus handling the Creed of the Catholick Church
we shall best understand what they mean, when they
affirm that the Pope can interpret Scripture <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi>
and <hi>he can make Scripture. Ad quem pertinet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram
Scripturam authoritativè interpretari: Ejus enim
est interpretari, cujus est condere. He that can make
Scripture can make new Articles of faith surely.</hi> Much
to the same Purpose are the words of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the
fourth,<note place="margin">Innocent. 4. in cap. super eo. de Bigamis.</note> 
                     <hi>He cannot onely interpret the Gospel, but adde to
it.</hi> Indeed if he have power to expound it <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi>
that is as good as making it; for by that means
he can adde to it, or take from the sense of it. But
that the Pope can do this, that is, can interpret the
Scriptures <hi>authoritativè, sententialitèr, obligatoriè,</hi>
so as it is not lawful to hold the contrary, is affirm'd by
<hi>Augustinus Triumphus</hi>

                     <note n="c" place="margin">De potestate Papae.</note>.
And Cardinal <hi>Hosius</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">De expresso Dei verbo &amp; in Epilogo.</note> goes beyond this, saying, <q>That

affirmed, that the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the Pope's, is greater than the authority of the
Scriptures. These things being so notorious, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with what confidence <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can say, That
the Catholicks, meaning his own parties, <hi>do not subject
the Scripture, but preferre it before Councils; and that
there is no controversie in this;</hi> when the contrary is
so plain in the pre-alledged testimonies: but because
his conscience check'd him in the particular, he thinks
to escape with a distinction: If the Catholicks some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
say, That the Scriptures depend upon the Church,
or a Council, they do not understand it, in respect of
authority, or in themselves; but by explication, and in
relation to us<note n="*" place="margin">Bellarm. de Concil. author. lib. 2. cap. 12. Sect. Diximus.</note>. Which is too crude an affirmative to
be believ'd: for, besides that <hi>Pighius</hi> in his Epistle to
<hi>Paul</hi> III. before his Books of Ecclesiastical Hierarchy
affirms, that the whole authority of the Scripture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the Church; and the Testimonies, above
cited, doe in terms confute this saying of his; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
it self, helps not all: for if the Scriptures
have <hi>quoad nos,</hi> no authority, but what the Pope, or
the Church is pleas'd to give them; then they have in
themselves none at all. For <hi>the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for our learning;</hi> not to instruct the Angels, but


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64671:133"/>
to conserve the truths of God for the use of the Church;
and they have no other use or design; And if a man
shall say the Scriptures have in themselves great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
he must mean that in themselves they are highly
credible <hi>quoad nos,</hi> that is, that we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them for their own truth and excellency. And if
a man shall say, They have no authority <hi>quoad nos,</hi> but
what the Church gives them; he says, They are not
credible in themselves, and, <hi>in se,</hi> have no authority; so
that this distinction is a Metaphysical Nothing, and is
brought only to amuse men that have not leisure to
consider. And he that says one, says the other; or as bad,
under a thin and transparent cover. The Church
gives testimony external, to the Scripture; but the
internal authority is inherent and derives only from
God. But let the witness of the Church be of as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
force, as can be desir'd, I meddle not with it here;
but that which I charge on the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, is, that
they give to their Church a power of introducing, and
imposing new Articles of Belief; and pretending that
they have power so to do; and their definitions are of
authority equal (if not superiour) to the Scriptures.

did the Ancient Churches to the kindness and Religion
of the Emperour; and, if it were so, or not so, it is
but matter of Discipline, and cannot by a simple denial
of it, become an Heresie. So that what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
is not the opinion of some private Doctors, but
the publick practise of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.<note place="margin">Lib. Benedicti de Benedict. Bon niae excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. A. D. 1600.</note>

by what himself says concerning the business of the

                  <p>2. That which I am next to represent, is, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath reason and necessity to pretend
to this power of making new Articles; for they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the body of their Articles, and in the publick
Doctrines allowed by them, and in the profession and
practises of their Church, so many new things, which
at least seem contrary to Scripture, or are not at all in
Scripture; and such for which it is impossible to shew
any Apostolical, or Primitive tradition, do easily and
openly betray their own weakness and necessity in
this affair. My first Instance is of their known Arts of
abusing the people, by pretended Apparitions, and
false Miracles, for the establishing of strange Opinions.

must needs be things that come over the Walls, and
in at the Windows; they come not the right way.

For besides that,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>that miracles should be done; and now it is
profitable, that they be not done:</hi> for then our Faith
was finished by Miracles, but now by the Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:]
Miracles are like watering of plants, to be
done when they are newly set, and before they have
taken root. Hence the Apostle saith, <hi>Tongues are for
a sign to them that believe not, and not for them that
believe.]</hi> So S. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Homil. 29. in Evangel.</note> 
                     <hi>Our Ancestors followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <hi>he that yet looks

Nay, to pretend Miracles now adays, is the worst sign
in the world. And here S. <hi>Austin</hi> in great zeal, gives
warning of such things as these. <q>[<note n="c" place="margin">Id de civit. Dei l. 22. c. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Let not a man say,

remov'd. For either those things which are spoken,
are not true, or if any miracles of Hereticks be done,
we ought to take heed the more. Because when our

do signs, and deceive, if it were possible, the very Elect;

                     <note place="margin">Johan. Homil. 49.</note>
imputed to Saint <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who calls the power of
working Miracles (after the first vocation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel)
<hi>seductionis adjutoria,</hi> the helps of seduction; as
at first they were us'd by Christ, and Christ's servants,
as instruments of vocation; and affirms, These helps of
deceit were to be <hi>deliver'd</hi> to the Devil.] It was the


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64671:135"/>
same in the Gospel, as it was in the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi>
after God had by signs and wonders in the hand of
<hi>Moses,</hi> fix'd and establish'd his Law, which only was
to be their Rule; and Caution was given, <hi>Deuter. 1. 13.</hi>
that against that Rule, no man should be believ'd,

unless it be to deceive; except this only, that where mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
are pretended, there is a warning also given, that
there is danger of deception, and there is the Seat of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-christ,

Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Miracles are pretended, that they
are a Cover fitted for their Dish; new miracles to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the old truths, and to introduce new opinions. For
to prove any Article of our Creed, or the necessity of a
Divine Commandment, or the Divinity of the Eternal
Son of God, there is now no need of miracles, and
for this way of proving these, and such Articles as
these, they trouble not themselves; but for Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
Adoration of the consecrated Bread and
Wine, for Purgatory, Invocation, and worship of
Saints, of their Reliques, of the Cross, Monastical

from some of the more sober and wise amongst them.

but when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had affirm'd that <hi>Nilus, Gerson,

had taught that the Pope might be a heretick, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
without a General Council; and in his censure of
them, affirm'd that this opinion is not <hi>propriè haeretica,</hi>
he plainly, by certain and immediate consequence,
confesses that for 1400 or 1500 years the Judgement
of the Pope was not esteem'd infallible. Now if this
be true, it is impossible that it can ever be determin'd
as a Catholick truth; for there is no Catholick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for it. There was not for many ages; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
either there is no Tradition in the present Church
for it, or if there be, it is contrary to the old Tradition:
and therefore, either the Tradition of the present
Church is no rule, or, if it be, it is a very new one; and
several ages are bound to believe contradictory propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.
That the Pope is above a Council is held by
some Roman Catholicks, and it is held so by all the
Popes, and hath without scruple been determin'd in

nay, it is <hi>ferè de fide,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Which
expression of his shows plainly, that Articles of faith
grow in the womb of the Roman Church, as an <hi>Embryo,</hi>
to be perfected when the Pope shall see his time. Nay,
if the Pope's definition <hi>in Cathedrâ</hi> be infallible, or if it
can be known where the Popes does define <hi>in Cathedrâ</hi>
this proposition that <hi>the Pope is above a Council</hi> is more


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64671:137"/>
than <hi>ferè de Fide:</hi> for, that <hi>the Council is superior,</hi> is

                     <note place="margin">A D. 1562.</note> and he threatned to persecute and chastise them.
And the like is to be said concerning that fine new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of faith made by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth (of which
I have spoken in the first Section) that a Pope cannot be
bound, much less can be bind himself, <hi>viz.</hi> by any

The number of the seven Sacraments is now
an Article of the Roman faith, taught in their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms,
determin'd in their Councils, preach'd in their
Pulpits, disputed for against their adversaries; and yet
the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> was the first Council, and <hi>Peter

Articles of Faith, which wholly depends upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

this, and many other Articles, is compell'd to challenge
a strange power even of making and imposing new
Creeds, or of quitting her new Articles. But the whole

                  <p>THey use indirect and unworthy arts, that they
may do it without reproach and discovery: and
for this I instance in the whole affair and annexes
of their Expurgatory Indices. Concerning which, three
things are said in the first part of this Dissuasive.
1. That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave a Commission to the
Inquisitors to purge all Catholick Authors, but with a
clause of secresie. 2. That they purg'd the <hi>Indices</hi> of
the Fathers works. 3. That they did also purge the
works of the <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves. The first and the last
are denied by them that wrote against the <hi>Dissuasive:</hi>
The second they confess, and endeavour to justifie.
But how well, will appear when I have first made good
the first and the last.</p>
                  <p>1. That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave a clancular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Inquisitors, can be denyed by no man
but by him that hath ignorance for his excuse; and
then also the ignorance ought rather to be modestly
confess'd,<note place="margin">E. W. page. 17. He is false and faulty
through this whole Section; faulty in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us of a clancular Commission given
by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Inquisitors, &amp;c.
without directing us to either Book or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi>
where to find it.] This Commission is
in <hi>Junius</hi> his Edition of the <hi>Indices Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorii;</hi>
and of this Book the author <hi>of a
Letter to a friend</hi> did make use, as appears
in his 6. page under <hi>n. 16.</hi>
                     </note> than a fault charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, who knowing it, did affirm
it. But the Commission is printed
both in <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> together
with the Expurgatory <hi>Indices</hi> of
<hi>Belgium</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> at <hi>Henovia</hi> or
<hi>Henault</hi> by <hi>Guilielmus Antonius,
1611.</hi> in which the King affirms
that he caus'd the Belgick <hi>Index</hi> to be printed by his
own chief Printer, at his own charge, <hi>Non quidem


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64671:138"/>
evulgandum, distrahendúmque; sed distribuendum solis
Cognitoribus,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after, giving faculty to
the Prelates to choose one or more Assistants, he addes,
<hi>Itque ipsi privatim nullisque consciis apud se Indicem
Expurgatorium habebunt, quem eundem neque aliis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municabunt,
neque ejus exemplum ulli dabunt, &amp;c.</hi> This
then is soon at an end.</p>
                  <p>2. But <hi>Junius</hi> that publish'd the <hi>Indices</hi> seems to
say that they did not purge the works of the Fathers.
To this the Answer that <hi>Junius</hi> himself makes is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
for he instances in their purgation of <hi>Bertram,</hi>

and yet they openly profess'd to use him as they please:
and when <hi>Bertram</hi> had said <hi>visibilitèr,</hi> they commanded
he should be read <hi>invisibilitèr:</hi> which is a pretty little
change, and very meet to <hi>Bertram</hi>'s sense surely. But
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> is also in this particular a witness beyond
exception;<note place="margin">lib. 4. De verb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is no way of finding truth but by the Scripture;

totus hic locus, tanquam ab Arianis insertus, è qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam
codicibus nuper emendatis sublatus est.</hi> But the
thing is plain also in the <hi>Indices</hi> themselves; for in the
Spanish <hi>Index</hi> by the Command of <hi>Gaspar Quiroga</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and in that also of <hi>Sandoval,</hi> the
purge hath pass'd upon the <hi>Bibliotheca sanctorum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi>
collected by <hi>Binius;</hi> where not onely the Gloss
upon S. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neocaesarea,</hi> but the works of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
the Abbot,<note place="margin">Pag. 282. Edit.</note> S. <hi>Melito, Mark</hi> the Hermit, <hi>Dorotheus,</hi>
and divers others,<note place="margin">Hanov. 1611.</note> are purg'd; and that the Reader
may be satisfied in the manner and design of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
the doctrines or saying to be blotted out are
these: <hi>[We have learn'd to worship and venerate that


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64671:139"/>
nature onely that is Vncreated: dele [solummodò]</hi> said
the good Fathers of the purges: <hi>Prudence, and Life,
and Piety, make the Priest. A wicked mind cannot be
justified. He that keeps not the Commandments, does not
believe rightly. Onely the Holy Trinity is properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal.
A spiritual prayer helps not an unclean mind.</hi>
These are all doctrines very dangerous and heretical,
and therefore though the Fathers teach them, yet <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur;</hi>
let them pass through the fire, and leave their
dross behind them. But I desire the Reader to observe
that when in the <hi>Sandoval</hi> Edition of the <hi>Index,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was taken for the purging the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi>
in the Edition of it at <hi>Colein,</hi> the <hi>Sandoval</hi> Canon was
not observ'd; and the reason given for it, was this, <hi>Lest
the hereticks may have occasion given them to insult;</hi>
which they could not do, unless they had taken their
adversaries in their tampering. But they are gone yet
one step further in this particular: for in the latter
Editions of the <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Edit. Paris. 1610.</note> they do not adde the
title of <hi>Sanctorum</hi> to them; but <hi>Patrum</hi> onely, and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticorum
Scriptorum;</hi> according to the order of
the <hi>Sandoval</hi> Expurgatory <hi>Index,</hi> printed at <hi>Madrid,
1612.</hi> and of the <hi>Quirogian Index,</hi> printed there 1583.
So that, as they are forc'd secretly to imply that they
are not so right for their Catholick cause, as they
would have them: so they are resolved, whatsoever
is not so, shall not pass with them for <hi>Holy.</hi> And in this
diminution and dishonour of the memory of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Fathers, S. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his good name
hath suffered shipwrack; for <hi>in</hi>

it happens in some measure to them that have in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

any thing against the errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as
it did to <hi>Arulenus Ruslicus</hi> praising of <hi>Paetus Thrasea,</hi>
and to <hi>Herennius Senecio</hi> commending <hi>Helvidius Priscus,


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64671:139"/>

Tables, their new-fashion'd diptychs; where men of
honourable name and great worth are called <hi>damnati
Authores,</hi> and their very name commanded to be put
out, and some <hi>Periphrasis</hi> set down for them.
2. But that I may give one pregnant instance of their
purging the Fathers; I desire him that is curious and
would be satisfied in this thing, to see the Edition of
S. <hi>Austin,</hi> at <hi>Venice;</hi> and in the inscription of his
Works he shall find this Confession, <q>[In quo, praeter
locorum multorum restitutionem secundum collationem
veterum Exemplarium, curavimus removeri illa omnia
quae fidelium mentes haereticâ pravitate possent infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
aut à Catholicâ Orthodoxâ fide deviare.]</q> And in
the <hi>Quirogian</hi> Index, which hath these words, <hi>Sunt
autem ferè omnia quae offendunt in Prologis &amp; Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalibus
Annotationibus,</hi> we may easily see, that not the
Prologues and Annotations alone are guilty, but even
S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s text. But beyond conjecture, the thing is in
it self evident. But the Fathers words are expunged in
one place, and consequently condemn'd in every place;
which is that I intended in the citation of those words
by <hi>Junius,</hi> and which were also set down in the first
part of this <hi>Dissuasive.</hi> But both in the <hi>text</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex
of S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Esai. lib. 1. c. 51. in fin.</note> these words are, and yet
commanded to be blotted, <hi>Habitat Jesus per fidem in
cordibus nostris.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 17.</note> Which very words are not in S. <hi>Cyril</hi>
only, but in S. <hi>Paul</hi> too; and by S. <hi>Cyril</hi> quoted with
a <hi>sicut scriptum est.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And again,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Index Quirog. p. 74.</note> Deleantur ex textu illa verba, Fidei

etiam paulum morbo affectis, satis ad emendationem va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lituram

commanded to be blotted, and yet they are both in
the</hi> Index <hi>and the text of S.</hi> Hierom.<note place="margin">In Epist. ad Rom. c. 10. haeres. 69.</note> 
                     <hi>So the Gloss of</hi>
Epiphanius <hi>of</hi> Creaturam non adorare <hi>is commanded to


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64671:140"/>
be blotted out; when the words of</hi> Epiphanius <hi>Text
are,</hi> Sancta Dei Ecclesia creaturam non, adorat, <hi>and it is
so in other places; of which the</hi> Indices <hi>themselves
are the best testimony. And that no man may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether they purg'd the Fathers, yea or no,</hi> Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Senensis <hi>said it to</hi> Pius Quintus, Deinde expurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
&amp; emaculari curasti omnia Catholicorum Scripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
ac praecipuè veterum Patrum Scripta: <hi>especially
the Writings of the ancient Fathers were purged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now true it is, that in the following words, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
a reason why he did so, and tells what things
were purg'd; <hi>even those things which were infected, and
poysoned by the Hereticks of our age.</hi> These last words,
and this reason, was not cited in the first part, when
the former words were made use of; and therefore
an out-cry was raised by them that wrote against it,
<note n="*" place="margin">F. W. <hi>p. 12.</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a Let. pag. 7.</note> as if they had been concealed by fraudulent design.
To which I answer, that I was not willing to interrupt
the order of my discourse, with quoting words which
are neither true, nor pertinent. For they have in them
no truth, and no good meaning. They are <hi>protestatio
contra factum;</hi> as being set there to perswade the
world, that none of the Fathers, or modern Catholicks
were purg'd, unless the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had corrupted
them; when all the world knows, they have purg'd
the Writings of the Catholicks old and new, Fathers
and Moderns, which themselves had printed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
allowed; but now being wiser, and finding them
to give too much evidence against them, they have
alter'd them. I could instance in many; but I shall
not need, since enough may be seen in Doctor <hi>James</hi>
his Table of Books, which were first set forth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
and afterwards censur'd by themselves. I shall
trouble my Reader but with one instance. That one is,
the work of <hi>Ferus</hi> upon S. <hi>John</hi>'s first Epistle, which
was printed at <hi>Antwerp 1556.</hi> with the privilege given


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64671:140"/>
by King <hi>Philip,</hi> to <hi>Martinus Nutius,</hi> with this Elogy.
<hi>Nam suae Majestati patuit librum esse omnino utilem,
&amp; nihil continere quod pias aures meritò offendere pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit.</hi>
The same Book was printed at <hi>Paris, 1555.</hi> by
<hi>de Marnet,</hi> and 1556. by <hi>Audoën Petit,</hi> or <hi>Parvus;</hi> at
<hi>Lyons, 1559.</hi> by <hi>Jacobus de Mellis;</hi> and the same year
at <hi>Lovain,</hi> by <hi>Servatius Sessenus,</hi> and at <hi>Mentz,</hi> where
he was Preacher, by <hi>Francis Behem;</hi> and after all
this, it was printed at <hi>Paris, 1563.</hi> by <hi>Gabriel Buon,</hi>
and at <hi>Antwerp, 1565.</hi> by the heirs of <hi>Nutius.</hi> Now
all these Editions were made by the Papists, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of; and no Protestant, no Heretick of that age
(that I may use the words of <hi>Senensis)</hi> had corrupted
them; neither is it pretended that they did: and yet
this Book was purg'd at <hi>Rome, 1577.</hi> and alter'd, added,
and detracted in 194. places: of the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of which alterations, I give this one Instance:
In the second Chapter, where <hi>Ferus,</hi> in the old Edition
of <hi>Mentz, Lovain, Antwerp,</hi> &amp;c. had these words,
<hi>Scriptura Sacra data est nobis ceu certa quaedam regula
Christianae doctrinae;</hi> But in the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition, 1577.
the words are chang'd thus; <hi>Sacra Scriptura &amp; Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio
nobis data sunt ceu certa quaedam regula Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae
doctrinae.</hi> By which Instance it plainly appears, that
the <hi>Inquisitors General,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> purge others
than what the Hereticks have corrupted, and that these
words of <hi>Sixtus Senensis,</hi> are but a false cover to a
foul dish, when they could no longer hide it. Nay,
even the Rules given by the Pope himself, <hi>Clement</hi> the
VIII<hi>th.</hi> give order for prohibiting the Books of the
Catholicks,<note place="margin">Reg. 6.</note> before they be purged. <hi>Si nonnulla con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineant
quae sine delectu ab omnibus legi non expedit:</hi>
and in the Preface to the <hi>Sandoval</hi> Index, it is said; <hi>Obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
autem in quorundam orthodoxorum libris nonnulli
lapsus aut quaedam obscurius dicta deprehensa, quibus
expurgatio, explicatio, aut cautio prudenter adhibita,


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64671:141"/>
ne minus cautos lectores contingat impingere.</hi> Which is
a plain indication, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> proceeds
in her purging of Books upon other accounts than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
the corruptions lately introduc'd by the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>
or <hi>Calvinists.</hi> And all this, and much more
being evident and notorious, there was reason then
to think, as I do still, that those words were of no use
to be added, unless to give occasion of impertinent
wrangling, but that there could be no other design in
it, is manifest by what I have now said. 3. But the
expurgatory <hi>Indices</hi> had the less need to do much of
this, since their work was done to their hands. For
the Fathers works had pass'd though fire <hi>Ordeal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">By the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Letter and <hi>E. W.</hi>
                     </note> many
times before. I instanc'd in the Edition of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
by <hi>Ludovicus Saurius,</hi> wherein many lines were can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellated,
and the Edition spoyled; and this was done
by the authority of two <hi>Franciscans;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Junius in Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad. Ind. Expurg. Belgic.</note> 
                     <hi>qui pro authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
has omnes paginas dispunxerunt ut vides, &amp; illas
substitui in locum priorum curaverunt, praeter omnem
librorum nostrorum fidem,</hi> said <hi>Saurius.</hi> Against this,
it is said, that it is a slander, because the <hi>Index Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorius,</hi>
was not appointed till the end of the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was <hi>An. Dom. 1563.</hi> and therefore
could not put a force upon <hi>Saurius,</hi> who corrected
this Book, and assisted at the Edition of it, 1559. To
which I answer; that it was not said, that the <hi>Index
Expurgatorius,</hi> put a force upon <hi>Saurius;</hi> but only a
force was put upon him: and, that it was so by two
<hi>Franciscans, Jnnius,</hi> who tells the story, does affirm.
2. For ought appears to the contrary, nay, most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it was so, that this force was put upon him by the
authority of the <hi>Expurgatorius Index;</hi> for though the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> appointed one a little before it's end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was in 1563; yet there was an Index made
before that, by P. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> who died four years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of the Council; and this he <hi>made by the


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64671:141"/>
Council of all the Inquisitors,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. Trident. in primâ Sessio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne sub Pio Quarto.</note> 
                     <hi>and of many famous men,
who sent him advice from all parts, and he made a most
complete Catalogue, to which nothing can be added, except
some Book come forth within two years,</hi> said <hi>Friar
Augustin Selvago,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Genua.</hi> So that here
was authority enough, and there wanted no zeal, and
here is matter of fact complained of, by the parties suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
4. It would indeed have been matter of great
scandal and reproach, to have openly handled all the
Fathers indifferently, as they us'd the Moderns; and
though (as I have prov'd) this did not wholly restrain
them, yet it abated much of their willingness; but
there was less need of it, because they had very well
purg'd them before; by cancellating the lines, by part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pages, by corrupting their Writings, by putting
Glosses in the Margent, and afterwards putting these
Glosses into the Text. <hi>Quod lector ineptiens annotârat in
margine sui codicis, Scribae retulerunt in contextum;</hi>
said <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his Preface to the Works of S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
to the Archbishop of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and the same also is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the <hi>Paris</hi>-overseers of the press, in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to their Edition of S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Works at <hi>Paris 1571.</hi>
by <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Nivellius.</hi> And this thing was noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in a considerable instance, in S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Pamelii annot. in librum.</note> 
                     <hi>de V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate
Ecclesiae;</hi> where after the words of Christ spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and recorded by S. <hi>Matthew;</hi> there
had been a marginal note, <hi>Hîc Petro primatus datur;</hi>
which words they have brought into the <hi>Roman,</hi> and
<hi>Antwerp</hi> Editions; but they have both left out <hi>Hîc,</hi>
and the <hi>Roman,</hi> instead of it, hath put <hi>Et.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the old Editions of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> even the <hi>Roman</hi> it
self, these words were, <hi>He who withstandeth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
the Church, doth he trust himself to be in the
Church?</hi> some body hath made bold to put the words
thus, in the Text of the Edition of <hi>Antwerp; He who
forsaketh Peter</hi>'s <hi>Chair, on which the Church is founded,


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64671:142"/>
doth he trust himself to be in the Church?</hi> But in how
many places that excellent Book of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlined,
and spoil'd by the new Correctors, is evident
to him that shall compare the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition with the
elder Copies, and them with the later Edition of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp;</hi>
and <hi>Pamelius</hi> himself, concerning some words,
saith,<note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Atque adeò non sumus veriti in textum inserere.</hi>
I could bring in many considerable instances, though
it be more than probable, that of forty falsities in the
abusing the Father's Writings by <hi>Roman</hi> hands, there
was not perhaps above one or two discoveries; yet
this, and many other concurrences might make it less
needful to pass their Sponges upon the Fathers. But
when the whole charge of printing of Books at <hi>Rome,</hi>
lies on the Apostolical See, as<note n="a" place="margin">Epist. l. 9. ad Jacobum Gorseium.</note> 
                     <hi>Manutius</hi> tells us; it
is likely enough, that all shall be taken care of, so as
shall serve their purposes. And so the Printer tells us,
viz.<note place="margin">In Praef. ad Pium, Quartm in librum Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis Poli de C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ncilio.</note> 
                     <hi>That such care was taken to have them so corrected,
that there should be no spot which might infect the minds
of the simple, with the shew or likeness of false doctrine.</hi>
And now by this, we may very well perceive, how the
force was put upon <hi>Saurius,</hi> in the purging S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
even by the Inquisitors; and that by the authority
and care of the Pope: and therefore though the
Works of most of the greater Fathers were not put into
the <hi>Expurgatory Indices,</hi> yet they were otherwise pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that is, most shamefully corrupted, torn and maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the lesser Fathers pass'd under the file in the
<hi>Expurgatory Indices</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>3. But then,<note place="margin">The Author of a Letter to a friend, <hi>pag 7.</hi> E. W. p. 20.</note> that they purg'd the <hi>Indices</hi> of the
Fathers Works, is so notorious, that it is confess'd,
and endeavour'd to be justified. But when we come to
consider, that many times the very words of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which are put into the <hi>Index,</hi> are commanded to
be expung'd, it at once shows, that fain they would,
and yet durst not expunge the words out of the Books,


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64671:142"/>
since they would be discover'd by their adversaries,
and they would suffer reproach without doing any
good to themselves. Now whereas it is said, [that
<hi>therefore the words of the Fathers are blotted out of the
Indices,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">E. W. p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>because they are set down without antecedents,
and consequents; and prepare the Reader to an ill sense:]</hi>
this might be possible, but we see it otherwise in the
Instances themselves, which oftentimes are so plain,
that no context, no circumstances, can alter the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
which is most of all notorious in the <hi>deleatur</hi>'s
of the <hi>Indices</hi> of the Bible set forth by <hi>Robert Stephen.
Credens Christo non morietur in aeternum,</hi> this is to be
blotted out;<note place="margin">Joh. 11. 26.</note> and yet Christ himself said it, <hi>Every one
that lives, and believes in me shall never die. Justus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.
Deo nemo,</hi> is to be blotted out of <hi>Robert Stephen</hi>'s

with thy servant, O Lord; for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.</hi> Now what antecedent, or what
context, or what circumstances can alter the sense of
these places; which being the same in the Text and
the Index, shews the good will of the Inquisitors;
and that like King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> his Tutor, they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the Prince upon his Page's back; and they have
given sufficient warning of the danger of those words
wherever they find them in the Fathers, since they have
so openly rebuked them in the <hi>Indices.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I made no distinction of places; but reckon'd
those words censur'd in the Expurgatory Tables as the
Fathers words censur'd or expung'd; and in this I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the style of their own Books, for in the <hi>Belgick
Index,</hi> the style is thus; <hi>In Hieronymi Operibus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pungenda,</hi>

in the same volume altogether; and, having the
same fate, and all upon the same account, I had reason
to charge it as I did.</p>

And how far the evil of this did proceed, may
easily be conjectur'd by what was done by the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the year 1559. in which there was a Catalogue
of 62 Printers; and all the books which any of them
printed, of what authour, or what language soever, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited;
and all books which were printed by Printers,
that had printed any books of Hereticks: insomuch
that not onely books of a hundred, two hundred, three
hundred years ago, and approbation, were prohibited,
but there scarce remained a book to be read.</p>
                  <p>But by this means they impose upon mens faith and
consciences; suffering them to allow of nothing in any
man, no not in the Fathers, but what themselves mark
out for them; not measuring their own doctrines by
the Ancients, but reckoning their sayings to be, or not
to be Catholick, according as they agree to their
present opinions: which is infinitely against the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
ingenuity, and confidence of truth, which needs
none of these arts. And besides all this, how shall it be
possible to find out tradition by succession, when they
so interrupt and break the intermedial lines? And this
is beyond all the foregoing instances very remarkable
in their purging of Histories. In <hi>Munsters</hi> Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
there was a long Story of <hi>Ludovicus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the house of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that made very much

and then there is made a formal story not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the mind of the Historian. And the same
<hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> publish'd a smart answer to the Bull

the face, the body, the innocence and the soul of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and the Epistles of Prince <hi>Frederick</hi>
the second, they pull out of the fift Tome of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Germane affairs,<note place="margin">In vitâ Julii Agric.</note>

of the honourable, and the Sentences of the wise; but
even hope to prevail upon the consciences of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,

be remembred by which themselves may be reprov'd.
But this is not agreeable to the simplicity and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of the Christian Religion.

                  </p>
                  <p>One thing more I am to adde here, that they are so
infinitely insecure in their errours, and so unsatisfied
with the learning of the world, and they find it so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to resist the frequent and publick testimonies of
truth; or indeed rather they so grow in errour, and so
often change their propositions; that they neither
agree at one time, nor does one time agree with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64671:144"/>
in their Purgations; that a Saint to day may be
a common person to morrow; and that which is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
doctrine now, next year may be heretical, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious,
or dangerous. The <hi>Speculum Oculare</hi> of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes
Capnio</hi> was approv'd by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth. It
was afterwards rejected by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth; and
him the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> following, and rejecting the
sentence of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> did also condemn it; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors,
to whom the making of the <hi>Index</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, caus'd it to be burnt: but
afterwards the Censors of <hi>Doway</hi> permit the book, and
so it is good again. What uncertainty can be greater
to consciences than what the ignorance or faction of
these men cause? Here is Pope against Pope, a Council
against the Pope; and the Monks Inquisitors of <hi>Doway</hi>
against both Pope and Council; and what can be the
end of these things? When the <hi>Quirogian Index</hi> came
forth, a man would think, there had been an end of so
much as was there purg'd: and certain it is, they were
cautious enough, and they purg'd all they thought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it:<note place="margin">Vide Praefatic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ad Lecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem in Ind. Sandov.</note> but yet when they of <hi>Salamanca</hi> published

defac'd and spoiled in the year 1586.</p>
                  <p>I need not observe, That in all the Expurgatory <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi>
you shall not find <hi>Gasper Schioppius,</hi> or the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
censur'd; nor <hi>Baronius,</hi> although he declared
the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily</hi> to belong to the Pope, and not
to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but if any thing escape which
lessens the Popes <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> (it is their own word)
then it is sure to fall under the Sponges and the Rasor:
so that this mystery of iniquity is too evident to be


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64671:144"/>
cover'd by the most plausible pretences of any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ested
advocate. But if this be the way, to stop all
mouths, but those that speak the same thing, it is no
wonder if they boast of unity: they might very well
do so; but that the providence of God, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules
all events, hath by his Almighty power divided
them, in despite of all their cunning arts to seem to be
sons of one mother: onely it will be now a much more
hard province, to tell when their errours first began,
since they have taken order to cut out the tongues of
them that tell us. And this they have done to their own
Canon-law it self, and to the old Glosses, in which there
were remaining some footsteps of the Ancient and
Apostolical Doctrine; upon which the craft of the

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64671:145"/>
away all their sins in a quarter of an hour: but if you
differ from them, even in the least point they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
you are not to be endur'd in this world, nor in
the world to come. Indeed this is one of the insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Characters of an Heretick; he sets his whole
Communion and all his charity upon his article; For
to be zealous in the Schism, that is the Characteristick
of a good man, that's his note of Christianity: In all
the rest he excuses you or tolerates you, provided
you be a true believer; then you are one of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
a good man and a precious, you are of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Saints, and one of the godly. All Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidians
do thus; and all that do thus are Solifidians,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self not excepted; for though
in words she proclaims the possibility of keeping all the
Commandments; yet she dispenses easier with him
that breaks them all, than with him that speaks one
word against any of her articles, though but the least;
even the eating of fish, and forbidding flesh in Lent. So
that it is faith they regard more than charity, a right
belief more than a holy life; and for, this you shall be
with them upon terms easie enough, provided you go
not a hairs breadth from any thing of her belief. For
if you do, they have provided for you two deaths and
two fires, both inevitable and one Eternal. And this
certainly is one of the greatest evils, of which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty: For this in it self is the
greatest and unworthiest Uncharitableness. But the
procedure is of great use to their ends. For the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of Christians are those that cannot consider
things leisurely and wisely, searching their bottoms,
and discovering the causes, or foreseeing events, which
are to come after; but are carried away by fear and
hope, by affection and prepossession: and therefore the
<hi>Roman</hi> Doctors are careful to govern them as they will
be governed; If you dispute, you gain, it may be,


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64671:145"/>
one, and lose five; but if ye threaten them with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
you keep them in fetters; for they that are
<hi>in fear of death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>are all their life time in bondage</hi> (saith
the Apostle:) and there is in the world nothing so
potent as fear of the two deaths, which are the two
arms and grapples of iron by which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> takes and keeps her timorous, or consciencious,
Proselytes. The easie Protestant calls upon you from
Scripture, to do your duty, to build a holy life upon
a holy Faith, the Faith of the Apostles, and first Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
of our Lord; he tells you, if you erre; and
teaches you the truth; and if ye will obey, it is
well; if not, he tells you of your sin, and that
all sin deserves the wrath of God; but judges no
man's person, much less any states of men. He knows
that God's Judgments are righteous and true; but he
knows also, that his Mercy absolves many persons,
who, in his just Judgment were condemn'd: and if he
had a warrant from God to say, that he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all the Papists, as <hi>Jonas</hi> had, concerning the
<hi>Ninevites;</hi> yet he remembers that every Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
if it be sincere, will do more, and prevail
greater, and last longer, than God's anger will. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these things, there is a strange spring, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
principle in every man's Understanding, that it
is oftentimes turned about by such impulses, of
which no man can give an account. But we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a most wonderful Instance of it, in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
between the two <hi>Reynolds's, John</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam;</hi>
the former of which being a Papist, and the later
a Protestant, met, and disputed, with a purpose to
confute, and to convert each other; and so they did:
for those Arguments which were us'd, prevail'd ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against their adversary, and yet did not prevail
with themselves. The Papist turned Protestant, and
the Protestant became a Papist, and so remain'd to their

But further yet, he
considers the natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
infirmities of mankind;
and God considers them much more; he knows that
in man there is nothing admirable but his ignorance,
and weakness; his prejudice, and the infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of being deceiv'd in many things: he sees, that
wicked men oftentimes know much more than many
very good men; and that the Understanding is not of
it self considerable in morality, and effects nothing in
rewards and punishments: It is the will only that rules
man, and can obey God. He sees and deplores it, that
many men study hard, and understand little; that they
dispute earnestly, and understand not one another at
all; that affections creep so certainly, and mingle with
their arguing, that the argument is lost, and nothing
remains but the conflict of two adversaries affections;
that a man is so willing, so easie, so ready to believe what
makes for his Opinion, so hard to understand an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against himself, that it is plain, it is the principle
within, not the argument without, that determines him:
He observes also that all the world (a few individuals ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
are unalterably determin'd to the Religion of
their Country, of their family, of their society; that there
is never any considerable change made, but what is made
by War and Empire, by Fear and Hope: He remembers
that it is a rare thing, to see <hi>Jesuit</hi> of the <hi>Dominican</hi>
Opinion; or a <hi>Dominican</hi> (untill of late) of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit;</hi>
but every order gives Laws to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Novices, and they never change: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64671:146"/>
there is such ambiguity in words, by which all
Law-givers express their meaning; that there is such
abstruseness in mysteries of Religion, that some things
are so much too high for us, that we cannot understand
them rightly; and yet they are so sacred, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that men will think they are bound to look into
them, as far as they can; that it is no wonder if they
quickly go too far, where no Understanding, if it were
fitted for it, could go far enough: but in these things
it will be hard not to be deceiv'd; since our words
cannot rightly express those things; that there is such
variety of humane Understandings, that mens Faces
differ not so much as their Souls; and that if there
were not so much difficulty in things, yet they could
not but be variously apprehended by several men;
and then considering that in twenty Opinions, it may
be not one of them is true; nay, whereas <hi>Varro</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd,
that among the old Philosophers, there were
800 Opinions concerning the <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and yet
not one of them hit the right: They see also that in all
Religions, in all Societies, in all Families, and in all
things, opinions differ; and since Opinions are too often
begot by passion, by passions and violences they are
kept; and every man is too apt to over-value his own
Opinion; and out of a desire that every man should
conform his judgment to his that teaches, men are apt
to be earnest in their perswasion, and over-act the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
and from being true, as he supposes, he will
think it profitable; and if you warm him either with
confidence, or opposition, he quickly tells you, It is
necessary; and as he loves those that think as he does,
so he is ready to hate them that do not; and then
secretly from wishing evil to him, he is apt to believe
evil will come to him; and that it is just it should:
and by this time, the Opinion is troublesome, and puts
other men upon their guard against it; and then while


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64671:147"/>
passion reigns, and reason is modest and patient, and
talks not loud like a storm, Victory is more regarded
than Truth, and men call God into the party, and his
judgments are us'd for arguments, and the threatnings
of the Scripture are snatched up in haste, and men
throw <hi>arrows, fire-brands, and death,</hi> and by this time
all the world is in an uproar. All this, and a thousand
things more, the <hi>English</hi> Protestants considering, deny
not their Communion to any Christian who desires it,
and believes the Apostles Creed, and is of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the four first General Councils; they hope
well of all that live well; they receive into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
all true believers of what Church soever; and
for them that erre, they instruct them, and then leave
them to their liberty, to stand or fall before their own
Master.</p>
                  <p>It was a famous saying of <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Great King
of <hi>Poland;</hi> that God had reserved to himself three
things. 1. To make something out of nothing. 2. To
know future things, and all that shall be hereafter.
3. To have the rule over Consciences. It is this last,
we say, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does arrogate and invade.</p>
                  <p>1. By imposing Articles, as necessary to salvation,
which God never made so. Where hath God said;

the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> says it; and by that, at one blow,

which is an Act so contrary to charity, to the
hope and piety of Christians, so dishonourable to the
Kingdom of Christ, so disparaging to the justice, to
the wisdom and the goodness of God, as any thing
which can be said. Where hath it been said, That it
shall be a part of Christian Faith, To believe, that
though the Fathers of the Church did Communicate


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64671:147"/>
Infants, yet they did it without any opinion of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
And yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath determin'd it,
in one of her General Councils,<note place="margin">Sess. 1. cap. 4</note> as a thing, <hi>Sine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversiâ
Credendum,</hi> to be believ'd without doubt,
or dispute: It was indeed the first time that this was
made a part of the Christian Religion; but then let
all wise men take heed how they ask the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> Where was this part of her Religion before the
Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> for that's a secret: and, that this is
a part of their Religion, I suppose will not be denied,
when a General Council hath determin'd it to be a
truth without controversie, and to be held according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Where hath God said, that those Churches that
differ from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in some propositions
cannot conferre true Orders, nor appoint Ministers of
the Gospel of Christ? and yet, <hi>Super totam materiam,</hi>
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is so implacably angry, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
with the Churches of the Protestants, that, if
any <hi>English</hi> Priest turn to them, they re-ordain him;
which yet themselves call sacrilegious, in case his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ordination was valid; as it is impossible to prove
it was not, there being neither in Scripture, nor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
tradition any Laws, Order, or Rule, touching
our case in this particular. Where hath God said, that
Penance is a Sacrament, or that without confession
to a Priest, no man can be sav'd? If Christ did not
institute it, how can it be necessary? and if he did
institute it, yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought not to say,
it is therefore necessary; for with them an Institution
is not a Command, though Christ be the Institutor;
and if Institution be equal to a Commandment, how
then comes the Sacrament not to be administred in
both kinds; when it is confessed, that in both kinds
it was instituted?</p>
                  <p>2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does so multiply Articles,
that few of the Laity know the half of them, and yet


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64671:148"/>
imposes them all under the same necessity; and if in
any one of them, a man make a doubt he hath lost all
Faith, and had as good be an Infidel; for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's
Authority being the formal object of Faith, that
is the only reason why any Article is to be believ'd;
the reason is the same in all things else: and therefore
you may no more deny any thing she says, than all she
says; and an Infidel is as sure of Heaven, as any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is that calls in question any of the innumerable
propositions, which with her are esteem'd <hi>de fide.</hi> Now
if it be considered, that some of the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrines
are a state of temptation to all the reason of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as the <hi>doctrine of Transubstantiation;</hi> that some
are at least of a supicious improbity, as <hi>worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and of the <hi>consecrated Elements,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
some are of a nice and curious nature, as the
<hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Merit,</hi> of <hi>Condignity</hi> and <hi>Congruity;</hi> some
are perfectly of humane inventions, without ground
of Scripture, or Tradition, as the formes of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Absolution, &amp;c. When men see, that some things
can never be believ'd heartily, and many not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
fully, and more not remembred, or consider'd
perfectly, and yet all impos'd upon the same necessity;
and as good believe nothing, as not every thing; this
way is apt to make men despise all Religion, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of their own Salvation. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath a remedy for this; and by a distinction under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to save you harmless: you are not tied to believe
all with an explicite Faith; it suffices that your Faith
be implicite, or involved in the Faith of the Church;
that is, if you believe that she says true in all things,
you need inquire no further: So that by this means,
the authority of their Church is made authentick, for
that is the first and last of the design; and you are
taught to be sav'd by the Faith of others; and a
Faith is preached, that you have no need ever to look


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64671:148"/>
after it; a Faith, of which you know nothing; but it
matters not, as long as others do: but then it is also a
Faith, which can never be the foundation of a good life;
for upon ignorance, nothing that is good, can be built;
no not so much as a blind obedience; for even blindly
to obey, is built upon something, that you are bidden
explicitely to believe; <hi>viz.</hi> the infallibility, or the
authority of the Church: but upon an implicite Faith,
you can no more establish a building, than you can
number that which is not. Besides this, an implicite
Faith in the Articles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not
sense; it is not Faith at all, that is not explicite; <hi>Faith
comes by hearing,</hi> and not <hi>by not hearing:</hi> and the people
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church believe one proposition expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely,
that is, <hi>that their Church cannot erre;</hi> and then
indeed, they are ready to believe any thing they tell
them; but as yet they believe nothing but the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Guides: and to call that Faith, which
is but a readiness, or disposition to have it, is like fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a man's belly with the meat he shall eat to morow
night; an act of Understanding antedated. But when
it is consider'd in it's own intrinsick nature and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
it effects this proposition, that <hi>these things are
indeed no objects of that Faith, by which we are to be
sav'd</hi> (for it is strange, that men having the use of
reason, should hope to be sav'd by the merit of a Faith
that believes nothing, that knows nothing, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
nothing) <hi>but that our Faith is completed
in the essential notices of the Evangelical Covenant, in
the propositions which every Christian man and woman
is bound to know;</hi> and that the other propositions are
but arts of Empire, and devices of Government; or the
Scholastick confidence of Opinions; something to amuse
consciences, and such by which the mystick persons may
become more knowing and rever'd than their poor
Parishioners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:64671:149"/>
3. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> determines trifles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
propositions, and adopts them into the
family of faith; Of this nature are many things which
the Popes determine in their chairs, and send them
into the world as oracles. What a dangerous thing
would it be esteem'd to any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, if he
should dare to question, Whether the Consecration of
the Bread and Wine be to be done by the prayer of the
Priest, or by the mystick words of <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi>
said ove the Elements? For, that by the force of those
words, said with right intention, the bread is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Sacr. Euchar. cap. 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> Est igitur.</note>
and made the body of Christ, <hi>Ecclesia
Catholica magno consensu docet,</hi> said <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> so it
is also in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> in the Instruction of
the Armenians;<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Sent. dist. 8.</note> so it is taught in the Catechism of the
Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> so it is agreed by the Master of the
Sentences and his Scholars; by <hi>Gratian,</hi> and the
Lawyers; and so it is determin'd in the law it self, <hi>Cap.
Cum Martha extr. de celebratione Missarum.</hi> And yet
this is no certain thing; and not so agreeable to the
spirituality of the Gospel, to suppose such a change
made by the saying so many words. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Church does well in using all the words of
Institution at the Consecration; for so they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
recited in the Liturgies of S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Clement,</hi>
S. <hi>Basil,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> the <hi>Anaphora</hi> of the
Syrians,<note place="margin">Inter Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listas quae omittuntur ab uno supplentur ab alio. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius de offic.</note> in the Universal Canon of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they do not do this so carefully in the <hi>Roman Missal,</hi>
but leave out words very considerable, words which
S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> recite; <hi>viz. which is broken for
you;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Missae l. 3. c. 17.</note> or <hi>which is given for you:</hi> and to the words of
Consecration of the Chalice, they add words which
Christ did not speak in the Institution and Benediction;
yet besides this generally the Greek Fathers, and divers
of the Latine, do expressly teach, that the Consecration
of the elements is made by the prayers of the Church,


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64671:149"/>
recited by the Bishop or Priest: For the Scripture tells
us, that Christ took the bread, he blessed it, and brake it,
and gave it to them, saying, Take, eat. It is to be supposed
that Christ consecrated it before he gave it to them;
and yet if he did, all the Consecration was effected by
his Benediction of it: And if (as the <hi>Romanists</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
Christ gave the Sacrament of the Eucharist to
the two Disciples at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> it is certain there is no
record of any other Consecration, but by Christs
blessing or praying over the elements. It is indeed
possible that something more might be done than was
set down, but nothing less; and therefore this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
was not done without the Benediction; and
therefore <hi>Hoc est corpus meum</hi> alone cannot do it; at
least there is no warrant for it in Christs Example.
And when S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Ministery did found and
establish Churches, <hi>Orationum ordinem quibus oblata
Deo sacrificia consecrantur à S. Petro primò fuisse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutum,</hi>
said <hi>Isidore, Remigius, Hugo de S. Victore,</hi> and
<hi>Alphonsus à Castro;</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> first instituted the order
of Prayers by which the sacrifices offer'd to God were
consecrated: and in the Liturgy of S. <hi>James,</hi> after the
words of Institution are recited over the Elements,
there is a Prayer of Consecration, <hi>O Lord, make this
Bread to be the body of thy Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Which words
although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> troubles himself to answer, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Bessarion</hi> did before him; yet we shall find his
answers to no purpose; expounding the prayer to be
onely a Confirmation, or an <hi>Amen</hi> to what was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for if that Consecration was made before that
Prayer, how comes S. <hi>James</hi> to call it Bread after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration?
And as weak are his other answers, saying,
The Prayer means that God would make it so to us,
not in it self: which although S. <hi>James</hi> hath nothing
to warrant that Exposition; yet it is true upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account, that is, because the Bread becomes Christs


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64671:150"/>
body onely to us, to them who communicate worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but never to the wicked, and it is not Christs body
but in the using it, and that worthily too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his third Answer (which he uses first) is certainly
the best; and that is the answer which <hi>Bessarion</hi> makes,
That, for ought they know, the order of the words is
chang'd; and that the Prayer should be set before,
not after the words of Consecration. Against which,
although it is sufficient to oppose, that, for ought they
or we know, the order is not chang'd; for to this day,
and always (so far as any record remains) the Greeks
kept the same order of the words; and the Greek
Fathers had their sentiment and doctrine agreeable to
it. And as in S. <hi>James</hi> his Liturgy, so in the <hi>Missal</hi> said
to be of S. <hi>Clement,</hi> the same order is observed; and
after the words of the Institution or Declaration, God
is invocated to send his Holy Spirit to make the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to become the body and bloud of Christ. And in
pursuance of this <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> calls it,<note place="margin">Apol. 2. lib. 8. cont. Celsum.</note>

account in other places: The use I make of it now, is
this; that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not onely forward to
decree things uncertain, or to take them for granted,
which they can never prove; but when she is by chance
or interest, or mistake faln upon a proposition, she will
not endure any one to oppose it; and indeed, if she did
suffer a change in this particular, not onely a great part
of their <hi>Thomistical</hi> Theology would be found out to
be sandy and inconsistent; but the whole doctrine of
Transubstantiation would have no foundation. True
it is, this is a new doctrine in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for
<hi>Amularius</hi> affirms that the Apostles did consecrate
onely by Benediction; and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third,


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64671:150"/>
and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, taught that Christ did
not consecrate by the words of <hi>Hoc est corpus meum:</hi>
so that the doctrine is new; and yet I make no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he that shall now say so, shall not be accounted a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
                  <p>But the instances are many of this nature, not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be enumerated, because they are notorious; and
when the <hi>Quaestiones disputatae,</hi> as S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>
calls a Volume of his Disputation, are (at least many of
them) past into Catholick propositions, and become
the general doctrine of their Church; they do not so
much insist upon the nature of the propositions, as the
securing of that authority by which they are taught.
If any man dissent in the doctrine of Purgatory, or
Concomitancy, and the half Communion, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<hi>Hannibal ad portas;</hi> they first kill him, and then
damne him (as far as they can.) But in the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
of Predetermination, in which mans duty, and the
force of laws, and the powers of choice, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God are deeply concerned, they differ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
and yet they endure the difference, and keep
the Communion. But if the heats and interests that are
amongst them had happened to be imployed in this
Instance; they would have made a dissent in these
questions as damnable as any other. But the events of
salvation and damnation (blessed be God) do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the votes and sentences of men, but upon
the price which God sets upon the propositions; and
it would be considered, that there are some propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in which men are confident and erre securely,
which yet have greater influence upon the honour of
God, or his dishonour, or upon good or bad life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively,
than many others, in which the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
make more noise, and have less consideration. For
these things they teach not, <hi>as the scribes, but as having
authority;</hi> not as <hi>Doctors</hi> but as <hi>Lawgivers;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64671:151"/>
Christ onely is, the Apostles by the assistance of
an infallible spirit did publish his Sanctions; but gave
no laws of faith, but declar'd what Christ had made
so; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> was careful to leave a note of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
with a. <hi>hoc dico ego, non Dominus:</hi> it follows
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does <hi>dominari fidei &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiis,</hi>
make her self mistress of faith and consciences:
which being the prerogative of God, it is part of his
glory that he will not impart unto another. But this
evil hath proceeded unto extremity, and armies have
been raised to prove their propositions; and vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of innocent persons have been put to the sword,
and burnt in the fire, and expos'd to horrible torments,
for denying any of their articles; and their Saints have
been their Ensign bearers, particularly S. <hi>Dominick;</hi> and
an office of torment and Inquisition is erected in their
most zealous Countries. <hi>Nempe hoc est esse Christianum,</hi>
this is the Roman manner of being Christian: And whom
they can, and whom they cannot kill they excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
and curse, and say, they are damned. This is
so contrary to the communion of Saints, and so express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the rule of the Apostle commanding us to
<hi>receive them that are weak in faith, but not to receive
them unto doubtful disputations;</hi> and so ruinous to the
grace of charity, which hopes and speaks the best, and
not absolutely the worst thing in the world; and so
directly oppos'd to Christs precept, which commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
us, <hi>not to judge, that we be not judged;</hi> and is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to publick peace, which is easily broken with them
whom they think to be damned wretches; and is so
forgetful of humane infirmity; and but little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that in so innumerable a company of old and new
propositions, it is great odds but themselves are or may
be deceiv'd; and lastly, it is so much against the very
law of nature, which ever permits the Understanding
free, though neither tongue nor hand; and leaves all


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64671:151"/>
that to the Divine Judgement, which ought neither
to be invaded nor antedated; that this evil doctrine
and practice is not more easily reproved than it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and intolerable, and of all things in the world
the most unlike the spirit of a Christian. I know that
against this they have no answer to oppose, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate;
and say that we in the Church of <hi>England</hi> do
so; and hang their priests, and punish by fines and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
their lay Proselytes. To which the answer
need not be long, or to trouble the order of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
For 1. we put none of their Laity to death
for their opinion; which shews that it is not the
Religion is persecuted, but some other evil appendix.
2. We do not put any of their Priests to death who is
not a native of the Kingdoms; but those subjects who
pass over hence, and receive orders abroad, and return
with evil errands. 3. Neither were these so treated,
until by the Pope our Princes were excommunicated,
and the Subjects absolved from their duty to them,
and incouraged to take up arms against them; and
that the English Priests return'd with traiterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
and that many conspiracies were discover'd.
4. And <hi>lastly,</hi> when much of the evil and just causes
of fear did cease, the severity of procedure is taken
off, and they have more liberty than hitherto they have
deserv'd. Now if any of these things can be said by
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her defence, I am content she
shall enjoy the benefit of her justification. For her rage
extends to all, Laity as well as Clergy; forreign Clergy
as well as Domestick, their own people and strangers,
the open dissentients and the secretly suspected; those
that are delated and those whom they can inquire of;
and own that, which we disavow; and which if we did
do, we should be reproved by our own sentences and
publick profession to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But now after all this, if it shall appear that the


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64671:152"/>
danger is on the part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and safety
on our side, and yet that we in our censure of their
doctrines are not so fierce, and in our fears of their final
condition not so decretory and rash; then this doctrine
of theirs against us, is both the more uncharitable, and
the more unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infinitely confident
they are in the right I easily believe, because they say
they are; and they have causes but too many to create,
or to occasion that confidence in them: for they never
will consider concerning any of their Articles; their
unlearned men not at all, their learned men only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their own, and to confute their adversaries, whose
arguments though never so convincing, they are bound
to look upon as temptations, and to use them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
which thing (in case they can be in an error)
may prove so like the sin against the Holy Ghost, as Milk
is to Milk; if at least all conviction of error; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of truth, be the effect and grace of the
Spirit of God: which ought very warily to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
                  <p>But this confidence is no argument of truth: for
they telling their people, that they are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all that they teach with an assent, not equal to
their proof of it, but much greater, even the greatest
that can be; they tie them to believe it without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or proof: for to believe more strongly than the
argument inferrs, is to believe something without the
argument; or at least to have some portions of Faith,
which relies upon no argument; which if it be not
effected by a supreme, and more infallible principle,
can never be reasonable: but this they supply with
telling them, that they cannot erre; and this very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
it self, needing another supply (for why shall
they believe this, more than any thing else, with an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
greater than can be effected by their argument?)


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64671:152"/>
they supply this also, with affrighting Homilies and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of damnation. So that it is no wonder, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> people are so confident; since it is not upon the
strength of their argument, or cause (for they are
taught to be confident beyond that) but it is upon the
strength of passion, credulity, interest and fear, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and pretended authority: all which, As, we hope
God will consider in passing his unerring sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the poor mis-led people of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
So, we also, considering their infirmity and our
own, dare not enter into the secret of God's judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning all, or any of their persons; but pray
for them, and offer to instruct them; we reprove their
false doctrines, and use means to recall them from
darkness, into some more light than there they see; but
we pass no further; and we hope that this charity and
modesty will not, (we are sure it ought not) be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our reproach, for this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that
toleration of our erring Brethren,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> and long sufferance,
which we have learn'd from God, and it ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Repentance in them; and yet if it does not, we
do but our duty, always remembring the words of the
Great Apostle which he spake to the Church of <hi>Rome,
Thou art inexcusable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>O man, whosoever thou art, that
judgest another; for in what thou judgest another, thou
condemnest thy self;</hi> and we fear, and every man is
bound to do so too, lest the same measure of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we make to the errors of our Brother, be heap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d
up against our own, in case we fall into any. And the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should do well to consider this; for
she is not the less likely to erre, but much more for
thinking she cannot erre; her very thinking and saying
this thing, being her most Capital error, as I shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
endeavour to make apparent. I remember
that <hi>Paganinus Gaudentius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, tells
that <hi>Theódore Beza,</hi> being old, and coming into the


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64671:153"/>
Camp of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> was ask'd by some
Whether he were sure that he followed the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
He modestly answer'd, That he did daily pray
to God, to direct him with his holy Spirit, and to give
him a light from Heaven to guide him. Upon which
answer, because they expounded it to be in <hi>Beza,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
and irresolution, he says that may who
heard him, took that hint, and became <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.
It is strange it should be so, that one man's
modesty should make another man bold; and that the
looking upon a sound eye, should make another sore.
But so it is; that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> very ill use
is made of our charity and modesty. However, I shall
give a true account of the whole affair as it stands,
and then leave it to be consider'd.</p>

with any such judgment) call damnable. As for
example; to <hi>add any thing to Scriptures, or to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into the Faith, any thing that is not written;</hi> or
to call any <hi>thing Divine, that is not in the authority of


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64671:153"/>
the Holy Scriptures;</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> says, <hi>whosoever
does may fear the woe pronounc'd in Scripture against
adders and detracters;</hi> and S. <hi>Basil</hi> says, is <hi>a manifest
note of infidelity, and a most certain sign of pride;</hi> and
others add, it <hi>is an evil heart of immodesty, and most
vehemently forbidden by the Apostles.</hi> Against the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
then brought, some little cavils were made,
and many evil words of railing publish'd, which I have
not only washt off in the second Section of this Second
part, but have, to my thinking, clearly prov'd them
guilty of doing ill in this question, and receding from
the rule of the primitive Church; and have added
many other testimonies concerning the main Inquiry,
to which the weak answers offer'd can no way be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and to which the more learned answers of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
and <hi>Perron,</hi> are found insufficient; as it there
is made to appear. So that I know nothing remains
to them to be considered, but Whether or no, the
primitive, and holy Fathers, were too zealous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
this doctrine and practice of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church too severely? We are sure the thing which
the Fathers so condemn, is done without warrant,
and contrary to all authentick precedents of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and holiest Ages of the Church, and greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the dignity and fulness of Scripture; and
infinitely dangerous to the Church for the intromitting
the doctrines of men into the Canon of Faith, and a
great diminution to the reputation of that providence,
by which it is certain, the Church was to be secur'd in
the Records of Salvation; which could not be done
by any thing so well, as by writing what was to be kept
inviolate; especially in the propositions of Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
oftentimes upon a word, and a phrase, and a
manner of expression; which in the infinite variety of
reporters, might too easily suffer change. Thus far we
can safely argue concerning the error of the Church of


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64671:154"/>
                     <hi>Rome;</hi> and to this not we, but the Fathers, add a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Censure. And when some of these censures were
set down by way of <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>warning,</hi> not of <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>final sentence;</hi> it seems a wonder to me how
these Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion,<note place="margin">Letter, <hi>and</hi> Truth will out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> that
wrote against the Book, should recite all these terrible
sayings out of the Fathers against their superaddition
of Articles to the Faith contain'd in Scriptures, and be
so little concerned as to read them with a purpose
only to find fault with the quotations, and never
be smitten with a terror of the judgment which the
Fathers pronounce against them that do so. Just as if a
man being ready to perish in a storm, should look up
and down the ship to see if the little paintings were
exact; or as if a man in a terrible clap of thunder
should consider whether he ever heard so unmusical a
sound, and never regard his own danger. 2. The
same is the case in their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, worshipping of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Bread: in which, if they be not deceiv'd; all
the reason, and all the senses of all the men in the world
are deceiv'd; and if they be deceiv'd, then it is certain,
they give Divine worship to what they naturally eat
and drink; and how great a provocation of God that
is, they cannot but know by the whole analogy of
the Old and New Testament, and even by natural reason
it self, and all the dictates of Religion which God hath
written in our hearts. On the other side, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that if the Divine worship they intend to Christ
were pass'd immediately to him sitting in Heaven, and
not thorow that blessed thing upon the Altar, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and primarily to him whose passion there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
and the benefits of whose death are there
offer'd and exhibited; there could be no diminution
of any right due to Christ. Nay to them who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that in the first institution and tradition of it to the
Apostles, Christ's body was still whole and unkroken,


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64671:154"/>
and separate from the Bread, and could not then be
transubstantiate and pass from it self into what it was
not before, and yet remain still it self what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and that neither Christ did command the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to worship, neither did they worship any thing
but God the Father, at that time; it must needs seem
to be a prodigious venture of their souls, to change
that action, into a needless, and ungrounded supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
especially since after Christ's ascension, his body
is not only in <hi>Heaven, which must contain it until his
coming to judgment;</hi> but is so chang'd, so immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
or spiritual, that it is not capable of being broken
by hands or teeth. In not adoring that which we see
to be Bread, we can be as safe as the Apostles were,
who, (that we find) did not worship it; but in giving
Divine honours to it, we can be no more safe (in case
their proposition be amiss) than he that worships the
Sun, because he verily believes he is the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
A good meaning in this case will not justifie his
action; not only because he hath enough to instruct
him better, and to bring him to better understanding,
but especially because he may mean as well, if he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Christ in Heaven, <hi>Ad sua templa oculis, animo ad
sua numina spectans;</hi> yea, and better, when he does
actually worship Christ at that time, directing the
worship to him in Heaven, and would terminate his
worship on the Host, if he were sure it were Christ, or
were commanded so to do. Add to this, that <hi>to worship
Christ</hi> is an <hi>affirmative praecept,</hi> and, so it be done in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and holiness, and love, in all just ways of address
to him, in praying to him, reciting his prayers, giving
him thanks, trusting in him, hoping in him, and loving
him with the best love of obedience: not to bow the
knee, <hi>hîc &amp; nunc</hi> when we fear to displease him by so
doing, cannot be a sin, because for that <hi>hîc &amp; nunc</hi>
there is no commandement at all. And after all; if


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64671:155"/>
we will suppose that the doctrine of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were true; yet because the Priest that consecrates
may indeed secretly have receiv'd invalid Orders, or
have evil Intention, or there may be some undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
nullity in the whole Oeconomy and ministration;
so that no man of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion can say, that
by Divine faith he believes that this Host is at this time
transubstantiated; but onely hath conjectures and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
suppositions, that it is so, and that he does not
certainly know the contrary. He that certainly gives
Divine Honour to that which is not certain to be the
Body of Christ, runs into a danger too great, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to himself he shall be safe. Some there are who
go further yet, and consider that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
say onely, that the bread is chang'd into the body of
Christ, but not into his soul; for then the same bread
would be at the same time both material and immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
and that if it were, that to give honours abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Divine to the humanity of Christ, abstracted
from consideration of his Divinity, into which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the bread is not transubstantiated, is too neer the
doctrine of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who suppose the humanity
to be absolutely Deified; and Divine Honours to be
due to Christ as a man whom God hath exalted above
every name. But if they say, that they worship the
body in concretion with the Divinity; it is certain that
may be done at all times by looking up to heaven in
all our religious addresses. And therefore that is the
safe way, and that's the way of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
The other way, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at the best
is full of dangers, and <hi>qui amat periculum peribit in
illo,</hi> was the wise mans caution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The like to this is the Practice of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> in worshipping Angels; which as it is no where
commanded in the New Testament, so it is expressly
forbidden by an Angel himself twice,<note place="margin">Revel. 22.</note> to S. <hi>John,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64671:155"/>
an unalterable reason; <hi>for I am thy fellow-servant,
worship God;</hi> or as some Ancient Copies read it, <hi>worship
Jesus:</hi> meaning that, although in the Old Testament
the Patriarchs and Prophets did bow before the Angels
that appear'd to them as God's Embassadors, and in the
Person of God; and to which they were greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
because their law was given by Angels: yet
when God had exalted the Son of Man to be <hi>the Lord
of Men and Angels,</hi> we are all fellow-servants; and
they are not to receive religious worship as before,
nor we to pay it them. And by this we understand the
reproof which S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes of the Gnosticks,<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> of whose
practice he forewarns the Christians that they suffer not
themselves to be deceiv'd by <hi>the worshipping of Angels.</hi>
Now by these authorities it is plain, that it can at
least be no duty to worship Angels; and therefore
they that do it not, cannot be blamed: but if these
words mean here, as they do in all other places,
there is at least great danger to do it.</p>
                  <p>4 And of the like danger is Invocation of Saints; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
which if it be no more than a meer desire to them to
pray for us, why is it express'd in their publick Offices
in words that differ not from our Prayers to God? if it
be more, it creates in us, or is apt to create in us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the creatures; it relies upon that which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> us'd as an argument against worship of Angels,
and that is, <hi>intruding into those things we understand
not;</hi> for it pretends to know their present state, which
is hid from our eyes; and it proceeds upon the very
reason upon which the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians</hi>
went; that is, that it is fit to have mediators between
God and us: that we may present our prayers to them,
and they to God. To which adde, that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> presenting Candles and other Donaries to the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as to the Queen of Heaven, do that which
the <hi>Collyridians</hi> did; the gift is only differing, as Candle


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64671:156"/>
and Cake, Gold and Garments, this vow or that vow.
All which being put together makes a dangerous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;
not like to the Worship and Devotion us'd in
the Primitive Church, but so like to what is forbidden
in Scripture, that it is much the worse. The advantage
got by these things cannot countervail the evil of the
suspicion; and the wit of them that do so, cannot by
a secure answer escape the force of a prohibition; and
therefore it were infinitely more safe to let it alone;
and to invocate and adore him only who is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,

souls of Christians? What glory is done to God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
represented in little shapes, and humane or phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
figures? What Scripture did ever command it?
what prophet did not reprove it? Is it not in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and grammatical and proper understanding
of words, forbidden by an express Commandment of
God? Is there any duty incumbent on us to do it?
Certainly, all the arts of witty men of the <hi>Roman</hi> side,
are little enough, and much too little to prove, that it
is lawful to make and worship them: and the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and elusions, the tricks and artifices are so many,
that it is a great piece of impertinent learning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them, and no small trouble to understand
them; and they that most need the distinctions (that is,
the common people) cannot use them; and at the best,
it is very hard to think it lawful, but very easie to
understand that it is forbidden; and most easie to be
assur'd it is very innocent to let it alone. <hi>Where an
image is, there is no religion,</hi> said <hi>Lactantius;</hi> and <hi>we
ought rather to die than to pollute our faith with such
impieties,</hi> said <hi>Origen.</hi> Now let us suppose that these
fathers speak against the heathen superstition of


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64671:156"/>
worshipping the images of their
gods;<note place="margin">Against these quotations us'd in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the first Part, the Author of the <hi>Letter to a friend,</hi> page 3. And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Truth will out,</hi> page 6. object that these Fathers speak against the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the images of heathen gods, not of the use of images amongst Christians: which cavil the Reader may see largely refuted in the Sect. <hi>Of Images.</hi>
                     </note> certainly, if it was a fault
in them, it is worse in Christians,
who have received so many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to the contrary, and who
are tied <hi>to worship the Father in
spirit and in truth,</hi> and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
permitted to worship him by an image. And
true it is, that images are more fit for false gods, than
for the true God, the Father of Spirits; the supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of images is more proportion'd to the Idolatry of
false gods, than to true religion and the worship of
him <hi>whom eye hath not seen,</hi> and cannot see, nor heart
can comprehend. And it is a vain Elusion to say, that
these Fathers did not severely censure the use of images
among Christians; for all that time among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
there was no use of images at all in religion; and
for the very reasons by which they condemn'd the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
superstition of image-worship, for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they would never endure it at all amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
But then if this be so highly criminal (as these
Ancient Fathers say) I desire it may be consider'd, for
what pretended reasons the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should not
onely permit, but allow, and decree, and urge the use
of images in their religious adorations? If it be onely
for instruction of the Laity, that might be better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by Catechisings, and frequent Homilies; and if
instruction be intended, then the single Statues are less
useful; but Histories and Hieroglyphicks are to be
painted upon Tables; and in them I suppose there
would be less temptation of doing abomination. But
when the images simple or mixt are painted or carved,
the people must be told what their meaning is; and
then they will not need such books, who may with less
danger learn their lesson by heart: and besides this,
they are told strange stories of the Saints whose images


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64671:157"/>
they see, and of the images themselves that represent
the Saints; and then it may be these Lay-mens books
may teach them things that they must unlearn again.
But yet if they be useful for instruction, what benefit
is done to our spirits by giving them adoration? That
God will accept it as an honour done to himself, he
hath no where told us; and he seems often to have
told us the contrary; and if it be possible by mans wit
to acquit this practice from being (what the prophets
so highly reprove) <hi>spiritual whoredom,</hi> in giving Gods
due to an image; yet it can never be prov'd to be a
part of that worshipping of God in spirit and in truth
which he requires. And though it would never have
been believed in <hi>Origen</hi>'s, <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s, or <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s
days, that ever there would arise a sort of Christians
that should contend earnestly for the worshipping
images, or that ever the heathen way of worship, <hi>viz.</hi>
of what they call'd God, by an image, should become
a great part of Christianity, or that a Council of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
should decree the worship of images, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of faith; or that they should think men should
be damned for denying worship to images; yet after
all this, when it is considered that the worshipping of
images by Christians is so great a scandal to the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that they think themselves justified in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by this; and so great a scandal to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi>
that they hate Christianity it self for that very reason;
it is a strange pertinacy in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to retain
this practice for so little pretensions of good, and with
so evident a mischief: To which, if this be added, that
many of the ruder people do down-right worship the
image without a distinction, or scruple, or difference;
and that for ought we know, many souls perish by such
practices, which might be secur'd by the taking away
the images and forbidding the superstition: I for
my part cannot imagine how the Guides of souls


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64671:157"/>
can answer it to God, or satisfie their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their so vilely and cheaply regarding Souls,
and permitting them to live in danger, and die in
sin, for no spiritual good which can accrue to the
Church, which can countervail the danger, much less
the loss of one Soul. However, it will be very hard
from any principle of Christian Religion, to prove it is
a damnable sin, not to worship Images; but every man
that can read, hath very much to say, that to worship
them, is a provocation of God to anger, and to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie.</p>
                  <p>6. Thus also it must needs be confessed, that it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
more safe for the Church of God, to give the Holy
Communion in both kinds then but in one; and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>'s
foolish reason of the Wine sticking to lay
mens Beards, is as ridiculous, as the doctrine it self is
unreasonable; and if they would shave Lay-mens
Beards, as they do the Clergy, it would be less incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
than what they now feel; and if there be no
help for it, they had better lose their Beards, than lose
their share of the Bloud of Christ. And what need is
there to dispute such uncertain and unreasonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
as that Christ's Bloud is with the Body, by
way of <hi>Concomitancy,</hi> as if the Sacrament were not of
Christ's Body broken, and the Bloud poured out; and
as if, in case it be so, Christ did not know, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it, but, for all that, instituted the Supper in both
kinds. And what more is gotten by the Host alone,
than by that and the Chalice too? And what can be
answered to the pious desires of so many Nations, to
have the Chalice restored; when they ask for nothing
but their part of the Legacy which Christ left them in
his Testament? And the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which takes
upon her to be sole Executrix, or at least, Overseer
of it, tells them, that the Legacy will do them no
good; and keeps it from them, by telling them, It is


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64671:158"/>
not necessary, nay, it is worse than so; for when in the
time of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> instance was made, that
leave might be given to such as desire it; the Oracle
was utter'd by the Cardinal of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. Trident. lib. 5. A. D. 1561. Sub Pio Qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

given after the old manner, so that no man was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For no man was capable of receiving the favour
but he that profess'd he did not believe it necessary;
and then there could be no great reason to desire it:
He that thought he needed it, could not receive it;
and he that found no want of it, in all reason would
not be importunate for it, and then he should be sure
not to have it: So that, in effect, there were two sorts
of persons denyed it; Those that required it, and those
that did not require it. And to what Christian grace
to referre the wisdom and piety of this answer, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yet learn. Neither can I yet imagine why the
Cardinal S. <hi>Angelo</hi> should call <hi>Giving the Cup to the

                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>a giving them a Cup of deadly poyson;</hi> since cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that the Bloud of Christ is <hi>a savour of life,</hi> and
not of death; and, as the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour replied,
<q>The Apostles who did give it, were not impoysoners;
and the many ages of the primitive Church did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it with very great emolument and spiritual
comfort.</q> To this I know it will be said by some,
who cannot much defend their Church in the thing it
self, That it is no great matter; and if all things else
were accorded, this might be dispens'd withall; and
the Pope could give leave to the respective Churches,
to have according as it might be expedient, and fit for
edification. But this will not serve the turn: For first
the thing it self, is no small matter, but of greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.
It is the Sacramental Bloud of Christ. The
Holy Bread cannot be the Sacrament of the Bloud; and
if Christ did not esteem it as necessary, to leave a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Bloud, as of his Body, he would not have
done it; and if he did think it as necessary, certainly it


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64671:158"/>
was so. But 2. Suppose the matter be small; why
then shall a Schism be made by him that would be
thought the Great Father of Christians? and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
almost displeas'd and offended, rather than he
will comply with their desires of having nothing but
what Christ left them? If the thing be but little, why
do they take a course to make it (as they suppose)
damnation to desire it? And if it be said, Because it is
Heresie, to think the Church hath erred all this while
in denying it; to this, the answer will be easie, that
themselves who did deny it, have given the occasion,
and not they who do desire it; neither have all the
Christian Churches denyed it; for I think none but
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does; and if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church by
granting it now to her own Children, will be suppos'd
to have erred in denying it; to continue this denial,
will not cure that inconvenience: for that which at first
was but an Error, will now become Heresie, if they be
pertinacious in the refusal. But if it were not for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical,
and humane considerations, and secular interests,
there will be little question, but that it will be safer,
and more agreeable to Christ's institution, and the
Apostolical doctrine, and the primitive practice, to grant
it lovingly, than to detain it sacrilegiously: For at
least, the detention will look like Sacrilege; and the
granting it, cannot but be a Fatherly, and pious ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
especially since when it is granted, all parties are
pleased, and no man's authority real, or pretended, is
questioned. But whatever become of this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is nothing but a charitable desire, and way
of peace with our adversaries, and a desire to win them
by our not intermedling with their unalterable, and
pertinacious interest; yet as to the thing it self, it is
certain, that to communicate in both kinds, is justifiable
by the institution of Christ, and the perpetual practice
of the Church for many ages; which thing certainly is,


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64671:159"/>
or ought to be, the greatest Rule for the Churches imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had this advantage
against us in any Article, as I hope there would not be
found so much pertinacy amongst us, as to resist the
power of such an argument; so it is certain there would
not be amongst them so much modesty as to abstain
from the most absolute triumph, and the fiercest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations:
In the mean time, our safety in this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
also is visible and notorious. Against the saying of
Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which in the Preface to the first part I
brought to reprove this practice; those who thought
themselves oblig'd to object, will find the quotation
justified in the Section of the Half-Communion; to

could not be, that they were not baptized; and to
amerce their no-fault with so great a fine, even the
loss of all the good which they could receive from him
that created them, and loves them, is such a playing
with Heads, and a regardless treatment of Souls, that
for charity sake, and common humanity, we dare not
mingle in their Counsels. But if we erre, it is on the
safer side; it is on the one side of mercy and charity.
These seven particulars are not trifling considerations;
but as they have great influence into the event of
Souls, so they are great parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion,


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64671:159"/>
as they have pleased to order Religion at this day. I
might instance in many more, if I thought it necessary,
or did not fear they would think me inquisitive for
objections: therefore I shall add no more; only I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
my self to wonder at the obstinacy of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Prelates, that will not consent, that the Liturgy of
their Church should be understood by the people.
They have some pretence of politick reason, why they
forbid the translation of the Scriptures; though all
wise men know they have other reasons, than what
they pretend, yet this also would be considered; that
if the people did read the Scriptures, and would use
that liberty well, they might receive infinite benefit by
them; and that if they did abuse that liberty, it were
the Peoples fault, and not the Rulers; but that they are
forbidden, that is the Rulers fault, and not the Peoples:
But for prohibiting the understanding of their publick,
and sometimes of many of their private devotions,
there can be no plausible pretence, no excuse of policy,
no end of piety; and if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be not
in this also, of the surer side, then we know nothing,
but all the reason of all man-kind is faln asleep.</p>
                  <p>Well, however these things have at least, very much
probability in them; yet for professing these things
according to the Scriptures, and Catholick tradition, and
right Reason (as will be further demonstrated in the

                     </gap>, <hi>a vain worship.</hi> Now this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
it self in two degrees; The first was in over-valuing
humane ordinances; that is, equalling them
to Divine Commandments; exacting them by the same
measures, by which they require obedience to God's
laws, and this with a pretended zeal for God's honour
and service. Thus the Pharisees were noted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by our Blessed Saviour.</p>
                  <p>1. The things of decency, or indifferent practices,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
were counselled by their Forefathers; in process of
time they became approved by use and Custom; and
then their Doctors denied their Communion to them
that omitted them, found out new reasons for them,
were severe in their censures concerning the causes of
their omission, would approve none, no not the cases
and exceptions of charity or piety. And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd
in their washings of cups and platters, and the
outside of dishes; which either was at first instituted
for cleanliness and decency, or else as being symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
to the Purifications in the Law: but they chang'd
the Scene, enjoyn'd it as necessity; were scandalized
at them that us'd it not; practis'd it with a frequency,
passing into an intolerable burden; insomuch that at
the marriage of Cana in Galilee there were six water-Pots
set after the manner of the Purification of the
Jews; because they washed often in the time of their
meals; and then they put new reasons, and did it for
other causes than were in the first institution. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
these washings might have been used without
violation of any Commandment of God; yet even by
this Tradition they made Gods Commandment void, by
making this necessary, and imposing these useless and
unnecessary burdens on their brethren, by making snares
for Consciences, and making Religion and the Service
of God to consist in things indifferent. So they made


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64671:161"/>
void Gods Commandment by turning Religion into su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Whereas humane laws, customs and traditions
may oblige in publick, and for order sake, and decency,
and for reputation and avoiding scandal, and to give
testimony of obedience; and are not violated if they
be omitted without scandal and contempt, and injury,
with a probable reason: yet to think they oblige
beyond what man can see, or judge, or punish, or feel,
is to give to humane laws the estimate which is due
to divine laws. So did the Pharisees: <hi>Quicquid sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes
vetant palàm fieri, id etiam in penetralibus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titum
est,</hi> said Rabbi <hi>Bachai.</hi> But this is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Divine Laws which oblige as much in private
as in publick; because God equally sees in the Closet
and in the Temple: Men cannot do this, and therefore
cannot make Laws to bind, where they can have no
cognisance and no concern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Humane authority is to command according to
its own rate; that is, at the rate of humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
where the obedience may be possibly defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
because the understanding is fallible. But the
Divine authority is infallible, and absolute, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme:
and therefore our obedience to it must be
as absolute, perpetual, and indeficient. But the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
had a saying, and their practice was accordingly;
<hi>Si dixerint scribae dextram esse sinistram, &amp; sinistram
esse dextram, audi eos,</hi> said the forenamed <hi>Rabbi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The second degree in which this express'd it self
among the Pharisees, was, that they did not onely
equal, but preferr'd the Commandments of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Commands of God. <hi>Plus est in verbis scriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
quam in verbis legis</hi>

                        </gap>h, &amp;c.</note>; and of this the instance
that our Blessed Saviour gives is in the case of the
<hi>Corban,</hi> and not relieving their Parents. <hi>Sacrum erit


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64671:161"/>

said it was dedicated; their Father's hungry belly might
not be relieved by it. And this our Blessed Saviour
calls, as being the highest degree of this superstition, <hi>a
making the Commandment of God of no effect by their

necessary and unavoidable consequence.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is greatly guilty of

                  <p>1. I First instance in their <hi>Seal of Confession;</hi> And
the question is not, Whether a Priest is to take
care of his Penitent's fame, or whether he be
not in all prudent and pious ways to be careful, lest he

whether the Seal of Confession be so sacred and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
that it is not to be opened in the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
danger of a King, or Kingdom; or for the doing
the greatest good, or avoiding the greatest evil in the
world: that's now the question, and such a Broad
Seal as this, is no part of the Christian Religion, was
never spoken of by the Prophets or Apostles, in the
Old or the New Testament, never was so much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd

1. That it was in the power of the Confessor, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the publication of certain crimes, 2. That though
it was not lightly to be done, yet upon great reason it
might. 3. That the spiritual good of the penitent,
and the edification of others, were causes sufficient for
the publication. 4. That of these; the Confessor was


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64671:163"/>
judge. 5. That this was no otherwise done by the
consent of the party, but because he was bound to
consent when the Confessor enjoyn'd it: And the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is evident, in the case of the incestuous <hi>Corinthian;</hi>
who either was restor'd without private Confession;
or, if he was not, S. <hi>Paul</hi> caus'd it to be publish'd in the
Church, and submitted the man to the severest disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and yet publick, that was then or since in the
world. The like to this, we find in a decretal Epistle
of Pope <hi>Leo;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epist. 80. ad Epist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae.</note> for when some Confessors, exceeding the
ancient Ecclesiastical Rule, were not so prudent and
deliberate in conducting their Penitents, as formerly
they were, but commanded that all their whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
should be written down, and publickly read;
he says, <hi>Though the plentitude of Faith might be lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
that is not afraid to blush in publick, yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is sufficient, if it be made in secret</hi> first to God,
and then to the Priest: and adds, <hi>Non omnium hujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi
sunt peccata, ut ea quae poenitentiam poscunt, non
timeant publicare;</hi> All sins are not of that nature, that
are fit to be publish'd: and therefore <hi>removeatur tam
improbabilis consuetudo;</hi> let such a reprovable custome
be taken away.] In which words of S. <hi>Leo;</hi> we find,
1. That the Seal of Confession (as at this day it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
at <hi>Rome,)</hi> was no such inviolable, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
secret; for by a contrary custom it was too much
broken. 2. That he blames not the publication of
some sins, but that they indiscriminately did publish
all. 3. That the nature of some sins did not permit
it: for (as he adds afterwards) men by this means
were betrayed to the malice of their Enemies, who
would bring them before tribunals, in some cases.
4. That this was not spoken in case of publick Crimes,
delated, and brought into publick notice, but such as
were spoken in private Confession. And here I cannot
but desire, there had been some more ingenuity in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>


                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:64671:163"/>
who relating to this Epistle of S.<note place="margin">De poenitentiâ lib. 3. cap. 14. Sect. Denique cum secreta.</note> 
                     <hi>Leo,</hi> affirms,
that S. <hi>Leo</hi> says, It is against the Apostolical Rule, to
reveal secret sins, declar'd in Confession; when it is
plain, that S. <hi>Leo</hi> only blames the Custom of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all; saying, that all sins are not of that nature, as
to be fit to be reveal'd. And by these precedent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
we shall the easier understand that famous
fact of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> who abolished the Custom of having
sins published in the Church, and therefore took away
the penitentiary Priest, whose Office was (as I prov'd
out of <hi>Origen, Sozomen,</hi> and <hi>Burchard)</hi> to enjoyn
the publication of some sins, according to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
It hapned in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that a foul fact
was committed, and it was published in the ears of
the people, and a tumult was rais'd about it; and the
Remedy was, that <hi>Nectarius</hi> took away the Office, and
the Custom together. <hi>Consulentibus quibusdam ut
Vnicuique liberum permitteret, prout sibi ipse conscius
esset &amp; consideret, ad mysteriorum Communionem ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere,
poenitentiarium illum presbyterum exauthoravit.</hi>
Every man was thenceforth left to his liberty, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the dictate and confidence of his own conscience,
to come to the Communion; and this afterwards
pass'd into a Rite: for the manners of men growing
degenerate, and worse sins being now confess'd than
(as he supposes) formerly they had been; the judges
having been more severe, and the people more modest,
it was fit enough that this Custom, upon the occasion
of such a scandal, and so much mischief like to follow
it, should be laid aside wholly; and so it was. Here is
a plain story, truly told by <hi>Sozomen,</hi> and the matter is
easie to be understood. But <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> seeing the
practice, and doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pinch'd
by it, makes a distinction (deriv'd from the present
Custom of his Church) of publick Confession and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
saying, That <hi>Nectarius</hi> took away the publick,


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64671:164"/>
and not the private. This I shall have occasion to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss
in the next Section. I am now onely to speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Seal of Confession; which from this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is apparent was not such a sacred thing, but that
it was made wholly to minister to the publick and
private edification of the penitent, and the whole
Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus this Affair stood in the Primitive Church. In
descending ages when private Confessions grew fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and were converted into a Sacrament; the Seal
also was made more tenacious; and yet by the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church, there were divers Cases in
which the Seal might be broken up. 1. There is a
famous Gloss <hi>in Cap. Tua nos. lib. 4. Decretal. tit. 1. De
Sponsalibus &amp; Matrimonio;</hi> where the Pope answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a question concerning a pretended contract of
marriage, says, that the marriage is good, unless the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Bishop of <hi>Brescia</hi> could have assur'd him, that
the man did never consent, or intend the marriage,
<hi>Quod qualiter tibi constiterit, non videmus:</hi> The
Gloss upon these words says, <hi>Imò benè potuit constare;
quia vir ille hoc ei confitebatur,</hi> 
                     <q>The Bishop might
well know it, because the man had confessed it to
him; or because he had revealed it to him in peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
confession. For though in Judicial confession
before a tribunal no man is to be believed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of a third person, yet in penitential Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he is to be believ'd; because it is not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that he then is unmindful of his salvation.]</q>
Where the Gloss observing that he did or might have
received it in Confession, and yet make use of it in
Consultation with his superiors, and upon that answer
was to pronounce it to be, or not to be, a marriage,
and to treat the persons accordingly; it follows that
the thing it self might be revealed for the good of the
penitents soul, and this was done by the Cardinal of

and so great mischief. 2. And that Confession may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

marriage, is the opinion of many great Canonists.
3. That it may be revealed in the case of Heresie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
I think there was no doubt of it at any time.
4. And that every Confessor may reveal the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
by the Penitent's leave, is taught by <hi>Durandus,
Almain, Medina,</hi> and <hi>Navar;</hi> and generally by all the
ancient Scholars of S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> Now if a law be made
that in certain cases, the Confessor shall publish the
Confession, then every mans consent is involved in it,
as his private right is in the publick interest; of which
it is a part, and to which it is subordinate and must
yield. But who pleases to see how this affair once
did stand in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and more especially
in the Catholick Church, if he be not yet, may be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the proofs which <hi>Altisiodorensis</hi> gives of the
lawfulness of publishing Confessions in certain cases.
5. Lastly, if a sinful intention of committing a grievous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

then that the Seal of Confession may be broken open, is

<hi>Rome</hi> at this day, and hath been this last age for the


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64671:165"/>
most part; we shall find that this humane constitution,
relying upon prudent and pious considerations, is urged
as a Sacramental Obligation, and a great part of the
Religion; and is not accounted obliging onely for the
reasons of its first Sanction; nor as an act of obedience
to the positive law, but as a Natural, Essential, Divine
and unalterable Obligation. And from thence these
doctrines are derived. 1. That what a Priest knows in
Confession, he knows it not as a man, but as God: which
proposition (as it is foolish, and too neer to blasphemy,
and may as well inferr, that the Priest may be then
ador'd by the penitent with the distinction, <hi>viz.</hi> not
as man, but as God; so) is expressly confuted by the
Gloss above-cited,<note place="margin">In quartum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum sent. dist. 21.</note> and by <hi>Scotus;</hi> but taught by the
Modern Casuists, and is the ground of a strange practice.
For 2. as a consequent of the former, it is taught in
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by their greatest Guides, that if

may also swear, that he said nothing, or no such
thing in Confession. But how this should be excus'd,
or whether they think the Penitent to have spoken to
none but God; I am not yet satisfied. 3. It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

onely in case of Confession clear and express, but if it

that leave is to be express, and is not to be ask'd but
in the case of a compelling necessity; neither can the
Confessor impose a publick penance upon him, who
hath confessed privately. Which things, especially the

then let it be consider'd how cheap are the lives of
Kings in their eyes, who consult more with the safety
of a Villain, whom they dare not absolve<note n="*" place="margin">Script. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netti apud Is. Casaub ni Epist. ad Fron. Du caeum, p. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King, who is worthy ten thousands of his people; and
let it be also considered, that by using all the ways in
the world to make Confession easie to Traitors and
Homicides, they make it odious to Kings and Princes,
and to all that love the safety of their Sovereigns, and
of the publick. We find that the laws of God yield to
charity and necessity, and Christ followed the act of
<hi>David;</hi> who, <hi>when he was hungry, eat the Shew-bread,
which was unlawful to be eaten but by the Priest alone:</hi>
and he that commanded us to go, and learn what that
means, <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice,</hi> intended not
that the Seal of Confession should upon pretence of
Religion be us'd to the most uncharitable ends in the
world; no, though it had been made sacred by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Commandment; which it is not, but is wholly
introduc'd by Custom and Canons Ecclesiastical: And
when we see that things dedicated to God, and made
sacred by Religion, and the laws of God confirming
such Religion, can be alien'd and made common in
cases of extreme necessity, or great charity; it is a
strange superstition, that shall hold that fast with teeth
and nails, and never let it go, no not to save a soul, not
to preserve the life of Kings, not to prevent the greatest

                  <p>THat Confession to a Priest, is a Doctrine taught
as necessary in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is without
all question; and yet that it is but the Commandment
of men, I shall (I hope) clearly enough evince; and
if I do, I suppose the Charge laid against the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the same Christ laid against the
Pharisees, will be fully made good, as to this instance;
For this is <hi>one of the sorts</hi> of that Crime, to say, <hi>Dixit
Dominus, Dominus autem non dixit;</hi> to pretend a
Rite to be of Divine institution when it is not so, but
<hi>humanum inventum,</hi> a device of man's brain. <hi>The
other</hi> (which is, still supposing an institution to be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and positive, yet to urge it with the same severe
Religion, as they do a Divine Commandment) I shall
consider in other instances. For the present, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
is concerning <hi>Auricular Confession,</hi> and it's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
necessity. The first Decree concerning it, was
in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council;<note place="margin">Can. 21.</note> in which <hi>every person of years
of discretion, is commanded to confess all his sins to his
own Priest, at least once in the year; or to another Priest,
with the leave of his own; otherwise, while he is living,
he must be driven from entrance into the Church; and,
when he is dead, he must have no Christian Burial.</hi> This
is very severe; but yet here is no damnation to them
that neglect it; and the duty is not pretended to be
by Divine Commandment: and therefore lest that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
might seem too much to be laid upon humane


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64671:167"/>
Law, they made it up in the new forge at <hi>Trent;</hi> and
there it was decreed that, <hi>To confess all, and every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

every evil thought or desire,</hi>

are, which are capable of exceptions, restrictions, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

                  <p>The Question then is, Whether to confess all our
greater sins to a Priest, all that upon strict enquiry we
can remember, be necessary to salvation? This the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now affirms; and this the Church of

                  <p>1. And in the first place, I shall represent that the
doctrine of the necessity of Confession to a Priest is a
new doctrine, even in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was
not esteemed any part of the Catholick Religion before

with the</hi> Greeks; <hi>because no such tradition hath come to
them.]</hi> This is the full state of this affair, in the age
when <hi>Semeca,</hi> who was the Glossator, liv'd; and it is
briefly this. 1. There was no resolution, or agreement
whence it came. 2. The Glossator's opinion was, it
came from the Universal tradition of the Church. 3. It
was but a kind of Universal tradition; not absolute,
clear, and certain. 4. It was only a tradition in the
<hi>Latin</hi> Church. 5. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had no such tradition.
6. The <hi>Greeks</hi> were not oblig'd to it; it was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to them. Concerning the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, I shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
consider it in a more opportune place; here only
I consider it as it was in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church: and of this
I suppose there needs no better Record than the Canon
Law it self, and the authentick Glosses upon it; which
Glosses, although they be not Law, but as far as they
please, yet they are perfect testimony as to matter of
fact, and what the opinions of the Doctors were at that
time. And therefore to the former, I add this; that in
<hi>cap. Convertimini, Gratian</hi> hath these words, <hi>Vnde da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

Without confession of the mouth we may obtain
pardon of our sins; and this point he pursues in all that
long Chapter; and in the chapter <hi>Resuscitatus,</hi> out of
S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s doctrine; and in the Chapter <hi>Qui natus,</hi> out
of the doctrine of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Epistle; the conclusion of
which Chapter is, <hi>Cum ergo ante Confessionem (ut pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum

Chapter <hi>Omnis qui non diligit,</hi> he expressly concludes
out of S. <hi>John</hi>'s words: <hi>Non ergo in confessione peccatum

                        </gap>.</hi> And at the end of this Chapter, according
to his custom in such disputable things; when he says,


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64671:168"/>
                     <hi>Alii è contrario testantur;</hi> others witness to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that without confession Oral, and works of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
no man is cleansed from his sin; the Gloss
upon the place, says thus: <hi>Ab hoc loco usque ad Sed his
authoritatibus; pro aliâ parte allegat, quod scil. adulto
peccatum non dimittitur sine oris Confessione, quod tamen
falsum est:</hi> Only he says, that <hi>Confession doth cleanse,
and Satisfaction doth cleanse: so that though by contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heart, the sin is pardon'd; yet these still cleanse
more and more, as a man is more innovated]</hi> or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>But these authorities brought in, (viz.</hi> that sin is
not pardon'd without confession) <hi>if they be diligently
expounded, prove but little.]</hi> But Frier <hi>Maurique,</hi> who
by <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> made and publish'd a censure upon
the Glosses, appointed these words <hi>(quod tamen fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum

<hi>Greg. 13th.</hi> let them alone; but put in the Margent a
mark of contradiction upon it; saying, <hi>Imò verissimum
est.</hi> But that was new doctrine, and although <hi>Semeca,</hi>
the Author of the Gloss, affirm'd it expressly to be
false, yet <hi>Gratian</hi> himself was more reserv'd; but yet
not of the new opinion, but left the matter indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:

there is no reason enforcing this necessity, but very

contrary: and the consequent of these things will
be, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath introduced a new
doctrine, false, and burdensome, dangerous and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious.</p>
                  <p>1. If we consider how this Article is managed in
Scripture, we shall find that our Blessed Saviour said
nothing at all concerning it; the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
makes their new doctrine to relie upon the words

the Author of the <hi>Summa Angelica, Hugo de

differing much in the particulars of this question,
yet all consent that precisely from the words of Christ,
no necessity of Confession to a Priest can be concluded.
2. Amongst those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church who did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to found the necessity of Confession upon
those words, None do agree about the way of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their argument;<note place="margin">In lib. 4. sent. dist. 17.</note> as may be seen in <hi>Scotus, Aureolus,

                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:64671:170"/>
When Christ said to his Apostles, <hi>Whose sins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
they shall be remitted to them; and whose sins ye
retain, they shall be retained;</hi> he made (says <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
and generally the latter School of <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors)
the Apostles, and all Priests, Judges upon earth;
that, without their sentence, no man that hath sinned
after Baptism, can be reconciled. But the Priests who
are Judges can give no right or unerring sentence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they hear all the particulars they are to judge.
Therefore by Christs law they are tied to tell in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
all their particular sins to a Priest: This is the
summe of all that is said in this affair. Other light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
there are, but the main battel is here.</p>
                  <p>Now all the parts of this great Argument must be
considered: And 1. I deny the argument; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
both the premisses true, that Christ had made
them judges, and that without particular cognisance
they could not give judgement according to Christs
intention; yet it follows not, that therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that the penitent shall confess all his sins to the
Priest. For, Who shall compel the penitent to appear in
judgement? Where are they oblig'd to come and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
themselves before the judges? Indeed if they
were before them, we will suppose the Priests to have
power to judge them; but how can it be hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
that the penitents are bound to come to this
Judicatory, and not to stand alone to the Divine tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
A Physician may have power to cure diseases, yet
the Patients are not bound to come to him; neither
it may be will they, if they can be cur'd by other means.
And if a King sends a Judge with competent autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to judge all the Questions in a Province; he can
judge them that come, but he cannot compel them to
come; and they may make an end of their quarrels
among themselves, or by arbitration of neighbours;
and if they have offended the King, they may address


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64671:170"/>
themselves to his clemency, and sue for pardon. And
since it is certain by their own confession, that a penitent
cannot by the force of these words of Christ be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to confess his venial sins, how does it appear, that
he is tied to confess his mortal sins? For if a man be
tied to <hi>repent</hi> of all his sins, then <hi>repentance</hi> may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without the ministery of the Priest, or else he
must repent before the Priest for all his sins. But if he
may repent of his venial sins, and yet not go to the
Priest; then to go to the Priest is not an essential part
of the repentance: and if it be thus in the case of venial
sins, let them shew from the words of Christ any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the case between the one and the other, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we consider, that though it may be convenient
to go to the Priest to be taught and guided, yet the
necessity of going to him is to be absolved by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.
But that of this there was no necessity believ'd
in the Primitive Church, appears in this; because they
did not expect pardon from the Bishop or Priest in the
greatest Crimes, but were referred wholly to God for
the pardon of them: <hi>Non sine spe tamen remissionis,
quàm ab eo planè sperare debebit qui ejus largitatem
solus obtinet; &amp; tam dives misericordiae est, ut nemo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speret:</hi>
So said the Bishops of <hi>France</hi> in their Synod
held about the time of Pope <hi>Zephyrinus.</hi> To the same
purpose are the words of <hi>Tertullian; Salvâ illâ poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae
specie post fidem, quae aut levioribus delictis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam
ab Episcopo consequi poterit, aut majoribus &amp; ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remissibilibus
à Deo solo.</hi> The like also is in the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Now first it is easie to observe how
vast the difference is between the old Catholick Church
and the present <hi>Roman:</hi> these say, that <hi>venial sins</hi> are
not of necessity to be confessed to the Priest or Bishop;
and that without their Ministery they can be pardoned:
But they of old said, that the smaller sins were to be
submitted to the Bishop's Ministery. On the other side,


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64671:171"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors say, it is absolutely necessary to
bring our <hi>mortal sins,</hi> and confess them, in order to be
absolved by the Priest; but the old Catholicks said,
that the <hi>greatest sins</hi> are wholly to be confessed and
<hi>submitted to God,</hi> who may pardon them if he please,
and will if he be rightly sought to; but to the Church
they need not be confessed, because these were onely
and immediately fit for the Divine Cognisance. What
is now a-days a reserved case to the Pope, was anciently
a case reserved to God; and what was onely submitted
formerly to the Bishop, is now not worth much taking
notice of by any one. But now put these together. By
the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine, you are not <hi>by the duty of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
tied to confess your venial sins; and by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive,
it is to no purpose to bring the greatest crimes
to Ecclesiastical repentance; but by their immediate
address to God they had hopes of pardon: From hence
it follows, that there is no necessity of doing one or
other, that is, there is no Commandment of God for it;
nor yet any necessity in the Nature of the thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it.</p>
                  <p>Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> had an opinion that those sins onely

autem peccata à Domino sine confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione

Whether or no hath the
Priest a power to remit venial sins,
and that this power (in the words


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64671:171"/>
of S. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. XX.) was given to him by Christ? If
Christ did in these words give him power to remit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
sins, and yet the penitent is not bound to recount
them in particular, or at all to submit them to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory;
it will follow undeniably, that the giving
power of remission of sins to the Priest, does not inferre
a necessity in the penitent to come to confess them.
And these things I suppose <hi>Vasquez</hi> understood well
enough; when he affirms expressly, that it may well
stand with the ordinary power of a Judge, that his
power be such as that it be free for the subjects to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it, or to end their controversies another way.
And that it was so in this case, is the doctrine of<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Vasquez. in 3. tom. 4. q. 90. art. 1. dub. 2. Sect. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
above cited, and many others. Add to this, the
Argument of<note n="*" place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> 
                     <hi>Scotus,</hi> The Priest retains no sins, but
such, which some way or other are declar'd to him to
have no true signs of repentance; &amp; yet those which are
no way manifested to the Priest, God retains unto the
vengeance of Hell: therefore neither is that word
<hi>(whose sins ye remit)</hi> precise; that is, If God retains
some which the Priest does not retain, then also he
does remit some which the Priest does not remit; and
therefore there is no negative affix'd to the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which shews that the remission, or retention
does not necessarily depend on the Priest's ministration.
So that, supposing it to be true, that the Priest hath a
power to remit, or retain sins, as a Judge, and that this
power cannot be exercis'd without knowing what he is
to judge; yet it follows not from hence, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are bound to come this way, and to confess their sins
to them, or to ask their pardon. But</p>
                  <p>2. The second proposition is also false: for, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Priest by the words of Christ, hath given to
him the ordinary power of a Judge; and that, as such,
he hath power of remitting and retaining sins: yet this
power of judging may be such, as that it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64671:172"/>
without enumeration of all the particulars we
remember. For the Judgement the Priest is to make,
is <hi>not of the sins,</hi> but <hi>of the persons.</hi> It is not said
<hi>Quaecunque,</hi> but <hi>Quorumcunque remiseritis peccata.</hi>
Our Blessed Saviour in these words did not distinguish
two sorts of sins, one to be remitted, and an other to
be retained; so that it should be necessary to know
the special nature of the sins: he only reckon'd one
kind, that is, under which all sins are contain'd. But
he distinguish'd two sorts of sinners; saying, <hi>Quorum,</hi>
and <hi>Quorum;</hi> the one of Penitents (according to the
whole design and purpose of the Gospel) and their
sins are to be remitted;<note place="margin">Vid. Padre Paolo hist. Conc. Trid. lib. 4.</note> and an other of Impenitent,
whose sins are not to be remitted, but retained. And
therefore it becomes the Ministers of Souls, to know
the state of the penitent, rather than the nature and
number of the sins. Neither gave he any power to
punish, but to pardon, or not to pardon. If Christ
had intended to have given to the Priests a power to
impose a punishment according to the quality of every
sin; the Priest indeed had been the Executioner of the
Divine wrath: but then, because no punishment in this
life can be equal to the demerit of a sin which deserves
the eternal wrath of God; it is certain, the Priest is
not to punish them by way of vengeance. We do not
find any thing in the words of Christ, obliging the
Priest directly to impose penances on the penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
he may voluntarily submit himself to them if he
please, and he may do very well, if he do so: but <hi>the
power of retaining sins,</hi> gives no power to punish him
whether he will or no; for the power of retaining is
rather to be exerciz'd upon the impenitent, than upon
the penitent. Besides this, the word of <hi>[remitting]
sins,</hi> does not certainly give the Priest a power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
penances; for it were a prodigie of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to expound <hi>remittere</hi> by <hi>punire.</hi> But if by <hi>[re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining]</hi>


                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:64671:172"/>
it be said, this power is given him; then this
must needs belong to the impenitent, who are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and not to the penitent, whose sins at that
time, they remit, and retain not: unless they can do
both at the same time. But if the punishment design'd,
be only by way of Remedy, or of disposing the sinners
to true penitence; then if the person be already truly
penitent, the Priest hath nothing to do, but to pardon
him in the name of God. Now certainly both these
things may be done without the special enumeration of
all his remembred sins. For 1. The penitent may, and
often does, forget many particulars; and then in that
case, all that the Priest can expect, or proceed to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon, is the saying in general, He is truly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
for them, and for the time to come will avoid
them: and if he then absolve the penitent, as he must,
and usually does; it follows, that if he does well (and
he can do no better) he may make a judgment of his
penitent without special enumeration of his sins; and
if the Priest pardons no sins but those which are enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated,
the penitent will be in an evil condition in
most cases: but if he can and does pardon those which
are forgotten, then the fpecial enumeration is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably
necessary; for it were a strange thing, if
sins should be easier remitted for being forgotten, and
the harder for being remembred; there being in the
Gospel no other condition mentioned, but <hi>the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and forsaking them:</hi> and if there be any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
certainly he, who out of carelessness of Spirit,
or the multitude of his sins, or want of the sharpness
of sorrow (for these commonly are the causes of it)
forgets many of his sins, is in all reason further from
pardon, than he whose conscience being sore wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
cannot forget that which stings him so perpetually.
If he that remembers most, because he is most peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
be tied to a more severe Discipline, than he that


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64671:173"/>
remembers least; then according to this discipline, the
worst man is in the best condition. But what if the
sinner, out of bashfulness, do omit to enumerate
some sin? Is there no consulting with his modesty? Is
there no help for him, but he must confess, or die? S.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> gives a perfect answer to this case, <hi>Lavant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymae

that if men fear to confess lest they be disgrac'd, or lest
others should be tempted by their evil example; and
therefore conceal them to man, and reveal them to
God; they obtain pardon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> for those sins which they do enumerate;
the Priest by them cannot make a truer judgement of
the penitent's repentance and disposition to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than he can by his general profession of his true
and deep contrition, and such other humane indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by which such things are signified. For still it is
to be remembred he is not the judge of the sin, but of
the man. For Christ hath left no rules by which the
sin is to be judged; no penitential tables, no Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tax, no penitential Canons; neither did his Apostles:
and those which were in use in the Primitive Church,
as they were vastly short of the merit of the sins, so
they are very vastly greater than are now in use, or
will be endur'd: By which it plainly enough appears,
that they impose penances at their pleasure, as the
people are content to take them; and for the greatest
sins we see they impose ridiculous penances; and
themselves profess they impose but a part of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that is due: which certainly cannot be any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with any law of God, which is always wiser,
more just, and more to purpose. And therefore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
a special enumeration of all our sins remembred, to
enable the Priest onely to impose a part of penance, is
as if a Prince should raise an army of 10000 men to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a tumult raised in a little village against the petty
Constable. Besides which, in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they
have an old rule which is to this day in use among
them;


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64671:174"/>
                     <q>
                        <l>Sìtque modus poenae justae moderatio culpae;</l>
                        <l>Quae tanto levior, quanto contritio major.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, <hi>fortiter contritus leviter plectatur;</hi>
He that is greatly sorrowful, needs but little penance.
By which is to be understood, that the penance is but
to supply the want of internal sorrow; which the
Priest can no way make judgement of, but by such
signs as the penitent is pleased to give him. To what
purpose then can it be to enumerate all his sins; which
he can do with a little sorrow, or a great one, with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
or Contrition, and no man knows it, but God
alone; and it may be done without any sorrow at all,
and the sorrow may be put on, or acted; and when
the penance is impos'd, as it must needs be less than
the sin, so it may be performed without true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And therefore neither is the imposing penance
any sufficient signification of what the Priest inquires
after. And because every deliberate sin deserves more
than the biggest penance that is impos'd on any man
for the greatest, and in that as to the sin it self there
can be no errour in the greatness of it; it follows that
by the particular enumeration the Priest cannot be
helped to make his judgement of the person; and by
it or any thing else he can never equally punish the sin;
therefore supposing the Priest to be a judge, the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of particular confession will not be necessary: <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we consider,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That by the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation that the penitent should perform
any penances, he may defer them to Purgatory if he
please; so that, special Confession cannot be necessary
to salvation for the reason pretended, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Priest may judge well concerning imposing penances,
since they are necessary onely for the avoiding Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and not for the avoiding damnation. 4. This


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64671:174"/>
further appears in the case of Baptism; which is the
most apparent and evident use of the power of the
Keys, it being truly and properly the intromission of
Catachumens into the house of God, and an admitting
them to all the Promises and Benefits of the Kingdom,
and, which is the greatest, the most absolute and most
evident remission of all the sins precommitted; and yet
towards the dispensing this pardon, no particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of sins is previous, by any necessity or Divine
Law. Repentance in persons of choice and discretion
is and was always necessary: but because persons were
not tied to confess their sins particularly to a Priest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Baptism; it is certain, that Repentance can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
without this Confession. And this argument is yet
of greater force and persuasion against the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> for since Baptizing is for remission of sins, and
is the first act of the power of the Keys, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
way of opening the doors of the house of God,
and yet the power of baptizing is, in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in the absence of a Priest, given to a lay-man,
and frequently to a Deacon; it follows, that the power
of the Keys, and a power of remitting sins is no Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary
act; unless a Lay-man be declar'd capable of
the power of judging, and of remitting sins. 5.<note place="margin">5</note> If
we consider, that without true repentance no sin can
be pardon'd; and with it all sins may; and that no one
sin is pardon'd as to the final state of our souls, but at
the same time all are pardon'd: it must needs follow,
that it is not the number of sins, but the condition of
the person, the change of his life, the sorrow of his
heart, the truth of his Conversion, and his hatred of all
sin, that he is to consider. If his repentance be a true
change from evil to good, from sin to God, a thousand
sins are pardon'd as soon as one; and the infinite mercy
of God does equally exceed one sin and one thousand.
Indeed, in order to counsel or comfort, it may be


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64671:175"/>
very useful to tell all that grieves the penitent, all that
for which he hath no rest, and cannot get satisfaction:
but as to the exercising any other judgment upon the
man, either for the present, or for the future; to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
up what is past seems not very useful, or at all
reasonable: But as the Priest, who baptizes a Convert,
judges of him, as far as he can, and ought; that is,
whether he hath laid aside every hindrance, and be
dispos'd to receive remission of sins by the Spirit of
God in Baptism: so it is in Repentance, the man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and change is to be considered; which cannot
be by what is past, but by what is present, or future.</p>
                  <p>And now, 3:<note place="margin">3</note> Although the judicial power of the
Priest cannot inferre the necessity of particular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
yet if the judicial power be also of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than is supposed, or rather be not properly <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium
fori,</hi> the judgment of a tribunal, coercive, poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and exterminating by proper effect, and real
change of state and person; then the superstructure,
and the foundation too, will be digged down. And
this therefore shall be consider'd briefly. And here the
Scene is a little chang'd, and the words of Christ to S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> are brought in as auxiliaries, to prove the Priest's
power to be judicial; and that, with the words of
Christ to his Apostles, <hi>John</hi> XX, must demonstrate this
point. 1. Therefore I have the testimony and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Master of the Sentences, affirming that the
Priest's power is <hi>declarative,</hi> not <hi>judicial;</hi> the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of an Embassadour,<note place="margin">Sent. lib. 4. dist. 18. lit. F.</note> not of a Judge; <hi>Sacerdoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

                     <q>The Priest's
power of loosing and binding, is a power of shewing
and declaring who are bound, and who are loosed.
For when Christ had cur'd the Leper, he sent him
to the Priest, by whose judgment he was to be
declar'd clean: and when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was first restor'd


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64671:175"/>
to life by Christ, then he bade his Disciples loose
him and let him go.]</q> And if it be inquir'd, To what
purpose is the Priest's Solution, if the man be pardon'd
already? It is answer'd; that<q>Although he be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
before God, yet he is not accounted loosed in
the face of the Church, but by the judgment of the
Priest.]</q> But we have the Sentence of a greater man in
the Church,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>S.</hi> Hierom in Matth. lib. 3. ad cap. 16.</note> than <hi>Peter Lombard; viz.</hi> of S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
himself, who discourses this affair dogmatically and
fully, and so as not to be capable of evasion: speaking
of those words of Christ to S. <hi>Peter, I will give to thee
the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; whatsoever thou
shalt bind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n Earth, shall be bound in Heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou shalt loose in Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven:</hi>
This place (saith S. <hi>Hierom) some Bishops and Priests
not understanding, take upon them something of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiousness
of the Pharisees, so as to condemn the
Innocent, or think to acquit the Guilty; whereas God
inquires not, what is the Sentence of the Priest, but the
life of the Guilty. In</hi> Leviticus, <hi>the Lepers were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to shew themselves to the Priests, who neither
make them leprous, nor clean; but they discern, who are
clean, and who are unclean. As therefore there, the Priest
makes the leprous man clean, or unclean: So here, does the
Bishop, or the Priest bind or loose;</hi> i. e. <hi>according to their
Office, when he hears the variety of sins, he knows who is
to be bound, and who is to be loosed.]</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> adds
one advantage more, as consequent to the Priest's
absolving of penitents; but expresly declares against
the proper <hi>judicial power. [Men give their Ministery
in the remission of sins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Homines in remissione peccatorum ministerium suum exhibent, non jus alicujus potestatis exercent: Neque enim in suo, sed in Nomine Patris, Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti, peccata di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittuntur.

                     <hi>but they
exercise not the right of any power:
neither are sins remitted by them in
their own, but in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Men
pray, but it is God who forgives: It is mans obsequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64671:176"/>
but the bountiful gift is from God. So likewise, there
is no doubt, sins are forgiven in Baptism, but the operation
is of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.]</hi> Here, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>
affirms the Priest's power of pardoning sins, to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ministerial, and Optative or by way of Prayer. Just
as it is in Baptism, so it is in Repentance after Baptism:
Sins are pardon'd to the truly penitent; but here is no
proper Judicial power. The Bishop prays, and God
pardons: the Priest does his Ministery, and God gives
the gift. Here are three witnesses against whom there
is no exception; and what they have said, was good
Catholick doctrine in their ages; that is, from the
fourth age after Christ, to the eleventh: How it hath
fallen into Heresie since that time, is now not worth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring;
but yet how reasonable that old doctrine is,
is very fit to consider.</p>
                  <p>4. Of necessity it must be true; because what ever
kind of absolution, or binding it is, that the Bishops and
Priests have power to use; it does it's work intended,
without any real changing of state in the penitent.
The Priest alters nothing; he diminishes no man's
right; he gives nothing to him but what he had before.
The Priest baptizes, and he absolves, and he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates,
and he prays, and he declares the will of God;
and, by importunity, he compells men to come, and if
he find them unworthy, he keeps them out; but it is
such, as he finds to be unworthy: Such who are in a
state of perdition, he cannot, he ought not to admit
to the Ministeries of life. True it is, he prays to God
for pardon, and so he prays that God will give the
sinner the grace of Repentance; but he can no more
give Pardon, than he can give Repentance; he that
gives this, gives that.</p>
                  <p>And it is so also in the case of Absolution; he can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
none but those that are truly penitent: he can give
thanks indeed to God on his behalf; but as that Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64671:176"/>
supposes pardon, so that Pardon supposes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
and if it be true Repentance, the Priest
will as certainly find him pardon'd, as find him peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
And therefore we find in the old Penitentials
and Usages of the Church, that the Priest did not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the penitent in the Indicative or Judicial form.
To this purpose it is observed by <hi>Goar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 676.</note> in the <hi>Eucholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
that now, <hi>many do freely assert, and tenaciously
defend, and clearly teach, and prosperously write that
the solemn form of reconciling,</hi> Absolvo te à peccatis tuis,
<hi>is not perhaps above the age of 400 years; and that the old
form of Absolution in the Latin Church, was composed in
words of deprecation, so far forth as we may conjecture
out of the Ecclesiastical history, ancient Rituals, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and other Testimonies without exception.]</hi> And in
the <hi>Opuscula</hi> of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Opusc. 22.</note> he tells that a Doctor
said to him, that the Optative form, or deprecatory,
was the Usual; and that then it was not thirty years
since the Indicative form of, <hi>Ego te Absolvo,</hi> was us'd;
which computation, comes neer the computation made
by <hi>Goar.</hi> And this is the more evidently so, in that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that in the ancient Discipline of the Church, a
Deacon might reconcile the penitents, if the Priest were
absent:<note place="margin">Aleuin. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini Offic. cap. De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this affair, then the Priest is not indispensably necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor his power judicial and pretorial.</p>
                  <p>But besides this, the power of the Keys is under the
Master in the hands of the Steward of the house; who
is the Minister of Government: and the power of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi>
and <hi>retaining</hi> being but the verification of the
Promise of the Keys, is to be understood by the same
analogy, and is exercised in many instances, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great purposes, though no man had ever dreamt
of a judicial power of absolution of secret sins; <hi>viz.</hi> in


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64671:177"/>
discipline and government, in removing scandals, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
persons <hi>overtaken in a fault</hi> to the peace of the
Church, in sustaining the weak, in cutting off of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
members, in rejecting hereticks, in preaching peace
by Jesus Christ, and repentance through his name, and
ministering the word of reconciliation, and interceding
in the ministery of Christ's mediation; that is, being
God's Embassadour, he is God's Messenger in the great
work of the Gospel, which is <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.</hi>
In short, <hi>Binding</hi> and <hi>Loosing, remitting</hi> and
<hi>retaining,</hi> are acts of Government, relating to publick
discipline. And of any other pardoning or retaining,
no Man hath any power but what he ministers in the
Word of God and prayer, unto which the Ministery of
the Sacraments is understood to belong. For what
does the Church, when she binds a sinner, or retains
his sin, but separate him from the communication of
publick Prayers and Sacraments? according to that
saying of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apolog. c. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>Summum futuri judicii prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicium
est, si quis ita deliquerit, ut à communicatione
orationis &amp; conventus &amp; omnis sancti commercii rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getur.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Homil. 50. c. 9.</note>
And the like was said by S. <hi>Austin, Versetur
ante oculos imago futuri judicii, ut cum alii accedunt
ad altare Dei, quo ipse non accedit, cogitet quàm sit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremiscenda
illa poena, qua percipientibus aliis vitam
aeternam, alii in mortem praecipitantur aeternam.</hi> And
when the Church, upon the sinner's repentance, does
restore him to the benefit of publick Assemblies and
Sacraments; she does truly pardon his sins, that is, she
takes off the evil that was upon him for his sins. For so
Christ prov'd his power on Earth to forgive sins by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the poor man's palsie away: and so does the
Church pardon his sins by taking away that horrible
punishment of separating him from all the publick
communion of the Church: and both these are, in their
several kinds, the most material and proper pardons.</p>

But then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Church gives pardon propertion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the evil she inflicts, which God also will verifie,
if it be done here in truth, and righteousness; so there
is a pardon, which God onely gives. He is the injured
and offended Person, and he alone can remit of his
own right. But yet to this pardon the Church does
co-operate by her Ministery. Now what this pardon is
we understand best by the evils that are by him inflicted
upon the sinner. For to talk of a power of pardoning
sins, where there is no power to take away the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sin, is but a dream of a shadow: sins are only
then pardoned, when the punishment is removed. Now
who but God alone can take away a sickness, or rescue
a soul from the power of his sins, or snatch him out of
the Devils possession? The Spirit of God alone can do
this, <hi>It is the spirit that quickneth,</hi> and raiseth from
spiritual death, and giveth us the life of God. Man
can pray for the spirit, but God alone can give it;
our Blessed Saviour obtain'd for us the Spirit of God
by this way, by prayer; <hi>I will pray unto the Father,
and he shall give you another Comforter, even the spirit
of truth;</hi> and therefore much less do any of Christ's
Ministers convey the spirit to any one, but by prayer
and holy Ministeries in the way of prayer: But this is
best illustrated by the case of Baptism.<note place="margin">Summ. part. 4. q. 21. memb. 1.</note> 
                     <q>It is a matter
of equal power (said <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Ales)</hi> to baptize

should place our hope in Man.</q>

can give the holy Ghost to a repenting sinner; so he
can give him pardon, and no otherwise: that is, by

Communion of Saints, in the Immissions and visitations

is intrusted to the Ministery of the Church, is that rule

day; and therefore by the word of God we stand or
fall, we are bound or loosed: which word when the
Ministers of the Gospel dispense rightly, they bind or
loose; and what they so bind or loose on earth, God
will bind and loose in heaven. That is, by the same
measures he will judge the man, by which he hath
commanded his Ministers to judge them by; that is,
they preach remission of sins to the penitent, and God
will make it good; and they threaten eternal death to
the impenitent, and God will inflict it. But other
powers of binding and loosing than what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

The Ministers of the Gospel do pardon sins, just as they
save men;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>This doing, thou shalt save thy self, and them

And if it be said, that a lay-man can do this: I
answer, It is very well for him if he does; and he can,
if it please God to assist him: but the ordinary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
is appointed to Bishops and Priests: so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a lay-man do it extraordinarily, that can be no
prejudice to the ordinary power of the Keys in the
hands of the Clergy; which is but a ministery of prayer,


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64671:179"/>
of the Word and Sacraments: according to the saying
of their own <hi>Ferus</hi> upon this place; <q>Christ in this
word shews how, and to what use, he at this time gave
them the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">John 20.</note> to wit, for the remission of sins:
neither for the Apostles themselves alone; <hi>sed ut eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem

                     </q>
And again, he brings in Christ saying, <hi>I
therefore chuse you, and I seal your hearts by the Holy
Ghost unto the word of the Gospel, and confirm you, that
going into the world, ye may preach the Gospel to every
Creature, and that ye may distribute that very remission
by the word of the Gospel, and the Sacraments.]</hi> For
the words of Christ are general and indefinite; and
they are comprehensive of the whole power and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
Ecclesiastical: and in those parts of it which are
evident, and confessed, <hi>viz.</hi> preaching remission of
sins and Baptism, a special enumeration of our sins is
neither naturally necessary, nor esteemed so by custom,
nor made so by vertue of these words of Christ; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no way necessary, neither have they at all
proved it so by Scripture. And to this I add only what
<hi>Ambrosius Pelargus,</hi> a Divine of the Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi>
said in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi>

                     <hi>That the words of our

Penance: and that by some they were understood of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
by others, of any other thing by which pardon of
sins is received.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But since there is no necessity declar'd in Scripture of
confessing all our sins to a Priest, no mention of sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
penance, or confession, it must needs seem
strange that a doctrine of which there is no Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Scripture, no direction for the manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so difficult a work, no Office, or Officer describ'd
to any such purpose; that a doctrine, I say, of which


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64671:179"/>
in the fountains of salvation there is no spring, should
yet become in process of time to be the condition
of salvation: And yet for preaching, praying, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
communicating, we have precept upon precept,
and line upon line; we have in Scripture three Epistles
written to two Bishops, in which the Episcopal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is abundantly describ'd; and excellent Canons
established; and the parts of their duty enumerated:
and yet no care taken about the Office of <hi>Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.</hi>
Indeed we find a pious exhortation to all <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
persons,</hi> that; <hi>If any man be overtaken in a fault,
they should restore such a one in the spirit of meekness;</hi>
restore him, that is, to the publick peace and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church, from which by his delinquency
he fell; and restore him also, by the word of his proper
Ministery, to the favour of God; by exhortations to
him, by reproving of him, by praying for him: and
besides this, we have some little limits more, which the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they please, may make good use of
in this Question;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 20.</note> such as are, <hi>That they who sin should
be rebuk'd before all men, that others also may fear;</hi>
which indeed is a good warranty for publick Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
but very little for private Confession. And Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> charges <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he should <hi>should lay hands
suddenly on no man,</hi> that he be not partaker of other
mens sins; which is a good caution against the <hi>Roman</hi>
way of absolving them that confess, as soon as they
have confess'd, before they have made their Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.
The same Apostle speaks also of <hi>some that
creep into houses, and lead captive silly women;</hi> I
should have thought he had intended it against such as
then abus'd Auricular Confession; it being so like
what they do now; but that S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing of
these lately-introduced practices: and lastly, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
every one that is to receive the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<hi>to examine himself, and so let him eat:</hi> he forgot,


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64671:180"/>
it seems, to enjoyn them to go to confession to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd:
which certainly he could never have done more
opportunely than here; and if it had been necessary,
he could never have omitted it more undecently. But
it seems, the first Christians were admitted upon other
terms by the Apostles, than they are at this day by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Clergy. And indeed it were infinitely strange,
that since in the Old Testament remission of sins was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to every one that confessed to God, &amp; turn'd from
his evil way,<note n="*" place="margin">Isai. 1. 16. 17. 18.</note> that,<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 22.</note> in the New Testament,<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 33. 15. 16.</note> to which
liberty is a special priviledge,<note n="*" place="margin">Isai. 30. 15. <hi>secundum.</hi>
                     </note> and the imposed yoke of
Christ infinitely more easie than the burden of the Law;<note n="*" place="margin">LXX. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>
and Repentance is the very formality of the Gospel-Covenant;
and yet that, pardon of our sins shall not
be given to us Christians on so easie terms as it was to
the Jews; but an intolerable new burden shall be made
a new condition of obtaining pardon. And this will
appear yet the more strange; when we consider that
all the Sermons of the Prophets concerning Repentance,
were not derivations from <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, but Homilies
Evangelical, and went before to prepare the way of
the Lord; and <hi>John Baptist</hi> was the last of them; and
that, in this matter, the Sermons of the Prophets were
but the Gospel antedated; and in this affair there was
no change but to the better and to a clearer manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine mercy, and the sweet yoke of
Christ: The Disciples of Christ preach'd the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Repentance that the Baptist did, and the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
the same that the Prophets did, and there was no
difference; Christ was the same in all, and he that
commanded his Disciples to fast to God alone in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
intended that all the parts of Repentance trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
between God and our consciences, should be as
sufficient as that one of Fasting, and that other of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
and it is said so in all; <hi>for if we confess our sins, he
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64671:180"/>
us from all unrighteousness.</hi> It it is God alone that can
cleanse our hearts, and he that cleanses us, he alone
does forgive us; and this is upon our confession to
him: his justice and faithfulness, is at stake for it; and
therefore it supposes a promise: which we often find
upon our confessions made to God, but it was never
promised upon confession made to the Priest.</p>
                  <p>But now in the next place if we consider, Whether
this thing be reasonable, to impose such a yoke upon
the necks of the Disciples, which upon their Fathers
was not put in the Old Testament, nor ever command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the New; we shall find that although many good
things, might be consequent to the religious and free,
and prudent use of Confession; yet by changing into a
Doctrine of God, that which at most, is but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of man, it will not, by all the contingent
good, make recompence for the intolerable evils it intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces.
And here first I consider, that many times things
seem profitable to us, and may minister to good ends;
but God judges them useless and dangerous: for he
judges not as we judge. The worshipping of Angels,
and the abstaining from meats, which some false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
introduc'd, look'd well, and pretended to humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and mortificatioh of the body; but the Apostle
approv'd them not: and of the same mind was the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ages of the Church, who condemned the dry
Diet, and the ascetick Fasts of <hi>Montanus,</hi> though they
were pretended only for discipline; but when they
came to be impos'd they grew intolerable. Certainly,
men liv'd better lives, when by the discipline of the
Church, sinners were brought to publick stations and
penance, than now they do by all the advantages, real
or pretended, from Auricular Confession; and yet the
Church thought fit to lay it aside, and nothing is left
but the shadow of it.</p>
                  <p>2. This whole topick can only by a prudential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64671:181"/>
and can no way inferre a Divine institution;
for though it was as convenient before Christ, as since,
&amp; might have had the same effects upon the publick or
private good, then, as now; yet God was not pleased to
appoint it in almost forty ages; and we say, He hath not
done it yet. However let it be consider'd, that there
being some things which S. <hi>Paul</hi> says are not to be so
much as nam'd amongst Christians; it must needs look
undecently, that all men &amp; all women should come and
make the Priests Ears a Common-shoar to empty all their
filthiness; and that which a modest man would blush
to hear, he must be us'd to, and it is the greatest part of
his imployment to attend to. True it is, that a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
must see and handle the impurest Ulcers; but it
is, because the Cure does not depend upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
but upon the Physician, who by general adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
cannot cure the Patient, unless he had an
Universal medicine, which the Priest hath; the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
of Repentance, which can indifferently cure all
sins, whether the Priest know them or no. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
all this filthy communication is therefore intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
because it is not necessary: and it not only pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes
the Priest's Ears, but his Tongue too; for, lest
any circumstance, or any sin be concealed, he thinks
himself oblig'd to interrogate, and proceed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
questions in the basest things. Such as that which
is to be seen in <hi>Burchard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 19. decret. de Matrimonio.</note> and such which are too large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
describ'd in <hi>Sanchez,;</hi> which thing does not only
deturpate all honest and modest conversation, but it
teaches men to understand more sins then ever they (it
may be) knew of. And I believe, there are but few
in the world at this day, that did ever think of such a
Crime, as <hi>Burchard</hi> hath taught them by that question;
and possibly it might have expir'd in the very first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
if there had been no further notice taken of
it. I need not tell how the continual representment


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64671:181"/>
of such things to the Priest, must needs infect the fancy
and the memory with filthy imaginations, and be a
state of temptation to them that are very often young
men and vigorous, and always unmarried and tempted.

                     <hi>tunc enim tenetur relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere
confessiones, &amp; auferre peccati occasionem; secus
non.</hi> This Question and this Answer I here bring to no
other purpose, but to represent that the Priests dwell
in temptation; and that their manner of receiving
Confessions is a perpetual danger, by which he that
loves it may chance to perish. And of this there have
been too many sad examples remark'd, evidencing that
this private Confession hath been the occasion and the
opportunity of the vilest crimes. There happened but


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64671:182"/>
one such sad thing in the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which
became publick by the discipline of publick Confession,
but was acted by the opportunity of the private Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
and that was then thought sufficient to alter
that whole discipline: but it is infinitely more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
to take off the law of private Confession, and in
that manner as it is enjoyned; if we consider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
evils which are committed frequently upon
this scene. <hi>Erasmus</hi> makes a sad complaint of it, that
the penitents do often light upon Priests, who under
the pretext of Confession,<note place="margin">In Exomolog. p. 128, 129, &amp;c.</note> commit things not to be
spoken of; and, in stead of Physicians, become partners,
or masters, or disciples of turpitude. The matter is
notorious and very scandalous, and very frequent: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that it produc'd two Bulls of two Popes <hi>contra
sollicitantes in Confessione;</hi> the first was of <hi>Pius quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
to the Bishop of <hi>Sevil, A. D. 1561. April</hi> the 16.
The other of <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth, 1622. <hi>August 30.</hi>
which Bulls take notice of it, and severely prohibit the
Confessors to tempt the women to Undecencies when
they come to confession. Concerning which Bulls, and
the sad causes procuring them, even the intolerable
and frequent impieties acted by and in Confessions, who
desires to be plentifully satisfied may please to read
the book of <hi>Johannes Escobar à Corro,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Videatur etiam Orlandini hist.</note> a Spanish Lawyer,
which is a Commentary on these two Bulls;<note place="margin">Societ. J. lib. 9.</note> and in the
beginning he shall find sad complaints and sadder
stories.<note place="margin">Sect. 70.</note> But I love not to stir up so much dirt. That
which is altogether as remarkable, and, it may be, much
more, is, that this Auricular Confession not onely can,
but oftentimes hath been made the most advantageous
way of plotting, propagating, and carrying on treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
propositions and designs. I shall not instance in that
horrid design of the <hi>Gun-powder treason;</hi> for that is
known every where amongst us; but in the <hi>Holy Ligue</hi>
of <hi>France.</hi>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64671:182"/>
and traiterous preachers, the Confessors in
private Confessions did that with more safety; they
slandered the King, endeavoured to prove it lawful
for Subjects to Covenant or make Leagues and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies
without their King's leave; they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
refus'd to absolve them, unless they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Ligue; and perswaded many miserable
persons to be of the faction. But this thing was not
done so secretly, but notice enough was taken of it;
and complaint was made to the Bishop, and then to
<hi>Franciscus Maurocenus</hi> the Cardinal Legat; who
gave notice and caution against it: and the effect it
produced was onely this; they proceeded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
more warily; and began to preach this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
That it was as great a fault if the Confitent
reveal what he hears from the Confessor in Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as if the Priest should reveal the sins told him by
the penitent.</q>

meddle with any State-affair. Now what advantage


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64671:183"/>
the Pope hath over Christian Princes in this particular,
and how much they have, and how much more they
may suffer by this Oeconomy, is a matter of great
consideration: <hi>Admonetur omnis aetas posse fieri, quod
jam factum vidimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. There is yet another very great evil that attends
upon the <hi>Roman</hi> way of Auricular Confession; and
that is, an eternal scruple of conscience, which to the
timerous and to the melancholy, to the pious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
and zealous, is almost unavoidable. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that there is no certainty of distinction between
the mortal and venial sins; there being no Catalogues
of one and the other, save only that they usually reckon
but seven deadly sins; and the rest are, or may be easily
by the ignorant supposed to be venial; and even those
sins which are under those seven heads, are not all
mortal; for there are amongst them many ways of
changing their mortality into veniality; and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to all this, they are either tempted to slight
most sins, or to be troubled with perpetual disputes
concerning almost every thing: besides this, I say,
there can be no peace (because there can be no certain
rule given) concerning the examination of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
for who can say, he hath done it sufficiently,
or who knows what is sufficient; and yet if it be not
sufficient, then the sins which are forgotten by careless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and not called to mind by sufficient diligence, are
not pardon'd, and then the penitent hath had much
trouble to no purpose. There are some Confessions
<hi>imperfect</hi> but <hi>valid,</hi> some <hi>invalid</hi> for their <hi>imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
some <hi>perfect,</hi> and yet <hi>invalid:</hi> and they that made
the distinction, made the Rule, and it binds as they
please; but it can cause scruples beyond their power
of remedy; because there is no certain principle from
whence men can derive peace and a certain determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
some affirming, and some denying, and both


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64671:183"/>
of them by chance, or humour. There are also many
reserv'd cases; some to the Bishop, some to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
some to the Pope; and when you shall have run
through the fire for these before the Priest, you must
run once or twice more; and your first absolution is
of no force: and amongst these reserv'd cases, there is
also great difference; some are reserved by reason of
censures Ecclesiastical, and some by reason of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the sin; and these things may be hidden from
his eyes, and he supposing himself absolv'd, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
himself deceiv'd; and absolv'd but from one
half. Some indeed think, that if the superiour ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
from the reserv'd cases alone, that grace is given
by which all the rest are remitted; and on the other
side, some think if the inferiour absolves from what
he can, grace is given of remitting even of the reserved:
but this is uncertain, and all agree, that the penitent
is never the nearer but that he is still oblig'd to confess
the reserv'd cases to the <hi>superiour,</hi> if he went first to
the <hi>inferiour;</hi> or all to the <hi>inferiour,</hi> in case he went
first to the <hi>superiour,</hi> confessing only the reserved.
There are also many difficulties in the Confession of
such things, in which the sinner had partners: for if he
confess the sin so, as to accuse any other, he sins; if he
does not, in many cases he cannot confess the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that alter the nature of the crime. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tell him, he may conceal such sins till a fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
others say, he may let it quite along: others
yet say, he may get another Confessor; but then there
will come another scruple, whether he may do this with
leave, or without leave; or, if he ask leave whether or no
in case it be denied him, he may take leave in such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.
Upon these and many other like accounts, there
will arise many more Questions concerning the iter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of his confession; for if the first confession be by
any means made invalid, it must be done over again.


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64671:184"/>
But here in the very beginning of this affair, the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
must be sure that his former confession was invalid.
For if it was, he cannot be pardon'd unless he renew it;
and if it was not, let him take heed: for to confess the
same things twice, and twice to be absolv'd, it may be
is not lawful;<note place="margin">Qaest quod libet Quaest. 6. de confess.</note> and against it, <hi>Cajetan,</hi> after the scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastical
manner, brings divers reasons. But suppose
the penitent at peace for this, then there are very many
cases, in which Confession is to be repeated; and
though it was done before, yet it must be done over
again. As if there be no manner of contrition, without
doubt it must be iterated; but there are many cases
concerning Contrition: and if it be at all, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
it is not to be iterated. But what is, and what
is not contrition; what is perfect, and what is imperfect;
which is the first degree that makes the Confession va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
can never be told. But then there is some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to be had; for, the Sacrament of Penance may
be true,<note place="margin">Cajetan: summ. verb. <hi>Confessio.</hi>
                     </note> and yet without form or life, at the same time.
And there are divers cases, in which the Confession that
is but materially half, may be reduc'd to that which is
but formally half: and if there be but a propinquity of
the mind to a carelessness concerning the integrity of
confession; the man cannot be sure, that things go
well with him. And sometimes it happens that the
Church is satified, when God is not satisfied, as in the
case of the <hi>informis confessio;</hi> and then the man is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
but his sin is not pardon'd; and yet, because
he thinks it is, his soul is cozen'd. And yet this is but
the beginning of scruples. For, suppose the penitent
hath done his duty, examin'd himself strictly, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sadly, confess'd fully, and is absolved formally; yet
all this may come to nothing by reason that there may
be some invalidity in the Ordination of the Priest, by
crime, by irregularity, by direct deficiency of something
in the whole Succession and Ordination; or it may


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64671:184"/>
be he hath not ordinary, or delegat jurisdiction; for, it is
not enough that he is a Priest, unless he have another
authority,<note place="margin">Summ. verb. <hi>Absolutio.</hi>
                     </note> says <hi>Cajetan;</hi> besides his Order, he must have
Jurisdiction, which is carefully to be inquir'd after, by
reason of the infinite numbers of Friers, that take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to hear Confessions; or if he have both, yet
the use of his power may be interverted or suspended
for the time, and then his absolution is worth nothing.
But here there is some remedy made to the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
penitent; for by the constitution of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Constance,</hi> under Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> though
the Priest be excommunicate, the confession is not to be
iterated: but then this also ends in scruples; for this
constitution it self does not hold, if the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be for the notorious smiting of a Clergy-man; or if
it be not, yet if the excommunication be denounc'd, be
it for what it will, his absolution is void: and therefore
the penitent should do well to look about him; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since, after all this, there may be innumerable
deficiencies; yea some even for want of skill and
knowledge in the Confessor; and when that happens,
when the confession is to be iterated, there are no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rules but it must be left to the opinion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Confessor. And when he comes, the poor peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
it may be, is no surer of him than of the other; for
if he have no will to absolve the penitent, let him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
it as he list, the absolution was but jocular, or
pretended, or never intended; or, it may be, he is secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Atheist, and laughs at the penitent &amp; himself too,
for acting (as he thinks) such a troublesome, theatrical
Nothing; and then the man's sins cannot be pardon'd.
And, is there no remedy for all this evil? It is true,
the cases are sad and dangerous, but the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath (such is her prudence &amp; indulgence) found
out as much relief as the wit of man can possibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
For though there may be thus many and many


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64671:185"/>
more deficiencies; yet there are some extraordinary ways
to make it up as well as it can. For, to prevent all the
contingent mischiefs, let the penitent be as wise as he
can, and chuse his man upon whom these defailances
may not be observed; For a man in necessity, as in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of death, may be absolved by any one that is a Priest;
but yet, if the penitent escape the sickness, or that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he must go to him again, or to somebody else; by
which it appears that his affair was left but imperfect.
But some persons have liberty by reason of their dignity,
&amp; some by reason of their condition, as being pilgrims or
wanderers; and they have greater freedom, and cannot
easily fall into many nullities; or they may have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite,
or an implicit licence: but then they must take
heed; for, besides many of the precedent dangers, they
must know that the license extends only to the Paschal
Confessions, or the usual; but not the extraordinary or
emergent: and moreover, they can go but to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Confessors, in the places where they are present; and
because under these there is the same danger, as in all
that went before, the little more certainty which I hop'd
for in some few cases, comes to nothing. But I go
about to reckon the sands on the shore. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
summe this up with the words of a famous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">Praesat. in lib. Tertul. de poeniter.</note>
reported by <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> to have made this
observation, that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus, men
too subtle, have made Confession to be such, that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their doctrines, it is impossible to confess:</hi> and
that the consciences of penitents, which should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated
and eased, are (by this means) catch'd in a
snare,<note place="margin">Consult. art. 11. videatur etiam Johannes de Sylva in fine tractat. de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rejurando.</note> and put to torments, said <hi>Cassander;</hi> so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Confession to a Priest prudently manag'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
scruple, upon the case of a griev'd and an unquiet
conscience, and in order to Counsel and the perfections
of Repentance, may be of excellent use; yet to enjoyn it
in all cases, to make it necessary to salvation, when God


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64671:185"/>
hath not made it so; to exact an Enumeration of all
our sins in all cases, and of all persons; to clog it with
so many questions and innumerable inextricable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and all this, besides the evil manage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of it, is the rack of Consciences, the slavery of
the Church, the evil snare of the simple, and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the craftie: it was or might have been as the
brazen serpent, a memorial of duty, but now it is
<hi>Nehushtan, aes eorum;</hi> something of their own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
                  <p>And this will yet further appear in this, That there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is no Ecclesiastical tradition of the necessity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
all our sins to a Priest in order to pardon. That
it was not the established doctrine of the Latine
Church, I have already prov'd in the beginning of
this Section; The case is notorious; and the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
law of this we find in <hi>Platina,</hi> in the life of Pope
<hi>Zephyrinus. Idem praetereà instituit, ut omnes Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,
annos pubertatis attingentes, singulis annis in solenni
die paschae publicè communicarent. Quod quidem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutum
Innocentius tertius deinceps non ad Communio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
solum, verum etiam ad Confessionem delictorum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxit.
Platina</hi> was the Pope's Secretary, and well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the interests of that Church, and was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
versed in the records and monuments of the
Popes; and tells, that as <hi>Zephyrinus</hi> commanded the
Eucharist to be taken at Easter; so <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Confession of sins.] Before this, there was
no command, no decree of any Council or Pope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
it: only in the Council of <hi>Cabailon,</hi> Can. 8. it
was declared to be profitable, that Penance should be
enjoyn'd to the penitent by the Priest, after Confession
made to him. But there was no command for it; and
in the second Council of <hi>Cabailon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">C. 33.</note> it was but a disputed
case, Whether they ought to confess to God alone, or
also to the Priest. Some said one, and some said an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64671:186"/>
                     <hi>Quod utrumque non sine magno fructu intra san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam

tells the particulars. <q>The Confession we make
to the Priests gives us this help, that, having received
his salutary counsel, by the most wholsom duties of
repentance, or by mutual prayers, we wash away the
stains of our sins. But the Confession we make to
God alone, avails us in this, because by how much
we are mindful of our sins, by so much the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
them; and on the contrary, by how much we
forget them, by so much the Lord remembers them,
according to the saying of the prophet, <hi>and I will
remember thy sins.]</hi>
                     </q> But the Fathers of the Council
gave a good account of these particulars also. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio

                     <hi>plerunque medicorum operatione:</hi> which
words are an excellent declaration of the advantages
of Confession to a Priest, but a full argument that it is
not necessary, or that without it pardon of sins is not
to be obtained. <hi>Gratian</hi> quoting the words cites <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but falsly: for it is
in the second Council of <hi>Cabailon,</hi> and not in <hi>Theodore</hi>'s
Penitential. But I will not trouble the Reader further,
in the matter of the Latine Church; in which it is
evident, by what hath been already said, there was
concerning this no Apostolical Tradition.</p>
                  <p>How it was in the Greek Church is onely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.
Now we might make as quick an end of this
also,<note place="margin">De poenit. dist. 5. c. In poenit.</note> if we might be permitted to take <hi>Semeca</hi>'s word,
the gloss of the Canon Law; which affirm's that, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of deadly sins is not necessary among the Greeks,
because no such tradition hath not descended unto them.</hi>
This acknowledgement and report of the Greeks


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64671:186"/>
not esteeming Confession to a Priest to be necessary,
is not only in the Gloss above cited;<note place="margin">De poenit. dist. 1. c. Quidam Deo.</note> but in <hi>Gratian</hi>
himself, and in the more ancient Collection of Canons
by <hi>Burchard,</hi> and <hi>Ivo Carnotensis. Bellarmine</hi> fancies
that these words <hi>[ut Graeci]</hi> are crept into the Text
of <hi>Gratian</hi> out of the Margent. Well! suppose that;
but then how came they into the elder Collections of
<hi>Burchard,</hi> and <hi>Ivo?</hi> That's not to be told; [but creep
in they did, some way or other; because they are not
in the Capitular of <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
and yet from thence this Canon was taken; and that
Capitular was taken from the second Council of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baillon;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De poenit. lib. 3. cap. 5.</note>
in which also, there are no such words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:]
So the Cardinal. In which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> betrays
his carelessness, or his ignorance, very greatly. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

2. He indeed made a Penitential, a Copy of
which is in <hi>Benet</hi> College Library in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> from
whence I have receiv'd some Extracts, by the favour
and industry of my friends; and another Copy of it, is
in Sir <hi>Robert Cotten</hi>'s Library. 3. True it is, there is
in that Penitential no such words as <hi>[ut Graeci]</hi> but
a direct affirmation, <hi>Confessionem suam Deo soli, si ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

this Chapter out of the second Council of <hi>Cabaillon,</hi> is
an intolerable piece of ignorance or negligence in so
great a Schollar as <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> when it is notorious
that the Council was after <hi>Theodore,</hi> above 120. years.
5. But then lastly, because <hi>Theodore,</hi> though he sate in
the Seat of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> yet was a <hi>Greek</hi> born; his
words are a good Record of the opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
that <hi>Confession of sins is</hi> (if there be need) <hi>to be made
to God alone.</hi> But this I shall prove with firmer testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
not many,<note place="margin">Epist. Canon. ad Letorum.</note> but pregnant, clear and undeniable.</p>

and therefore he interposes his judgment thus. <hi>[But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
these things, because this is praetermitted by the
Fathers, I do think it sufficient to cure the affections of
Covetousness with the publick word of doctrine, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
curing the diseases, as it were, of repletion by
the Word.</hi> That is plainly thus: The sins of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
had no Canonical Penances impos'd upon them:
and therefore many persons thought but little of them:
therefore, to cure this evil, let this sin be reprov'd in
publick Sermons, though there be no imposition of
publick penances. So that here is a Remedy without
Penances, a Cure without Confession, a publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
instead of a publick or private Judicatory.</p>
                  <p>But the fact of <hi>Nectarius</hi> in abrogating the publick
penitentiary-Priest upon the occasion of a scandal, does
bear much weight in this Question. I shall not repeat
the story; who please, may read it in <hi>Socrates, Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Epiphanius, Cassiodore,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus;</hi> and it is
known every where.<note place="margin">Relect. de poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. part. 5. Sect.</note> Only they who are pinch'd by it,
endeavour to confound it, as <hi>Waldensis</hi> and <hi>Canus;</hi>
some by denying it,<note place="margin">Ad sextum. p. 31. edit. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manticae. 1563. per Matthiam Gartium.</note> as <hi>Latinus Latinius;</hi> others by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
concerning every thing in it; some saying, that
<hi>Nectarius</hi> abrogated Sacramental Confession; others,
that he abrogated the publick only, so very many say:
and a third sort (who yet speak with most probability,)
that he only took away the office of the publick Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary,
which was instituted in the time of <hi>Decius,</hi>
and left things as that Decree found them; that is, that
those who had sin'd those sins which were noted in the
Penitential Canons, should confess them to the Bishop, or
in the face of the Church, and submit themselves to the
Canonical penances. This pass'd into the office of the
publick Penitentiary; and that into nothing, in the <hi>Greek</hi>


                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:64671:187"/>
Church. But there is nothing of this that I insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but I put the stress of this Question upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of this. For <hi>Eudaemon</hi> gave counsel to <hi>Nectarius</hi>
and he followed it, that he took away the penitentiary
Priest,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>ut liberam daret potestatem utì pro suâ quisque

liberum permitteret, prout sibi ipse conscius esset
&amp; confideret, ad mysteriorum Communionem accedere,
poenitentiarium illum Presbyterum exauthoravit.</hi> Now
if <hi>Nectarius</hi> by this Decree took away Sacramental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
(as the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors call it) then it is a clear
case, the Greek Church did not believe it necessary;
if it was onely the publick Confession they abolished,
then, for ought appears, there was no other at that
time; I mean, none commanded, none under any law,
or under any necessity: but whatever it was that was
abolished, private Confession did not by any decree
succeed in the place of it; but every man was left to
his liberty, and the dictates of his own Conscience, and
according to his own persuasion, to his fears or his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
so to come and partake of the Divine myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
All which is a plain demonstration, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
nothing of the necessity of Confession to a Priest
of all their sins, before they came to the holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And in pursuance of this, are those many Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and discourses of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who succeeding
<hi>Nectarius,</hi> by his publick doctrine could best inform
us how they understood the consequence of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and of this whole Question. The summe of
whole doctrine is this; It is not necessary to have
your sins revealed, or brought in publick, not onely
in the Congregation, but not to any one, but to God
alone.<note place="margin">Homil. 56. si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve 8. de Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. tom. 1.</note>

when he was but a Priest under <hi>Flavianus</hi> his Bishop;
and his Homilies on S. <hi>Matthew;</hi> besides this, it is plain
that he not onely speaks against the publick judicial
Penance and Confession; but against all, except that
alone which is made to God; allowing the sufficiency of
this for pardon, and disallowing the necessity of all
other. To these things <hi>Bellarmine, Perron, Petrus de Soto,

their answers fit the testimonies; as is evident to
them that compare the one and the other, the chief of
which I have remark'd, in passing by. The best An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers

                  </p>
                  <p>I do not deny, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors do bring many
sayings of the Greek and Latine Fathers, shewing the
usefulness of Confession to a Priest, and exhorting and
pressing men to it: But their arts are notorious, and
evident; and what (according to the discipline of the
Church at that time) they spake in behalf of the
<hi>Exomologesis</hi> or publick discipline, that these Doctors
translate to the private Confession; and yet what ever
we bring out of Antiquity against the necessity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to a Priest, that they will resolvedly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
onely of the publick. But, besides what hath
been said to every of the particulars, I shall conclude
this point with the sayings of some eminent men of
their own, who have made the same observation. <hi>In

which, so far as we conjecture, was bred out of the (old)
<hi>Exomologesis,</hi> by the unconstrained piety of men. For
we do not find it at all commanded of old.</p>
                  <p>The Conclusion of these Premises is this, That the
old Ecclesiastick discipline being pass'd into desuetude
and indevotion, the Latine Church especially, kept up
some little broken planks of it; which so long as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and devotion were warm, and secular interest had
not turn'd religion into arts, did in some good measure
supply the want of the old better discipline; but
when it had degenerated into little forms, and yet was
found to serve great ends of power, wealth, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it pass'd into new doctrines, and is now bold to
pretend to divine institution, though it be nothing but
the Commandment of men, a snare of Consciences, and
a ministery of humane policy; false in the Proposition,
and intolerable in the Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>There are divers other instances reducible to this
charge, and especially the Prohibition of Priests mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and the abstinence from flesh at certain times;
which are grown up from humane-Ordinances to be
established Doctrines, that is, to be urged with greater
severity than the Laws of God; insomuch that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> permits Concubinate and Stews at
the same time when she will not permit chaste Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
to her Clergy. And for abstinence from flesh at
times appointed, <hi>Veluti parricida penè dixerim rapitur

that discourse may remain a sufficient reproof of

The first testimony I brought, is the confession of a

these <hi>Hostiensis</hi> and <hi>Biel</hi> were the most noted. But <hi>Biel</hi>
was soon made to alter his opinion; <hi>Hostiensis</hi> did not,
that I find.</p>
                  <p>The other answer is, by <hi>E. W.</hi> That <hi>Roffensis saith it
not so absolutely, but with this interrogation. Quis jam de
indulgentiis mirari potest?</hi> Who now can wonder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Indulgences? Wonder! at what? for <hi>E. W.</hi>
is loth to tell it: But <hi>truth must out. Who now can won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that in the begining of the Church there was no use of
Indulgences?</hi> So <hi>Roffensis;</hi> which first supposes this;
that in the Primitive Church there was no use of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences;
none at all: And this which is the main
question here, is as absolutely affirm'd as any thing;
it is like a praecognition to a scientifical discourse. And
then the question having presuppos'd this, does by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
implication say, it is no wonder that there should
be then no use of Indulgences. That is, it not only
absolutely affirms the thing, but by consequence, the
notoreity of it and the reasonableness. Nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
or denies more strongly than a question. <hi>Are not
my ways equal,</hi> said God, <hi>and are not your ways unequal?</hi> that
is, It is evident and notorious that it is so. And by this
we understand the meaning of <hi>Roffensis;</hi> in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words <hi>[Yet (as they say) there was some very Ancient


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64671:191"/>
use of them among the Romans.] They say,</hi> that is, there
is a talk of it amongst some or other; but such they
were, whom <hi>Roffensis</hi> believ'd not; and that, upon
which they did ground their fabulous report, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a ridiculous legend,<note place="margin">Dissuasive. 1. part. Sect. 3.</note> which I have already
confuted.</p>
                  <p>The same doctrine is taught by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that concerning them we have nothing expresly
either in the Scriptures, or in the sayings of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Doctors.] And that he said so cannot be denied;
but <hi>E. W.</hi> says, that I omit what <hi>Antoninus</hi> addes [That
is] I did not transcribe his whole book. But what is it
that I should have added? This. <hi>Quamvis ad hoc indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur
illud Apostoli. 2 Cor. 2. Si quid donavi vobis, propter
vos in persona Christi.</hi> Now to this there needs no answer,
but this; that it is nothing to the purpose. To whom
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> forgave any thing; to the same person
S. <hi>Paul</hi> for their sakes did forgive also. But what
then; Therefore the Pope and his Clergy have power
to take off the temporal punishments which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
upon sinners after he hath forgiven them the
temporal? and that the Church hath power to forgive
sins before hand, and to set a price upon the basest
crimes and not to forgive, but to sell Indulgences? and
lay up the supernumerary treasures of the Saints good
works, and issue them out by retail in the Market of
Purgatory? Because S. <hi>Paul</hi> caus'd the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to
be absolved and restored to the Churches peace after a
severe penance; so great, that the poor man was in
danger of being swallowed up with despair and the
subtleties of Sathan; does this prove that therefore
all penances may be taken off when there is no such
danger, no such pious and charitable consideration?
And yet besides the inconsequence of all this; S. <hi>Paul</hi>
gave no indulgence, but what the Christian Church of
<hi>Corinth</hi> (in which at that time there was no Bishop) did


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64671:192"/>
first give themselves. Now the Indulgence which the
people give will prove but little warrant to what the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends; not only for the former
reasons, but also because the Primitive Church had
said nothing expresly concerning Indulgences; and
therefore did not to any such purpose expound the
words of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> but also because <hi>Antoninus</hi> himself
was not moved by those words to think they meant any
thing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Indulgences; but mentions it as
the argument of other persons. Just as if I should
write that there is concerning Transubstantiation no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
expresly said in the Scriptures, or in the writings
of the Ancient Fathers; although <hi>Hoc est corpus meum</hi>
be brought in for it: Would any man in his wits say,
that I am of the opinion that in Scripture there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
express for it, though I expresly deny it? I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not.</p>
                  <p>It appears now that <hi>Roffensis</hi> and <hi>a Castro</hi> declared
against the Antiquity of Indulgences; Their own
words are the witnesses; and the same is also true of
<hi>Antoninus;</hi> and therefore the first discourse of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
[in the Dissuasive] might have gone on prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
and needed not to have been interrupted. For
if these quotations be true as is pretended, and as now
appears, there is nothing by my Adversaries said in defence
of Indulgences, no pretence of an argument
in justification of them; the whole matter is so foul,
and yet so notorious that the novelty of it is plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged
by their most learned men and but faintly
denied by the bolder people that care not what they
say. So that I shall account the main point of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
to be (for ought yet appears to the contrary)
gain'd against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is another appendant Question that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in by the by; nothing to the main inquiry, but a
particular instance of the usual ways of <hi>earning Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64671:192"/>
viz.</hi> by going <hi>in pilgrimages;</hi> which very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I affirmed to be reproved by the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
and particularly by S. <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> in a
book or Epistle of his written wholly on this subject,
(so I said) and so <hi>Possevine</hi> calls it, <hi>librum contra pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinationes;</hi>
the book against Pilgrimages. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
is large and learned and greatly dissuasive of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
from going in Pilgrimage to <hi>Jerusalem. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
profectionem in Hierosylma inter recte facta quae eo
(viz. ad regni coelorum haereditatem consequendam) diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
non enumeravit; ubi beatitudinem annunciat, tale
studium, talemque operam non est complexus. And again,
spiritualem noxam affricat accuratum vitae genus insisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.
Non est ista tanto digna studio, imo est vitanda
summo opere.</hi> And if this was directed principally to
such persons, who had chosen to live a solitary and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

persons where those, whose false shew of piety
he did in that instance reprove; but he reproves it by
such arguments all the way, as concern all Christians,
but especially women; and answers to an objection
made against himself for going; which he says he did by
command, and public charge, and for the service of
the <hi>Arabian</hi> Churches, and that he might confer with
the Bishops of <hi>Palestine.</hi> This Epistle of S. <hi>Gregory
Nyssen de adeuntibus Hierosolymam</hi> was printed at <hi>Paris</hi>
in Greek by <hi>Guilielmus Morellus,</hi> and again published in
Greek and Latin with a double version by <hi>Peter du

and therefore there is no denying the truth
of the quotation; the Author of the letter had better

it been ever the worse? But though I did not, yet
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> quoted <hi>Moses,</hi> and that it seems troubled
this Gentleman. But S. <hi>Bernards</hi> words are indeed
agreeable to the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> but not all out the
same: For <hi>Moses</hi> made no prohibition of going to

                  </p>
                  <p>There remains in <hi>A. L.</hi> yet one cavil, but it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of diligence and not to the point in hand. The
authority of S. <hi>Austin</hi> I mark'd under the title of his
Sermon <hi>de Martyribus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 25.</note> But the Gentleman to shew


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64671:193"/>
his Learning tells us plainly that <hi>there is but one in</hi>
S. Austins <hi>works with that title, to wit his 117. Sermon de
diversis, and in that there is not the least word to any such
purpose.</hi> All this latter part may be true, but the
first is a great mistake; for if the Gentleman please to
look in the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition of S. <hi>Austin 1571. tom. 10.
pag. 277.</hi> he shall find the words I have quoted. And
whereas he talkes of 117. Sermons <hi>de diversis,</hi> and of
one only Sermon <hi>de martyribus,</hi> I do a little wonder at
him to talk so confidently; whereas in the Edition I
speak of, and which I followed, there are but 49. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and 17. under the title <hi>de diversis,</hi> and yet there
are six Sermons that bear the title <hi>de Martyribus,</hi> but
they are to be found under the title <hi>de Sanctis;</hi> so that
the Gentleman look'd in the wrong place for his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and if he had not mistaken himself he could
have had no colour for an objection. But for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Reader; the words are these in his 3. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>de Martyribus diversis. Non dixit vade in orientem
&amp; quaere justitiam, naviga usque ad occidentem ut acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias
indulgentiam. Dimitte inimico tuo &amp; dimittetur

But now let it be considered that all those charges
which are laid against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her
greatest Doctors respectively in the matter of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
are found to be true; and if so, let the world
judge whether that doctrine and those practices be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
in a Christian Church.</p>
                  <p>But that the Reader may not be put off with a mere
defence of four quotations; I shall add this; that I
might have instanc'd in worse matters made by the
Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the pious works, the condition of
obtaining Indulgences. Such as was the Bull of Pope
<hi>Julius</hi> the second, giving Indulgence to him that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64671:194"/>
a <hi>Frenchman</hi> should kill him, and another for the
killing of a <hi>Venetian.</hi> But we need not to wonder at
it, since according to the doctrine of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,
We ought to say that in the Pope is the fulness of all graces;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De regimine principum l. 3. c. 10. inter opuscula. num. 20.</note>
                     <hi>because he alone bestows a full Indulgence of all our sins; so
that what we say of our chief Prince and Lord</hi> (viz. <hi>Jesus
Christ) does fit him, for we all have received of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
Which words besides that they are horrid blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy;
are also a fit principle of the doctrine and
use of Indulgences to those purposes, and in that
evil manner we complain of in the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I desire this only instance may be added to it, that
P. <hi>Paul</hi> the third, he that conven'd the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> the third, for fear (as I may suppose)
the Council should forbid any more such follies, for a
farewell to this game gave an Indulgence to the Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Sacrament of the Altar,<note place="margin">Impress. Paris per Philippum Hotot. 1550.</note> or of the Blessed
Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, of such a vastness and
unreasonable folly, that it puts us beyond the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion, to an inquiry whether it were not done
either in perfect distraction, or with a worse design to
make Religion to be ridiculous, and expose it to a
contempt and scorn. The <hi>conditions</hi> of the Indulgence
are either to visit the Church of S. <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Charters,</hi>
to say a <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> and an <hi>Ave Mary</hi> every Friday,
or at most to be present at processions and other Divine
Service upon <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day. The gift is as many
priviledges, indults, exemptions, liberties, immunities,
plenary pardon of sins and other spiritual graces as
were given to the Fraternity of the Image of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<hi>ad Sancta Sanctorum;</hi> the Fraternity of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and great Hospital of S. <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Augusta</hi> of
S. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> of St. <hi>Cosmus</hi> and <hi>Damianus;</hi> of the
<hi>Florentine</hi> Nation, of the Hospital of the Holy Ghost
in <hi>Saxia,</hi> of the order of S. <hi>Austin</hi> and S. <hi>Champ,</hi> of


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64671:194"/>
the Fraternities of the said City; of the Churches of
our Lady <hi>de populo &amp; de verbo:</hi> and all those which were
ever given to them that visited these Churches; or
those which should be ever given hereafter. A pretty
large gift. In which there were so many pardons, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pardons, half pardons, true pardons, plenary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
Quarentaines, and years of Quarentaines; that
it is a harder thing to number them, than to purchase
them. I shall remark in these some particulars fit to
be considered.</p>
                  <p>1. That a most scandalous and unchristian dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and death of all Ecclesiastical discipline, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to the making all sin so cheap and trivial a
thing; that the horrible demerits and exemplary
punishment and remotion of scandal and satisfactions
to the Church are indeed reduc'd to trifling and Mock-penances.
He that shall send a servant with a Candle
to attend the Holy Sacrament when it shall be carried
to sick people, or shall go himself, or if he can neither
go nor send, if he say a <hi>Pater Noster</hi> and an <hi>Ave;</hi> he
shall have a hundred years of <hi>true pardon.</hi> This is fair
and easie. But then,</p>
                  <p>2. It would be considered what is meant by so many
years of pardon, and so many years of <hi>true pardon.</hi> I
know but of one natural interpretation of it; and that
it can mean nothing, but that some of the pardons are
but phantastical, and not true: and in this I find no
fault, save only that it ought to have been said; that
all of them are phantastical.</p>
                  <p>3. It were fit we learned how to compute four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and eight hundred years of Quarantaines; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of a third part of all their sins; for so much is
given to every Brother and Sister of this Fraternity,
upon <hi>Easter</hi> day and eight days after. Now if a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needs not thus many, it would be considered whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it do not encourage a Brother or a frail Sister to


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64671:195"/>
use all their Medicine and to sin more freely, lest so
great a gift become useless.</p>
                  <p>4. And this is so much the more considerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the gift is vast beyond all imagination. The first
four days in Lent they may purchase 33000 years of
pardon, besides a plenary remission of all his sins over
and above. The first week of Lent a hundred and three
and thirty thousand years of pardon, besides five ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
remissions of all their sins, and two third parts
besides, and the delivery of one soul out of Purgatory.
The second week in Lent a hundred and eight and fifty
thousand years of pardon besides the remission of all
their sins and a third part besides; and the delivery of
one soul. The third week in Lent, 80000 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a plenary remission, and the delivery of one soul
out of Purgatory. The fourth week in Lent; three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
thousand years of pardon besides a remission of
two thirds of all their sins; and one plenary remission
and one soul delivered. The fifth week 79000. years
of pardon and the deliverance of two souls, only the
2700. years that is given for the Sunday may be had
twice that day, if they will visit the Altar twice; and as
many Quarantaines. The sixth week 205000. years
besides Quarantaines; and four plenary pardons. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on <hi>Palme</hi> Sunday whose portion is 25000. years it
may be had twice that day. And all this is the price
of him that shall upon these days visit the Altar in the
Church of S. <hi>Hilary.</hi> And this runs on to the Fridays,
and many Festivals and other solemn days in the other
parts of the year.</p>
                  <p>5. Though it may be that a Brother may not need
all this; at least at that time, yet that there may be
no insecurity, the said Popes give to every Brother and
Sister of the Fraternity, plenary pardon and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of all their sins thrice in their life, upon what
day and hour they please. I suppose that one of the


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64671:195"/>
times shall be in the article of death; for that's the
surest way for a weak Brother.<note place="margin">Vide revie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Popes do not only give remission of sins already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but also of such as are to be committed. But
whether it be so or no; There is in the Bulls of this
Fraternity as good provision; for he, that hath a dormant
faculty for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a plenary pardon laying by him to be us'd
at what hour he please; hath a Bull before hand for
pardon of sins afterwards to be committed when he
hath a mind to it.</p>
                  <p>6. To what purpose is so much wast of the Treasure
of the Church? <hi>Quorsum perditio haec?</hi> Every Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Sister of this Fraternity may have for so many
times visiting the Altar aforesaid, fourteen or fifteen
plenary pardons. Certainly the Popes suppose these
persons to be mighty Criminals, that they need so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pardons, so many plenaries. But two <hi>Alls</hi> of the
same thing is as much as two <hi>Nothings.</hi> But if there
were not infinite causes of fear that very many of them
were nullities, and that none of them were of any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
avail, there could be no pretence of reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in dispensing these Jewels with so loose a hand,
and useless a freedom, as if a man did shovel Mustard,
or pour Hogsheads of Vinegar into his friends mouth,
to make him swallow a mouthful of Herbs.</p>
                  <p>7. What is the secret meaning of it, that in divers
clauses in their Bulls of Indulgences,<note place="margin">Bull. Julii. 3. de an. Jubilii.</note> they put in this
clause, A pardon of all their sins <hi>[be they never so hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous]</hi>
The extraordinary cases reserved to the Pope;
and the consequent difficulty of getting pardon of
such great sins, because it would cost much more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
was or might be some little restraint to some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from running easily into the most horrible impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but to give such a loose to this little, and this
last rein and curb; and by an easie Indulgence to take
off all, even the most heinous sins, what is it but to give


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64671:196"/>
the Devil an argument to tempt persons that have any
conscience or fear left, to throw off all fear, and to
stick at nothing.</p>
                  <p>8. It seems hard to give a reasonable account, what
is meant by giving a plenary pardon of all their sins;
and yet at the same time an Indulgence of 12000.
years, and as many Quarentaines; it seems the bounty
of the Church runs out of a Conduit, though the Vessels
be full, yet the water still continues running and goes
into wast.</p>
                  <p>9. In this great heap of Indulgences (and so it is in
very many other) power is given to a Lay Sister or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to free a soul from Purgatory. But if this be so
easily granted, the necessity of Masses will be very
little; what need is there to give greater fees to a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
when a sick person may be cur'd with a Posset
and Pepper. The remedy of the way of Indulgences is
cheap and easie, a servant with a Candle, a <hi>Pater</hi> and
an <hi>Ave,</hi> a going to visit an Altar, wearing the Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> or the Chord of S. <hi>Francis:</hi> but
Masses for souls are a dear commodity, five pence or
six pence is the least a Mass will cost in some places;
nay it will stand in nine pence in other places. But
then if the Pope can do this trick certainly, then what
can be said to <hi>John Gersons</hi> question.

put into the Margent because
they are many; the sense of
them is this. 1. He finds no use
of Indulgences before the stations
of S. <hi>Gregory;</hi> the consequent of
that is, that all the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers
did not receive them before S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi>
time; and therefore they did
not receive them altogether. 2. The
matter being so obscure, <hi>Polydore</hi>
chose to express his sense in the
testimony of <hi>Roffensis.</hi> 3. From him
he affirms, that the use of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64671:197"/>
is but new, and lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
amongst Christians. 4. That
there is no certainty concerning
their original. 5. They report,
that amongst the Ancient Latins
there was some use of them. But
it is but a report, for he knows nothing of it before
S. <hi>Gregories</hi> time, and for that also he hath but a meer
report. 6. Amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> it is not to this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.
7. As long as there was no care of Purgatory,
no man look'd after Indulgences; because if you take
away Purgatory, there is no need of Indulgences.
8. That the use of Indulgences began after men had a
while trembled at the torments of Purgatory.] This
if I understand Latin or common sense, is the doctrine
of <hi>Polydore Virgil;</hi> and to him I add also the testimony
of <hi>Alphonsus a Castro.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 8. verb. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul. vide etiam lib. 12. lil. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorium.</note>

potissimum apud Graecos scriptores. Qua de causa usque
hodiernum diem purgatorium non est a Graecis creditum.</hi>
The consequent of these things is this. If Purgatory
was not known to the Primitive Church; if it was but
lately known to the Catholic Church; if the Fathers
seldom or never make mention of it; If in the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church especially there was so great silence of it, that
to this very day it is not believed amongst the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
then this doctrine was not an Apostolical doctrine, not
Primitive, not Catholic, but an Innovation and of
yesterday.</p>
                  <p>And this is of it self (besides all these confessions of
their own parties) a suspicious matter, because the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does establish their doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
upon the Ancient use of the Church of praying
for the dead. But this consequence of theirs is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vain; because all the Fathers did pray for the dead,
yet they never prayed for their deliverance out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
nor ever meant it. To this it is thus objected,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64671:198"/>
It is confessed that they <hi>prayed for them that God would
shew them a mercy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">E. W. <hi>Truth will out.</hi> cap. 3. pag. 23.</note> Now, <hi>Mark well, If they be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
they have a mercy, the sentence is given for Eternal
happiness. If in Hell, they are wholly destitute of mercy;
unless there be a third place where mercy can be shewed
them.]</hi> I have according to my order <hi>mark't it well;</hi> but
find nothing in it to purpose. For though the Fathers
prayed for the souls departed that God would shew
them mercy; yet it was, that God would shew them
mercy in the day of judgment, <hi>In that formidable and
dreadful day, then there is need of much mercy unto us,</hi>
saith S. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> And methinks this Gentleman
should not have made use of so pitiful an argument,
and would not, if he had consider'd that S. <hi>Paul</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for <hi>Onesiphorus, that God would shew him a mercy in
that day;</hi> that is in the day of judgment, as generally
interpreters Ancient and Modern do understand it,
and particularly S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> now cited. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
departed are in the hands of Christ as soon as they
die, and they are very well; and the souls of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
are where it pleases God to appoint them to be, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by a fearful expectation of the revelation of
the day of judgment; but heaven and hell are reserved
till the day of judgment;<note place="margin">Vers. 6.</note> and the Devils themselves are
<hi>reserved in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the
great day,</hi> saith S. <hi>Jude;</hi> and in that day they shall be
sentenc'd, and so shall all the wicked, to everlasting
fire, which as yet is but prepar'd for the Devil and his
Angels for ever. But is there no mercy to be shewed
to them unless they be in Purgatory? Some of the
Ancients speak of visitation of Angels to be imparted
to the souls departed; and the hastening of the day of
judgment is a mercy; and the avenging of the Martyrs
upon their adversaries is a mercy for which the <hi>souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Altar pray,</hi> saith S. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation:</hi> and
the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers speak of a fiery trial at the day of


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64671:198"/>
judgment through which every one must pass; and
there will be great need of mercy. And after all this;
there is a remission of sins proper to this world, when
God so pardons that he gives the grace of repentance,
that he takes his judgements off from us, that he gives
us his holy spirit to mortifie our sins, that he admits
us to work in his laboratory, that he sustains us by his
power, and promotes us by his grace, and stands by
us favourably while we work out our salvation with fear
and trembling; and at last he crowns us with perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
But at the day of Judgment there shall be a
pardon of sins, that will crown this pardon; when
God shall pronounce us pardon'd before all the world;
and when Christ shall actually and praesentially rescue
us from all the pains which our sins have deserved;
even from everlasting pain: And that's the final par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for which till it be accomplished, all the faithful
do night and day pray incessantly: although to many
for whom they do pray, they friendly believe that it is
now certain, that they shall then be glorified. <hi>Saepissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

Gentleman talking that in Heaven all is remitted, and
in Hell nothing is forgiven, and from hence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that there is no avoiding of purgatory; is too
hasty a conclusion: let him stay till he comes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the final sentence is past, and then he will
(if he finds it to be so) have reason to say what he does;
but by that time the dream of Purgatory will be out;


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64671:199"/>
and in the mean time let him strive to understand his
Mass-book better. S. <hi>Austin</hi> thought he had reason to
pray for pardon and remission for his Mother; for the
reasons already expressed, though he never thought
his Mother was in Purgatory. It was upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the dangers of every soul that dies in <hi>Adam;</hi>
and yet he affirms she was even before her death alive
unto Christ. And therefore she did not die miserable,
nor did she die at all (said her son,)<note place="margin">Confess. lib. 9. cap. 12. &amp; 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Hoc &amp; documentis
ejus morum, &amp; fide non ficta, rationibus certis teneba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi>
and when he did pray for her; <hi>Credo jam feceris
quod te rogo, sed voluntaria oris mei approba Domine:</hi>
which will yet give another answer to this confident
Gentleman; S. <hi>Austin</hi> prayed for pardon for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and did believe the thing was done already; but
he prayed to God to approve that voluntary oblation
of his mouth. So that now all the objection is vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
S. <hi>Austin</hi> prayed (besides many other reasons) to
manifest his kindness, not for any need she had. But
after all this, was not S. <hi>Monica</hi> a Saint? Is she not
put in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar, and the fourth of <hi>May</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for her festival? And do Saints, do Canoniz'd
persons use to go to Purgatory? But let it be as it will,
I only desire that this be remembred against a good
time; that here it is confessed that prayers were offered
for a Saint departed. I fear it will be denied by and by.</p>
                  <p>But 2. The Fathers made prayers for those who by
the confession of all sides never were in Purgatory;
for <hi>the Patriarchs, Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. and especially for the
<hi>Blessed Virgin Mary;</hi> this which is a direct and perfect
overthrow of the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine of Purgatory, and
therefore if it can be made good, they have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
left, upon the confidence of which they can
plausibly pretend to Purgatory. I have already offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

observing where <hi>Durantus</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors are
mistaken, and with what boldness they say, that <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
for them is only <hi>giving thanks,</hi> and that the <hi>Greek</hi>

Prayers; I thought it fit first to reprove that initial
error, <hi>viz. [that Communicantes, &amp; offerentes pro san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis
is not Prayer;]</hi> and then to make it clear that they
did really pray, <hi>for mercy, for pardon, for a place of rest,
for eternal glory for them</hi> who never were in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for it is a great ignorance to suppose, that when it
is said <hi>the sacrifice or oblation is offered,</hi> it must mean
only thanksgiving. For it is called in S. <hi>Dionys,</hi>

the third we shall find this well expounded, <hi>prosit huic

but the offering it self was not Eucharistical but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precatory.
And so it is also in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Liturgy
publish'd at <hi>Crackow: per hanc etiam oblationem da aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
pacem omnibus qui nos praecesserunt in fide Christi,
sanctis Patribus, Patriarchis, Apostolis, Prophetis,
Martyribus,</hi> &amp;c. which testimony does not only evince,
that the offering sacrifices and oblations for the Saints,
did signifie praying for them; but that this they did
for all Saints whatsoever. And concerning S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 6. biblioth. Annot. 47.</note>
that which <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> says is material to this

Apostles and Martyrs, but that they intended to do so,
when they offered the Sacramental oblations; and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferimus</hi>
is <hi>offerimus tibi preces.</hi> Now since it is so, I
had advantage enough in the confession of their own
<hi>Durantus,</hi> that he acknowledged so much, that the
Church offered sacrifice for Saints. Now though he
presently kick'd this down with his foot, and denied
that they prayed for Saints departed; I shall yet more
clearly convince him and all the <hi>Roman</hi> contradictors
of their bold and unreasonable error in this affair.
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> is the first I mentioned as a witness,<note place="margin">Haeres. 75.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I cited no words of his, and my adversaries have
cited them for me, but imperfectly, and left out the
words where the argument lies, I shall set them down
at length. <q>

&amp;c. We make mention of the just and of sinners, for


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64671:200"/>
sinners that we may implore the mercy of God for
them. For the just, the Fathers, the Patriarchs,
the Prophets, Evangelists and Martyrs, Confessors,
Bishops and Anachorets, that prosecuting the Lord
Jesus Christ with a singular honour, we separate
these from the rank of other men, and give due wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to his Divine Majesty, while we account that he
is not to be made equal to mortal men, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
although
they had a thousand times more righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
than they have.]</q> Now first here is mention
made of all in their prayers and oblations, and yet no
mention made that the Church prays for one sort,
and only gives thanks for the other,<note place="margin">Letter pag. 10. Truth will out, pag. 25.</note> (as these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the objectors falsely pretend.) But here is a
double separation made of the righteous departed; one
is from the worser sort of sinners, the other from the
most righteous Saviour. True it is, they believ'd
they had more need to pray for some than for others;
but if they did not pray for all, when they made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all, how did they honour Christ by separating
their condition from his? Is it not lawful to give
thanks for the life and death, for the resurrection, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and glorification of Christ? And if the Church
only gave thanks for the departed Saints, and did not
pray for mercy for them too, how are not the Saints
in this made equal to Christ? So that I think the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is clear and pertinent:<note place="margin">In Psal. 36. Conc. 2. To. 8. p. 120.</note> To
which greater light is given by the words of S. <hi>Austin,
Who is he for whom no man prays, but only he who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
for all men? viz.</hi> our <hi>Blessed Lord.</hi> And there is
more light yet, by the example of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> who
though he did most certainly believe his Mother to be
a Saint, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes so too, yet he
prayed for pardon for her. Now by this it was that
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> separated Christ from the Saints departed,


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64671:201"/>
for he could not mean any thing else; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was then writing against <hi>Aerius</hi> who did not
deny it to be lawful to give God thanks for the Saints
departed, but affirm'd it to be needless to pray for
them, <hi>viz.</hi> he must mean this of the Churches praying
for all her dead, or else he had said nothing against his
adversary, or for his own cause.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Cyril</hi> (though he be confidently denied to have

                     <hi>for which
is offered the obsecration of the holy and dreadful sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.]</hi>
If S. <hi>Cyril</hi> means what his words signifie, then
the Church did pray for departed Saints; for they
prayed for all the departed Fathers and Bishops, it is
hard if amongst them there were no Saints: but suppose
that, yet if there were any Saints at all that died out
of the militant Church, yet the case is the same; for
they prayed for all the departed: And 2. They offered
the dreadful sacrifice for them all. 3. They offered
it for all in the way of prayer. 4. And they believed
this to be a great help to souls. Now unless the souls
of all Saints that died then, went to Purgatory (which
I am sure the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors dare not own) the case is
plain that prayer, and not thanksgivings only were
offered by the Ancient Church for souls, who by the
Confession of all sides never went to Purgatory; and
therefore praying for the dead is but a weak argument
to prove Purgatory. <hi>Nicolaus Cabasilas</hi> hath an evasion
from all this; as he supposes, for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the word
us'd in the memorials of Saints, does not alwayes sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>praying for one,</hi> but it may signifie <hi>giving of thanks;</hi>
This is true, but it is to no purpose; for when ever it is
said <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> we pray for such a one, that must
signifie to pray for, and not to give thanks, and that's


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64671:201"/>
our present case: and therefore no escape here can be
made; the words of S. <hi>Cyril</hi> are very plain.</p>
                  <p>The third allegation is of the Canon of the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
which is so plain, evident and notorious, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
even by these Gentlemen the objectors, that I
will be tried by the words which the Author of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acknowledges. So it is in the Liturgy of S. <hi>James,
Remember all Orthodox from Abel the just unto this day,
make them to rest in the land of the living, in thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the delights of Paradise.</hi> Thus far this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
quoted S. <hi>James,</hi> and I wonder that he shall urge
a conclusion manifestly contrary to his own allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Did all the Orthodox from <hi>Abel</hi> to that day go
to Purgatory? Certainly <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and
<hi>Elias,</hi> and the Blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> did not, and S. <hi>Stephen</hi>
did not, and the Apostles that died before this Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
was made did not, and yet the Church prayed for
all Orthodox, <hi>prayed that they might rest in the land of
the living,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore they prayed for such which
by the confession of all sides never went to Purgatory.
In the other Liturgies also, the Gentleman sets down
words enough to confute himself, as the Reader may
see in the letter if it be worth the reading. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he sets down what he list, and makes breaches
and Rabbet holes to pop in as he please, I shall for the
satisfaction of the Reader set down the full sense
and practice of the <hi>Greek</hi> Canon in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                  <p>And first for S. <hi>James</hi> his Liturgy,<note place="margin">Biblioth. Sanct. 1. 6. Annot. 345<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sect. Jacob. Apostolus.</note> which, being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

                  </p>

the right word of faith, and namely, of</hi> Ignatius,

the very Martyrs. <hi>O Lord remember them who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
(or stood) unto blood for religion, and have fed thy
holy flock with righteousness and holiness.]</hi> Certainly
this is not giving of thanks for them, or praying to
them, but a direct praying for them, even for holy
Bishops, Confessors, Martyrs, that God (meaning
in much mercy) would remember them, that is, make
them to rest in the bosom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the region of
the living, as S. <hi>James</hi> expresses it.</p>
                  <p>And in the Liturgies of the Churches of <hi>Egypt</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to S. <hi>Basil, Greg. Naz.</hi> and S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> the
Churches pray; <q>[Be mindful O Lord of thy Saints,

                  </p>
                  <p>Of the same spirit were all the Ancient Liturgies or

                        <hi>Let us pray to

And again, [moreover we offer unto thee this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

please, the <hi>Greek</hi> Mass of S. <hi>Peter:</hi> 
                     <q>To them, O
Lord, and to all that rest in Christ, we pray that
thou indulge a place of refreshing light and peace.]</q>
So that nothing is clearer than that in the <hi>Greek</hi> Canon
they prayed for the souls of the best of all the Saints,
whom yet because no man believes they ever were in
Purgatory; it follows that prayer for the dead us'd by
the Ancients does not prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>To these add the doctrine and practice of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Fathers:<note place="margin">Eccles. hier. Cap. 7. in theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</note>

<hi>Now, O Lord, receive Caesarius.</hi> I hope I have said
enough concerning the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, their doctrine
and practice in this particular: and I desire it may be
observed, that there is no greater testimony of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of a Church than their Liturgy. Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
may have private opinions which are not against
the doctrine of the Church; but what is put into their
publick devotions, and consign'd in their Liturgies,
no man scruples it, but it is the confession and religion
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But now that I may make my Reader some amends
for his trouble in reading the trifling objections of
these <hi>Roman</hi> adversaries, and my defences; I shall also
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for the greater conviction of my Adversaries shew, that
they would not have oppos'd my affirmation in this
particular, if they had understood their own Mass-book,
for it was not only thus from the beginning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
now in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, but it is so to this very
day in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. In the old <hi>Latin Missal</hi> we
have this prayer,<note place="margin">Missa latina Antiqua edit. Argentinae. 1557. pag. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>[Suscipe sancta Trinitas hanc oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

perennis requiem habeant, &amp; à poenis impiorum segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati
semper in tuae laudis laetitia perseverent.</hi> And in
the very Canon of the Mass, which these Gentlemen I
suppose (if they be Priests) cannot be ignorant in any
part of, they pray, <hi>Memento Domine famulorum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularumque
tuarum qui nos praecesserunt cum signo fidei,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64671:203"/>
&amp; dormiunt in somno pacis. Ipsis Domine &amp; omnibus in
Christo quiescentibus, locum refrigerii, lucis &amp; pacis, ut
indulgeas deprecamur.</hi> Unless all that are at rest in
Christ go to Purgatory, it is plain that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> prays for Saints, who by the confession of all
sides never were in Purgatory. I could bring many
more testimonies if they were needful; but I summ up
this particular with the words of S. <hi>Austin:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De curapto mortuis, cap. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Non sunt
praetermittendae supplicationes pro spiritibus mortuorum;
quas faciendas pro omnibus in Christiana &amp; Catholica so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietate
defunctis etiam tacitis nominibus quorumque, sub
generali commemoratione suscepit Ecclesia.</hi> The Church
prays for all persons that died in the Christian and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
faith. And therefore I wonder how it should
drop from S. <hi>Austins</hi> pen,<note place="margin">De verbis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postoli Serm. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Injuriam facit Martyri qui
orat pro Martyre.</hi> But I suppose he meant it only in
case the prayer was made for them, as if they were in
an uncertain state, and so it is probable enough, but
else his words were not only against himself in other
places, but against the whole practice of the ancient
Catholic Church. I remember that when it was
ask'd of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> by the Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sacramentari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Gregor. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquum.</note> why
the prayer that was in the old Missal for the soul of
Pope <hi>Leo; Annue nobis Domine, animae famuli tui Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis
haec profit oblatio,</hi> it came to be chang'd into <hi>Annue
nobis Domine ut intercessione famuli tui Leonis haec profit
oblatio;</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> answered him, that who
chang'd it or when, he knew not, but he knew how,
that is, he knew the reason of it, because <hi>the authority
of the Holy Scripture said,</hi> he <hi>does injury to a Martyr that
prays for a Martyr,</hi> the same thing is to be done for the
like reason concerning all other Saints.] The good
man had heard the saying somewhere, but being
little us'd to the Bible, he thought it might be there,
because it was a pretty saying. However though this
change was made in the Mass-books, and <hi>prayer for the


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64671:204"/>
soul of</hi> S. Leo, <hi>was chang'd into a prayer to S.</hi> Leo<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Missal. Roman. Paris 1529.</note>;
and the Doctors went about to defend it as well as they
could,<note place="margin">Cap. cum Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae. Extrav. de celebrat Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarum in Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lâ.</note> yet because they did it so pitifully, they had
reason to be asham'd of it; and in the Missal reformed
by order of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it is put out again,
and the prayer for S. <hi>Leo</hi> put in again<note n="*" place="margin">Missale Rom. in decreto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Trid. restit. in festo S. Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note>, <hi>That by
these offices of holy atonement (viz.</hi> the celebration of the
Holy Sacrament) <hi>a blessed reward may accompany him,
and the gifts of thy grace may be obtain'd for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Another argument was us'd in the Dissuasive,
against the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine of Purgatory, <hi>viz.</hi> How
is Purgatory a Primitive and Catholick doctrine,
when generally the <hi>Greek</hi> and many of the <hi>Latin</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
taught, that the souls departed in some exterior
place expect the day of judgment, but that no soul
enters into the supreme heaven, or the place of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
bliss till the day of judgment; but at that day, say
many of them, all must pass through the universal fire.
To these purposes respectively the words of very many
Fathers are brought by <hi>Sixtus Senensis;</hi> to all which
being so evident and apparent, the Gentlemen that
write against the Dissuasive are pleas'd not to say one
word,<note place="margin">Letter to a friend, pag. 12.</note> but have left the whole fabric of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to shift for it self against the battery of so great
authorities, only one of them, striving to find some
fault, says, that the Dissuader quotes <hi>Sixtus Senensis,</hi>
as saying, <hi>That Pope</hi> John <hi>the 22. not only taught and
declar'd the doctrine (that before the day of judgment the
souls of men are kept in certain receptacles) but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be held by all, as saith</hi> Adrian <hi>in 4. Sent. when</hi>
Sixtus Senensis <hi>saith not so of Pope</hi> John, <hi>&amp;c. but only
reports the opinion of others.</hi> To which I answer, that
I did not quote <hi>Senensis</hi> as saying any such thing of his
own authority. For besides that in the body of the
discourse there is no mention at all of <hi>John 22.</hi> in the
margent, also it is only said of <hi>Sixtus, Enumerat S. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobum


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64671:204"/>
Apostolum— &amp; Johannem Pontif. Rom.</hi> but I
add of my own afterwards, that Pope <hi>John</hi> not only
taught and declar'd that sentence,<note place="margin">And these are the words of <hi>Senensis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning P. <hi>John 22.</hi> and P. <hi>Adrian.</hi>
                     </note> but commanded it
to be held by all men, as saith <hi>Adrian.</hi> Now although
in his narrative of it, <hi>Adrian</hi> begins with <hi>novissime fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> it is reported, yet <hi>Senensis</hi> himself when he had
said, Pope <hi>John is said to have decreed this;</hi> he himself
adds that <hi>Ocham</hi> and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> are witnesses of this
decree. 2. <hi>Adrian</hi> is so far a witness of it, that he
gives the reason of the same, even because the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Paris</hi> refus'd to give promotion to them who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
or did refuse to promise for ever to cleave to that
opinion. 3. <hi>Ocham</hi> is so fierce a witness of it, that he
wrote against Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. for the opinion.
4. Though <hi>Senensis</hi> be not willing to have it believed;
yet all that he can say against it, is, that <hi>apud probatos
scriptores non est Undequaque certum.</hi> 5. Yet he brings
not one testimony out of antiquity, against this charge
against Pope <hi>John,</hi> only he says, that Pope <hi>Benedict</hi>
XI. affirms, that <hi>John</hi> being prevented by death could
not finish the decree. 6. But this thing was not done
in a corner, the acts of the University of <hi>Paris</hi> and
their fierce adhering to the decree were too notorious.
7. And after all this it matters not whether it be so or
no, when it is confessed that so many Ancient Fathers
expresly teach the doctrine contrary to the <hi>Roman,</hi> as
it is this day, and yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors are not
what they say, insomuch that S. <hi>Bernard</hi> having fully
and frequently taught, <hi>That no souls go to Heaven till
they all go, neither the Saints without the common people,
nor the spirit without the flesh; that there are three states
of souls, one in the tabernacles</hi> (viz. <hi>of our bodies) a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in</hi> atriis <hi>or outward Courts, and a third in the house
of God; Alphonsus à Castro</hi> admonishes that this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is damn'd; and <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> adds these words,
<hi>(which thing also I do not deny) yet I suppose he ought to be


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64671:205"/>
excus'd ob ingentem numerum illustrium Ecclesiae patrum,</hi>
for the great number of the illustrious Fathers of the
Church,<note place="margin">Annot. 345.</note> who before by their testimony did seem to
give authority to this opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> But that the present doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
is but a new article of faith, is therefore certain,
because it was no article of faith in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time,
for he doubted of it. And to this purpose I quoted in
the margent two places of S. <hi>Austin.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Enchirid. cap. 68, 69.</note> The words I shall
now produce, because they will answer for themselves.
In the 68. chapter of his Manual to <hi>Laurentius</hi> he takes
from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> their best armour in which
they trusted,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> and expounds the words of S. <hi>Paul, he
shall be saved yet so as by fire]</hi> to mean only the loss of
such pleasant things as most delighted them in this
world. And in the beginning of the next chapter he
adds,<note place="margin">Tale aliquid etiam post hanc vitam fieri in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibile non est, &amp; utrum ita sit qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>[That such a thing may also be done after this life
is not incredible, and whether it be so or no it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,

or lie hid. Now what is that which thus may, or may
not be found out? This, that <hi>[some faithful by how

sooner or later they shall be sav'd by a certain Purgatory

only it may be inquir'd whether it be so or no. And
if these be not the words of <hi>doubting, [it is not incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
such a thing may be,</hi> it may be inquir'd <hi>after, it
may be found to be so, or it may never be found, but lie

of S.</hi> Austin <hi>does not relate to the matter</hi> or question

<q>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> whether or no that pain of being

the Purgatory flames?</q> (says <hi>E. W.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">E. W. pag. 28.</note>) A goodly
excuse! as if S. <hi>Austin</hi> had troubled himself with such
an impertinent Question, whether the poor souls in


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64671:205"/>
their infernal flames be not troubled that they left their
lands and mony behind them? Indeed it is possible
they might wish some of the waters of their springs or
fishponds to cool their tongues: but S. <hi>Austin</hi> surely
did not suspect that the tormented Ghosts were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
they had not brought their best cloaths with them,
and money in their purses; This is too pitiful and
strain'd an answer; the case being so evidently clear,
that the thing S. <hi>Austin</hi> doubted of was, since there
was to some of the faithful, who yet were too voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or covetous persons, a Purgatory in this world,
even the loss of their Goods which they so lov'd, and
therefore being lost so grieved for, whether or no they
should not also meet with another Purgatory after
death: that is, whether besides the punishment suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here, they should not be punish'd after death;
how? by grieving for the loss of their goods? Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous!
what then, S. <hi>Austin</hi> himself tells us, by <hi>so
much as they lov'd their goods more or less, by so much
sooner or later they shall be sav'd.</hi> And what he said of
this kind of sin, <hi>viz.</hi> too much worldliness, with the
same reason he might suppose of others; this he
thought possible, but of this he was not sure, and
therefore it was not then an article of faith, and
though now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made it so, yet
it appears that it was not so from the beginning, but
is part of their new fashion'd faith. And <hi>E. W.</hi> striving
so impossibly, and so weakly to avoid the pressure of
this argument, should do well to consider, whether
he have not more strained his Conscience, than the
words of S. <hi>Austin.</hi> But this matter must not pass
thus. S. <hi>Austin</hi> repeats this whole passage <hi>verbatim</hi> in
his answer to the 8. <hi>Quest. of Dulcitius, Qu. 1.</hi> and still
answers in this and other appendant Questions of the
same nature, <hi>viz.</hi> whether prayers for the dead be
available, <hi>&amp;c. Quest. 2.</hi> and whether upon the instant


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64671:206"/>
of Christs appearing,<note place="margin">De octo Quest. Dulcit. Qu. 3.</note> he will pass to judgment, <hi>Qu. 3.
In these things which we have describ'd, our and the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of others may be so exercis'd and instructed, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
that they pass not for Canonical authority.</hi> And in
the answer to the first Question he speaks in the style
of a doubtful person <q>[whether men suffer such things
in this life only, or also such certain judgments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
even after this life, this Understanding of this
sentence, is not as I suppose abhorrent from truth.]</q>
The same words he also repeats in his book <hi>de fide &amp;
operibus, Chap. 16.</hi> There is yet another place of
S. <hi>Austin,</hi> in which it is plain he still is a doubting
person in the Question of Purgatory. His sense is
this;<note place="margin">S. Aug. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei. lib. 21 cap. 26.</note> 
                     <q>After the death of the body until the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
if in the interval the spirits of the dead are
said to suffer that kind of fire, which they feel not,
who had not such manners and loves in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
that their wood, hay and stubble ought to be
consum'd; but others feel who brought such build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
along with them, whether there only, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
here and there, or whether therefore here that it
might not be there, that they feel a fire of a transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tribulation burning their secular buildings,
(though escaping from damnation) I reprove it not;
for peradventure it is true.]</q> So S. <hi>Austin,</hi> perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
yea, is always, peradventure nay; and will
the <hi>Bigots</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be content with such a
confession of faith as this of S. <hi>Austin</hi> in the present ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle?
I believe not.</p>
                  <p>But now after all this, I will not deny but S. <hi>Austin</hi>
was much inclin'd to believe Purgatory fire, and
therefore I shall not trouble my self to answer the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to that purpose, which <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and from him
these transcribers bring out of this Father, though
most of them are drawn out of Apocryphal, spurious
and suspected pieces, as his Homilies <hi>de S. S. &amp;c.</hi> yet


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64671:206"/>
that which I urge is this, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> did not esteem
this to be a doctrine of the Church, no article of faith,
but a disputable opinion; and yet though he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to the wrong part of the opinion, yet it is very
certain that he sometimes speaks expresly against this
doctrine, and other times speaks things absolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the opinion of Purgatory, which is
more than an argument of his confessed doubting; for
it is a declaration that he understood nothing certain
in this affair, but that the contrary to his opinion was
the more probable. And this appears in these few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words.<note place="margin">De C. Dei. lib. 21. c. 13.</note> S. <hi>Austin</hi> hath these words; <hi>some suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
temporary punishments in this life only, others after
death, others both now and then: Bellarmine,</hi> and from
him <hi>Diaphanta</hi> urges this as a great proof of S. <hi>Austins</hi>
doctrine. But he destroys it in the words immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
following, and makes it useless to the <hi>hypothesis</hi> of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; <hi>This shall be before they suffer the
last and severest judgment</hi> (meaning as S. <hi>Austin</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
does such sayings, of the General conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at the end of the world.) But whether he does so
or no,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> yet he adds; <hi>But all of them come not into the
everlasting punishments, which after the Judgment shall
be to them who after death suffer the temporary.]</hi> By
which doctrine of S. <hi>Austin, viz.</hi> that those who are
in his Purgatory shall many of them be damn'd; and
the temporary punishments after death, do but usher
in the Eternal after judgment; he destroys the salt of
the <hi>Roman</hi> fire, who imagines that all that go to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
shall be sav'd: Therefore this testimony of
S. <hi>Austin,</hi> as it is nothing for the avail of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Purgatory, so by the appendage it is much against it,
which <hi>Coquaeus, Torrensis,</hi> and especially Cardinal
<hi>Perron,</hi> observing, have most violently corrupted these
words, by falsely translating them. So <hi>Perron, Tous
ceux qui souffrent des peines temporelles apres la mort, ne


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64671:207"/>
viennent pas aux peines Eternelles qui auront tien apres le
judgement,</hi> which reddition is expresly against the
sense of S. <hi>Austins</hi> words.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>But another</hi> hypothesis <hi>there is in S.</hi> Austin, <hi>to
which without dubitation he does peremptorily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here,
which I before intimated,</hi> viz. <hi>that although he
admit of Purgatory pains after this life, yet none but
such as shall be at the day of Judgment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Purgatorias autem poenas nullas futuras opinetur, nisi ante illud ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumque judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Cap. 16.</note> [Whoever
therefore desires to avoid the eternal pains, let him be not
only baptiz'd, but also justified in Christ, and truly pass
from the Devil into Christ. But let him not think that
there shall be any Purgatory pains but before that last
and dreadful Judgment] <hi>meaning not only that there
shall be none to cleanse them after the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that then, at the approach of that day the
General fire shall try and purge: And so himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
his own sense;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Psal. 6.</note> All they that have not Christ in the

wood, hay, stubble.] <hi>So that in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the trial and escape shall be; for then shall the
trial and the condemnation be. But yet more clear are
his words</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">De C. D. lib. 16. c. 24. &amp; lib. 20. c. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>in other places:</hi> So, at the setting of the

which are to be sav'd by fire, and those who are to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the fire;] <hi>nothing is plainer that that S.</hi> Austin
<hi>understood that those, who are to be sav'd so as by fire,
are to be sav'd by passing through the fire at the day of
judgment; that was his opinion of Purgatory. And
again</hi> [out of these things which are spoken it seems more
evidently to appear, that there shall be certain purgatory
pains of some persons in that judgment. For what thing
else can be understood, where it is said, who shall endure
the day of his coming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64671:207"/>
3. S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks things expresly against the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Purgatory; <q>[know ye that when the soul is
pluck'd from the body presently it is plac'd in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
according to its good deservings, or else for her
sins is thrown headlong <hi>in inferni Tartara,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug. tam. 9. de vanitate saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, c. 1. &amp; de consolatione mortuorum Serm. 2. cap. 1.</note> into the
hell of the damned; for I know not well how else to
render it.] And again [the soul retiring is receiv'd
by Angels and plac'd either in the bosom of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
if she be faithful, or in the custody of the infernal
prison,<note place="margin">De D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gmat. 6. Eccles. cap. 79.</note> if it be sinful, until the appointed day comes,
in which she shall receive her body:]</q> pertinent to
which is that of S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aut Augustini aut Gennadii.</note> if he be Author of that
excellent book <hi>de Eccles. dogmatibus,</hi> which is imputed
to him. <hi>[After the ascension of our Lord to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
the souls of all the Saints are with Christ, and going
from the body go unto Christ, expecting the resurrection of
their body.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I shall insist no further upon these things; I
suppose it very apparent, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> was no way
confident of his fancy of Purgatory, and that if he had
fancied right, yet it was not the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory
that he fancied. There is only one objection which I
know of, which when I have clear'd I shall pass on to
other things. S. <hi>Austin,</hi> speaking of such who have
liv'd a middle kind of an indifferent pious life, saith,
<hi>Constat autem,</hi> &amp;c. but it is certain, that such before
the day of judgment being purg'd by temporal pains
which their spirit suffer, when they have receiv'd
their bodies, shall not be deliver'd to the punishment
of Eternal fire;] here is a positive determination of
the article, by a word of confidence, and a full certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate;
and therefore S. <hi>Austin</hi> in this article was not
a doubting person. To this I answer, it may be he was
confident here, but it lasted not long; this fire was
made of straw and soon went out; for within two
Chapters after, he expresly doubts, as I have prov'd.


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64671:208"/>
2. These words may refer to the purgatory fire at the
general conflagration of the world; and if they be so
referred, it is most agreeable to his other sentiments.
3. This <hi>Constat,</hi> or decretory phrase, and some lines
before or after it, are not in the old books of <hi>Bruges</hi>
and <hi>Colein,</hi> nor in the copies printed at <hi>Friburg;</hi> and
<hi>Ludovicus vives</hi> supposes they were a marginal note
crept since into the Text. Now this objection being
remov'd,<note place="margin">Contra Pharis. tit. 8.</note> there remains no ground to deny, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
was a doubting person in the article of Purgatory.
And this <hi>Erasmus</hi> expresly affirm'd of him;<note place="margin">In exposit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis missae. Advers. haeres. lib. 12. tit. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorium.</note> and the
same is said of him by <hi>Hofmeister,</hi> but modestly; and
against his doubting in his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> he brings only
a testimony in behalf of prayer for the dead, which is
nothing to the purpose; and this is also sufficiently
noted by <hi>Alphonsus a Castro,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Cathol. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mao pacifico 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de purgat.</note> and by <hi>Barnesius.</hi> Well!
but suppose S. <hi>Austin</hi> did doubt of Purgatory? This is
no warranty to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for she does
not doubt of it as S. <hi>Austin</hi> did, but plainly condemns
it. So one of my adversaries objects; To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that the Church of <hi>England</hi> may the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it, because S. <hi>Austin</hi> doubted of it; for if it be
no Catholic doctrine, it is but a School point, and
without prejudice to the faith may be rejected. But
2. I suppose the Church of <hi>England</hi> would not have
troubled her self with the doctrine, if it had been left
as S. <hi>Austin</hi> left it; that is, but as a meer uncertain
opinion, but when the wrong end of the opinion was
taken, and made an article of faith, and damnation
threatned to them that believed it not; she had reason
to consider it, and finding it to be chaff, wholly to
scatter it away. 3. The Church of <hi>England</hi> is not
therefore to be blamed, if in any case she see more than
S. <hi>Austin</hi> did, and proceed accordingly; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does decree against divers
things, of which S. <hi>Austin</hi> indeed did not doubt, but


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64671:208"/>
affirm'd confidently; I instance in the necessity of
communicating infants, and the matter of appeals to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Authority to be examin'd is, that of <hi>Otho
Frisnigensis,</hi> concerning which there is a heavy quarrel
against the Dissuasive, for making him to speak of a
Purgatory <hi>before,</hi> whereas he speaks of one <hi>after the
day of judgment,</hi> with a <hi>Quidam asserunt,</hi> some affirm
it, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a place of Purgatory after death;
nay but you are deceiv'd says E. W. and the rest of the
adversaries; he means that some affirm there is a place
of Purgatory after the day of judgment. Now truly
that is more than I said; but that <hi>Otho</hi> said it, is by
these men confess'd. But his words are these; <hi>[I
think it ought to be search'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esse quippe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud inferos lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum purgatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in quo sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandi vel te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebris tantum afficiantur, vel expiationis ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne decoquantur quidam asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</note> 
                     <hi>whether the judgment being
pass'd, besides the lower hell, there remain a place for
lighter punishments; for that there is (below, or) in hell
a Purgatory place, in which they that are to be sav'd are
either affected (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ficiantur,</hi> invested, punish'd) <hi>with
darkness only, or else are boiled in the fire of expiation,
some do affirm.]</hi> What is or can be more plainly said
of Purgatory; for the places of Scripture brought to
confirm this opinion are such, which relate to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
between death and the last judgment; <hi>juxta
illud Patriarchae, lugens descendum ad inferos; &amp; illud
Apostoli, ipse autem salvus erit, sic tamen quasi per ignem;</hi>
I hope the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors will not deny, but these are
meant of Purgatory before the last day: and therefore
so is the opinion for the proof of which these places are
brought. 2. By <hi>post judicium,</hi> in the title, and <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacto
judicio</hi> in the Chapter, <hi>Otho</hi> means the particular
judgment passing upon every one at their death: which
he in a few lines after calls <hi>terminatis in judicio causis
singulorum.</hi> 3. He must mean it to be before the last
great day; because that which he says, <hi>some do affirm,
quidam asserunt;</hi> is, that those which are <hi>salvandi,</hi> to


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64671:209"/>
be sav'd hereafter, are either in darkness or in a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
fire; which therefore must be meant of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val;
for after the day of judgment is pass'd, and the
books shut, and the sentence pronounc'd, none can be
sav'd that are not then acquitted, unless <hi>Origens</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the salvation of Devils and damned souls be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>introduc'd.
which the Church before <hi>Otho</hi> many ages
had exploded, and therefore so good and great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would not have thought that fit to be then dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and it was not then a Question, nor a thing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
in the Church. 4. Whether <hi>Otho</hi> means
it of a Purgatory before or after the day of the last
judgment, it makes very much against the present <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
doctrine; for <hi>Otho</hi> applies the Question to the
case of infants dying without Baptism; now if their
Purgatory be before the day of judgment, then I quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Otho</hi> according to my own sense and his; but if he
means it to be after the day of judgment, then the <hi>lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
infantum</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is vanish'd. (for the
scruple was mov'd about infants) <hi>Quid de parvulis qui
solo Originali delicto tenentur fiet?</hi> and there is none
such till after dooms day; so that let it be as it will,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a loser, and therefore let them
take their choice on which side they will fall.</p>
                  <p>But now after S. <hi>Austins</hi> time; especially in the
time of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and since, there were many strange
stories told of souls appearing after death, and telling
strange things of their torments below; many of
which being gather'd together by the <hi>speculum exemplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
the legend of <hi>Lombardy</hi> and others, some of them
were noted by the Dissuasive to this purpose to shew,
that in the time when these stories were told, the fire
of Purgatory did not burn clear; but they found Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
in baths, in Eves of houses, in frosts and cold
rains, upon spits rosting like Pigs or Geese, upon
pieces of Ice. Now to this there is nothing said; but


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64671:209"/>
that in the place quoted in the <hi>speculum</hi> there is no
such thing: which saying as it was spoken invidiously,
so it was to no purpose; for if the objector ever hath
read the distinction which is quoted, throughout; he
should have found the whole story at large. It is the

though learned men deny the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues

I am willing to admit them for his,

those Dialogues have in them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
foolish, ridiculous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
stories, but yet they and
their like are made a great ground
of Purgatory; but then the right
also may be done to S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> his
doctrine of Purgatory cannot
consist with the present article of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
so fond they are in the alledging of authorities; that
they destroy their own hypothesis by their undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

not dispute; but if I were studying to do honour to
his memory, I should never admit them to be his, and
so much the rather because the doctrine of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
contradicts the Doctrine of his Commentaries,

not of any remaining punishment due to greater
sins forgiven by the bloud of Christ. But concerning
S. <hi>Gregory</hi> I shall say no more, but refer the Reader to
the Apology of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who affirm that S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
admitted a kind of Purgatory, but whether allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
or no, or thinking so really, they know not;
but what he said was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and by way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
and as it were constrained to it, by the
arguments of those who would have all sins expiable
after death, against whom he could not so likely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64671:210"/>
if he had said that none was; and therefore he
thought himself forc'd to go a middle way, and admit
a Purgatory only for little or venial sins, which yet
will do no advantage to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> or whoever is the Author of
these Dialogues hath nothing definite, or determin'd,
concerning the time, manner, measure or place; so
wholly new was this doctrine then, that it had not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
any shape or feature.</p>
                  <p>Next I am to account concerning the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom
I affirm always to have differed from the <hi>Latins,</hi> since
they had forg'd this new doctrine of Purgatory in the
<hi>Roman</hi> laboratories:<note place="margin">The letter <hi>pag. 14.</hi>
                     </note> and to prove something of this,
I affirm'd that in the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> they publish'd
an Apology directly disapproving the doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.]
Against this, up starts a man fierce and angry,
and says there was no such Apology publish'd in the
Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> for he had examined it all over, and
can find no such Apology. I am sorry for the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
loss of his labour, but if he had taken me along
with him, I could have help'd the learned man. This
Apology was written by <hi>Marcus</hi> Metropolitan of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
as <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> confesses,<note place="margin">Biblioth. lib. 6.</note> and that he offered it to
the Council of <hi>Basil.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Annot. 259.</note> That it was given and read to
the deputies of the Council,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. p. 186.</note> 
                     <hi>June 14. 1438.</hi> is attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Cusanus,</hi> and <hi>Martinus Crusius</hi> in his <hi>Turco-Graecia.</hi>
But it is no wonder if this over-learned au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the letter miss'd this Apology in his search of
the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> for this is not the only material
thing that is missing in the editions of the Council of
<hi>Basil;</hi> for <hi>Linwood</hi> that great and excellent English
Canonist made an appeal in that Council, and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
it with effect in behalf of King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Cum in temporalibus non recognoscat superiorem in
terris,</hi> &amp;c. But nothing of this now appears, though it
was then registred, but it is no new thing to forge or


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64671:211"/>
to suppress acts of Councils: But besides this, I did
not suppose he would have been so indiscreet as to have
look'd for that Apology in the editions of the Council
of <hi>Basil,</hi> but it was deliver'd to the Council by the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Council was wise enough not to keep
that upon public record; however if the Gentleman
please to see it, he may have it among the Booksellers,
if he will please to ask for the <hi>Apologia Graecorum de
igne purgatorio</hi> published by <hi>Salmasius;</hi> it was supposed
to be made by <hi>Marc</hi> Archbishop,<note place="margin">P. 93.</note> but for saving the
Gentlemans charge or trouble, I shall tell him a few

&amp;c. <hi>For these reasons the doctrine
of a Purgatory fire is to be cast out of the Church, as that
which slackens the endeavours of the diligent, as perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church never doubted of Purgatory:
whereas he hath not brought one single, true and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
testimony out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
doctrine of Purgatory, but is forc'd to bring in
that crude allegation of their words <hi>for prayer for the
dead,</hi> which is to no purpose, as all wise men know;
Indeed he quotes the <hi>Alchoran<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> for Purgatory,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. c. 11. Sect. de Mahumetanis.</note> an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic
author (it seems) to serve such an end. But
besides this, two memorable persons of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, <hi>Nilus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> and <hi>Marc</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> have in behalf of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church written against the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine in this
particular. And it is remarkable that the <hi>Latines</hi> were
and are so put to it to prove Purgatory fire from the
<hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, that they have forg'd a citation from


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64671:211"/>
                     <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In 1 Cor. 3.</note> which is not in him at all, but was first
cited in <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> either out of his own

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. de purgat. c. 5. Sect. ex Graecis</note>, which to wise men cannot but be a very

saw it, but yet was resolv'd to run through it and
out-face it; but <hi>Nilus</hi> taking notice of it, says that
there are no such words in <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the many copies
of his works which they had. In <hi>Greek</hi> it is certain
they are not, and <hi>Gagneius</hi> first translated them into

                     </gap>, as gold in the fornace
(meaning it of the affliction of the righteous in this
world) but unluckily he made use of that Chapter:
In the first verse of which chapter, it is said, <hi>The souls
of the righteous are in the hands of God, and no torment
shall touch them,</hi> which is a testimony more pregnant
against the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory, than all that they can
bring from the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers for it. And this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
confutes the Dissuasive, as he thinks, by telling
the story according as his own Church hath set it
down, who as with subtle and potent arts they forc'd
the <hi>Greeks</hi> to a seeming Union, so they would be sure
not to tell the world in their own records how unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
they carried themselves. But besides this, the
very answer which the Archbishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> gave to
the <hi>Latines</hi> in that Council (and which words the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
here sets down and confesses) are a plain confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himself, for the <hi>Latines</hi> standing for a Purgatory
fire, temporary; the Archbishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> denies it,
saying, <hi>That the Italians, confess a fire, both in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world and purgatory by it</hi> (that is, before the day of
Judgment) <hi>and in the world to come, but not Purgatory
but Eternal; But the Greeks hold a fire in the world to


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64671:212"/>
come only,</hi> (meaning Eternal) <hi>and a temporary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of souls, that is, that they go into a dark place, and
of grief, but that they are purged,</hi> that is, delivered from
the dark place, <hi>by Priests prayers and sacrifices, and by
alms, but not by fire.]</hi> Then they fell on disputing about
Purgatory fire, to which the <hi>Greeks</hi> delay'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
And afterwards being pressed to answer, they
refus'd to say any thing about Purgatory, and when
they at the upshot of all were <hi>utcunque</hi> United, <hi>Joseph</hi>
the Patriarch of <hi>C. P.</hi> made a most pitiful confession
of Purgatory in such general and crafty terms, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
shew'd, that as the <hi>Greeks</hi> were forc'd to
do something, so the <hi>Latins</hi> were content with any
thing, for by those terms, the Question between them
was no way determin'd, <hi>Romae veteris Papam Domini

there is a Purgatory. No, for the <hi>Greeks</hi> confess'd it,

this world, and after this world by the prayers of the
Priests, and the alms of their friends, the purgation
was made, <hi>not by fire,</hi> as I cited the words before. The
<hi>Latins</hi> told them there should be no Union without
it; The <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor refus'd, and all this the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
is pleas'd to acknowledge; but after a very great

hope to get assistance of the <hi>Latins:</hi> But in this also
they were cosen'd, and having lost <hi>C. P.</hi> many of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> attributed that fatal loss to their dissembling
Union made at <hi>Florence;</hi> and on the other side the
<hi>Latins</hi> imputed it to their opinion of the procession of
the Holy Ghost: however, the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches never
admitted that union as is averred by <hi>Laonicus Chalcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylas,

is a strange thing that this affair, of which all <hi>Europe</hi>

To this the letter<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> answers; It is not said

it may as well one as the other, Christians as

as the other. E. W<note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note>. answers, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> means

it is vain to say that this Council was only given

a Christian, he would or at least might have us'd the
same argument, not to put any part of his duty off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
confidence of any thing to be done or suffered after
this life. For his argument is this, this is the time of
repentance, after death it is not; now you may satisfie
(that is, appease) the Divine anger, after this life
is ended, nothing of this can be done. For

the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, he could not
in better words have impugned it, than here he does.
All that have sinn'd must here look to it, here they
must confess, here beg pardon, here make amends and
satisfie, afterwards neither one nor the other shall be
admitted. Now if to Christians also there is granted
no leave to repent, no means to satisfie, no means of
pardon after this life, these words are so various and
comprehensive that they include all cases; and it is
plain S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks it indefinitely, there is no place
of repentance, no place of satisfaction; none at all,
neither to Heathens nor to Christians. But now let
these words be set against the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
that there is a place called Purgatory, in which the
souls tormented do satisfie, and <hi>come not out thence till
they have paid, (viz.</hi> by sufferings, or by suffrages)
<hi>the utmost farthing,</hi> and then see which we will follow:
for they differ in all the points of the Compass. And
these men do nothing but betray the weakness of their
cause by expounding S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ense of new
distinctions, made but yesterday in the forges of the
Schools. And indeed the whole affair upon which the
answer of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relies, which these men have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
to their own use, is unreasonable. For is it a


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64671:214"/>
likely business, that when men have committed great
crimes they shall be pardon'd here by confession, and
the ministeries of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet that the
venial sins though confess'd in the general, and as well
as they can be, and the party absolved, yet there
should be prepared for their expiation the intolerable
torments of hell fire for a very long time; and that for
the greater sins, for which men have <hi>agreed with their
adversary in the way,</hi> and the Adversary hath forgiven
them, yet that for these also they should be cast into
prison, from whence they shall not come till the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
farthing be paid; that's against the design of our
Blessed Saviours Counsel, for if that be the case, then
though we and our adversaries are agreed upon the
main, and the debt forgiven, yet nevertheless we may
be deliver'd to the tormentors. But then concerning
the sense of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in this particular, no man can
doubt that shall have but read his excellent treatise of
mortality: that he could not, did not admit of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
after death before the day of judgment, for he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
said it in that excellent treatise which he made to
comfort and strengthen Christians against the fear of
death; that immediately after death we go to God or
the Devil: <q>and therefore it is for him only to fear to
die, who is not willing to go to Christ, and he only
is to be unwilling to go to Christ who believes not
that he begins to reign with Christ.] That we in the
mean time die, we pass over by death to immortality.
It is not a going forth, but a pass over, and when our
temporal course is run, a going over to immortality.

snares of the world to Paradise, and the Heavenly
kingdom.]</q> There are here many other things so

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64671:214"/>
should read that treatise, and not be cur'd of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</p>
                  <p>To the same purpose is that of S. <hi>Dionys,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Dionys.</note> calling
death the end of holy agonies;] and therefore it is to
be suppos'd they have no more agonies to run through
immediately after death. To this E. W. answers;
that S. <hi>Denis</hi> means,<note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>that death is the end of all the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of this life.</hi> A goodly note! and never revealed
till then and now; as if this were a good argument to
incourage men to contend bravely, and not to fear
death, because when they are once dead, they shall no
more be troubled with the troubles of this life; indeed
you may go to worse, and death may let you into a
state of being as bad as hell, and of greater torments
than all the pains of this world put together amount
to.] But to let alone such ridiculous subterfuges,
see the words of S. <hi>Dionys,</hi> 
                     <q>[They that live a holy
life, looking to the true promises of God, as if they
were to behold the truth it self in that resurrection
which is according to it, with firm and true hope,
and in a Divine joy come to the sleep of death, as to
an end of all holy contentions;]</q> now certainly if
the doctrine of Purgatory were true, and that they
who had contended here, and for all their troubles in
this world were yet in a tolerable condition, should
be told, that now they shall go to worse, he that
should tell them so would be but one of <hi>Jobs</hi> comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
No, the servant of God <hi>[coming to the end of his

and therefore 1. whereas <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> says, after our

that <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> means here to speak of the
two final states after the day of judgment, for so it
seems he understands <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>presently after death,</hi> to
mean the <hi>day of judgment;</hi> of the time of which neither
men nor Angels know any thing. And whereas <hi>Justin
Martyr</hi> says, that presently the souls of the righteous
go to Paradise,<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> E. W. answers: 2. That <hi>Justin</hi> does
not say that all just souls are carried presently into
Heaven; no, <hi>Justin</hi> says, <hi>into Paradise,</hi> true, but let
it be remembred that it is so a part of Heaven, as <hi>lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
infantum</hi> is by themselves call'd a part of hell; that
is, a <hi>place of bliss;</hi> the region of the blessed. But 3.
<hi>Justin</hi> says that presently there is a separation made,
but he says not that the souls of the righteous are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Paradise.] That's the next answer, which
the very words of <hi>Justin</hi> do contradict. <hi>There is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
a separation made of the just and unjust, for they are
by the Angels carried to the places they have deserved.</hi>
This is the separation which is made, one is carried to
Paradise, the other to a place in hell. But these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such pitiful offers at answering, the Gentleman
tries another way, and says, 4. That this affirmative
of <hi>Justin</hi> contradicts another saying of <hi>Justin,</hi> which I
cited out of <hi>Sixtus Senensis,</hi> that <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other of the Fathers, affirm'd that the souls of men
are kept in secret receptacles, <hi>reserved unto the sentence
of the great day;</hi> and that before then no man <hi>receives


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64671:215"/>
according to his works done in this life.</hi> To this I answer,
that one opinion does not contradict another; for
though the Fathers believ'd that <hi>they who die in the
Lord rest from their labours,</hi> and are in blessed places,
and have antepasts of joy and comforts, yet in those
places they are reserv'd unto the judgment of the great
day: The intermedial joy or sorrow respectively of the
just and unjust does but antidate the final sentence;
and as the comforts of Gods spirit in this life are indeed
graces of God and rewards of piety, as the torments
of an evil conscience are the wages of impiety, yet as
these do not hinder, but that the great reward is given
at dooms-day and not before, so neither do the joys
which the righteous have in the interval. They can
both consist together, and are generally affirm'd by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers.<note place="margin">E. W. pag. 36.</note> And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
this Gentleman might have learn'd from <hi>Sixtus
Senensis</hi> how to have reconcil'd these two opinions; for
he quotes him, saying there is a double beatitude, the
one imperfect of soul only, the other consummate
and perfect of soul and body. The first the Fathers
call'd by several names of <hi>Sinus Abrahae, Atrium Dei,
sub Altare,</hi> &amp;c. The other, <hi>perfect joy, the glory of the
resurrection,</hi> &amp;c. But it matters not what is said, or
how it be contradicted, so it seem but to serve a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
turn. But at last, if nothing of this will do,
these words are not the words of <hi>Iustin,</hi> for he is not the
Author of the Questions and Answers <hi>ad orthodoxos.</hi>
To which I answer, it matters not whether they be
<hi>Iustins</hi> or no: But they are put together in the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his works, and they are generally called his,
and cited under his name, and made use of by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. c. 25. &amp; 26. lib. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 5 l. 3. de Euchar. c. 6.</note>, when he supposes them to be to his purpose.
However the Author is Ancient and Orthodox, and so
esteem'd in the Church, and in this particular speaks
according to the doctrine of the more Ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64671:216"/>
well! but how is this against Purgatory? says
E. W.<note place="margin">P. 36. line 29.</note> for they may be in secret receptacles after they
have been in Purgatory. To this I answer, that he
dares not teach that for doctrine in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who believes that the souls deliver'd out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
go immediately to <hi>the heaven of the Blessed,</hi> and
therefore if his book had been worth the perusing by
the Censors of books, he might have been question'd,
and followed Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> fortune. And he adds, <hi>it
might be afterwards according to</hi> Origens <hi>opinion;</hi> that
is, Purgatory might be after the day of judgment, for
so <hi>Origen</hi> held, that all the fires are Purgatory, and
the Devils themselves should be sav'd. Thus this poor
Gentleman thinking it necessary to answer one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against Purgatory brought in the dissuasive,
cares not to answer by a condemned heresie, rather
than reason shall be taught by any son of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> But however, the very words of the Fathers
cross his slippery answers so, that they thrust him into
a corner; for in these receptacles the godly have joy,
and they enter into them as soon as they die, and abide
there till the day of judgment.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is so full,<note place="margin">De bono mortis cap. 4.</note> pertinent and material to the
Question in hand, and so destructive of the <hi>Roman hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi>
that nothing can be said against it. His
words are these, <q>[therefore in all regards death is
good because it divides those that were always fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they may not impugne each other, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a certain port to them, who being toss'd in
the sea of this world require the station of faithful
rest; and because it makes not our state worse, but
such as it finds every one, such it reserves him to the
future judgment, and nourishes him with rest, and
withdraws him from the envy of present things, and
composes him with the expectation of future things.]</q>
E. W.<note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> thinking himself bound to say something to


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64671:216"/>
these words; answers, <hi>It is an excellent saying, for
worse he is not, but infinitely better, that quit off the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of living here, is ascertain'd of future bliss hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is the whole drift of the Saint in that Chapter:
Read it, and say afterwards if I say not true.]</hi> It is well
put off. But there are very many that read him, who
never will or can examine what S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> says, and
withal such he hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to escape. But as to the thing:
That death gives a man advantage, and by its own
fault no disadvantage is indeed not only the whole drift
of that Chapter, but of that whole book. But not for
that reason only is a man the better for death, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it makes him not worse in order to Eternity;
nay, it does not alter him at all as to that, for as death
finds him, so shall the judgment find him (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not purified by Purgatory) for such he is reserved;
and not only thus, but <hi>it cherishes him with rest,</hi> which
would be very ill done if death carried him to Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Now all these last words and many others, E. W.
is pleas'd to take no notice of, as not being for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But he that pleases to see more, may read the
12. and 18. Chapters of the same Treatise.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s saying,<note place="margin">S. Greg. Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anz. orat. 15. in plagam gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

purgation, can no way be put off by any pretences.
For he means it of the time after death before the day
of judgment, which is directly oppos'd to the doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and unless you will suppose
that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> believ'd two Purgatories, it is certain
he did not believe the <hi>Roman;</hi> for he taught that the
purgation which he calls <hi>Baptism by fire,</hi> and <hi>the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
yet so as by fire,</hi> was to be perform'd at the day of
judgment: and the curiosity of that trial is the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that fire, as <hi>Nicetas</hi> expounds S. <hi>Gregories</hi>
words in his oration <hi>in sancta lumina.</hi> So that S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
affirming that this world is the place of purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that after this world there is no purgation,


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64671:217"/>
could not have spoken any thing more direct against
the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Hilary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Psalm.</note> and S. <hi>Macarius</hi> speak of two states after
death, and no more. True says <hi>E. W. but they are the
two final states.</hi> That is true too, in some sense, for
it is either of eternal good, or evil; but to one of these
states they are consigned and determined at the time
of their death, at which time every one is sent either
to the bosom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to a place of pain,
where they are reserved to the sentence of the great
day. S. <hi>Hillary</hi>'s words are these <hi>[There is no stay or
delaying. For the day of judgement is either an eternal
retribution of beatitude or of pain: But the time of our
death hath every one in his laws whiles either</hi> Abraham
<hi>(viz.</hi> the bosom of <hi>Abraham) or pain reserves every one
unto the Judgment.]</hi> These words need no Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
He that can reconcile these to the <hi>Roman</hi> Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,<note place="margin">Homil. 22. vide etiam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 26.</note>
will be a most mighty man in controversie. And
so also are the words of S. <hi>Macarius, when they go out
of the body, the quires of Angels receive their souls, and
carry them to their proper place</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>to a
pure world, and so lead them to the Lord.]</hi> Such words
as these are often repeated by the Holy Fathers, and
Doctors of the Ancient Church; I sum them up with
the saying of S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Virgin:</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not death that happens to the righteous,
but a translation: For they are translated out of this
world into everlasting rest. And as a man would go
out of prison, so do the Saints go out of this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
life, unto those good things which are prepared
for them.] Now let these and all the precedent words
be confronted against the sad complaints made for the
souls in Purgatory by <hi>Joh. Gerson,</hi> in his <hi>querela de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorum,</hi>
and Sr. <hi>Tho. More</hi> in his supplication of
souls, and it will be found that the doctrine of the
Fathers differs from the doctrine of the Church of


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64671:217"/>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> as much as heaven and hell, rest and labor, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
torments and great joy. I conclude this matter of
quotations by the saying of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Letter</hi> p. 18.</note> which one of
<hi>my adversaries</hi> could not find, because the printer was
mistaken; It is the 91. Epistle, so known, and so us'd
by the <hi>Roman</hi> writers in the Qu. of Confession,
that if he be a man of learning it cannot be suppos'd,
but he knew where to find them. The words are these
<q>But if any of them, for whom we pray unto the
Lord being intercepted by any obstacle, falls from
the benefit of the present Indulgences, and before he
comes to the constituted remedies shall end his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
life by humane condition (or frailty) that which
abiding in the body he hath not received, being out
of the flesh he cannot.</q> Now against these words of
S. <hi>Leo,</hi> set the present doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
[that what is not finished of penances here, a man may
pay in Purgatory] and let the world judge whether
S. <hi>Leo</hi> was in this point a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic. Indeed
S. <hi>Leo</hi> forgot to make use of the late distinction of sins
<hi>venial</hi> and <hi>mortal,</hi> of the punishment of mortal sins
remaining after the fault is taken away; but I hope the
<hi>Roman</hi> Doctors will excuse the Saint, because the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
is but new and modern. But this Testimony
of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> must not go for a single Testimony:
<hi>That, which abiding in the body could not be receiv'd, out
of the body cannot;</hi> that is, when the soul is gone out of
the body, as death finds them, so shall the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
find them. And this was the sense of the whole
Church; for after death there is no change of state
before the General Trial: no passing from <hi>pain</hi> to <hi>rest</hi>
in the state of separation, and therefore either there
are no Purgatory pains, or if there be, there is no ease
of them before the day of judgment; and the Prayers
and Masses of the Church cannot give remedy to one
poor soul; and this must of necessity be confessed by


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64671:218"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, or else they must shew that ever
any one Catholic Father did teach, that after death, and
before the day of Judgment, any souls are translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a state of bliss out of a state of pain: that is, that
from Purgatory they go to heaven before the day of
Judgment. He that can shew this, will teach me what
I have not yet learned, but he that cannot shew it, must
not pretend that the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine of Purgatory
was ever known to the Ancient Fathers of the
Church.</p>

                  <head>SECTION III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of Transubstantiation.</head>
                  <p>THE purpose of the Dissuasive was to prove the
doctrine of Transubstantiation to be new, neither
Catholic nor Apostolic. In order to which I thought
nothing more likely to perswade or dissuade, than the
testimonies of the parties against themselves. And
although I have many other inducements (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the sequel;) yet by so earnestly contending to
invalidate the truth of the quotations, the Adversaries
do confess by implication, if these sayings be as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
then I have evinc'd my main point, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrines, as differing from us, are novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and no parts of the Catholic faith.</p>
                  <p>Thus therefore the Author of the letter begins. <hi>He
quotes Scotus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>as declaring the doctrine of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is not expressed in the Canon of the Bible; which he
saith not. To the same purpose he quotes</hi> Ocham, <hi>but I
can finde no such thing in him. To the same purpose he
quotes</hi> Roffensis <hi>but he hath no such thing.]</hi> But in order


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64671:218"/>
to the verification of what I said, I desire it be first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
what I did say, for I did not deliver it so crudely
as this Gentleman sets it down: For 1. These words
<hi>[the doctrine of Transubstantiation is not expressed in the
Canon of the Bible]</hi> are not the words of all them before
nam'd, they are the sense of them all, but the words
but of one or two of them. 2. When I say that some
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers say that Transubstantiation is
not express'd in the Scripture, I mean, and so I said
plainly, <hi>[as without the Churches declaration to compel
us to admit of it.]</hi> Now then for the quotations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
I hope I shall give a fair account. 1. The
words quoted,<note place="margin">Lect. 40. in Can. Missae.</note> are the words of <hi>Biel,</hi> when he had first
affirmed that Christs body is contained truly under
the bread, and that it is taken by the faithful (all which
we believe and teach in the Church of <hi>England)</hi> he
adds; <hi>Tamen quomodo ibi sit Christi corpus, an per con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versionem
alicujus in ipsum</hi> (that is, the way of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation)
<hi>an sine conversione incipiat esse Corpus Christi
cum pane, manentibus substantia &amp; accidentibus panis non
invenitur expressum in Canone Biblii:</hi> and that's the way
of Consubstantiation; so that here is expressely taught
what I affirm'd was taught, that the Scriptures did not
express the doctrine of Transubstantiation; and he
adds, that concerning this, there were Anciently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
opinions. Thus far the quotation is right: But
of this man there is no notice taken. But what of
<hi>Scotus? He saith no such thing;</hi> well suppose that, yet
I hope this Gentleman will excuse me for <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
sake, who says the same thing of <hi>Scotus</hi> as I do, and he
might have found it in the Margent against the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Scotus</hi> if he had pleas'd.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. c. 23.</note> His words are these
<hi>[Secondly he saith</hi> (viz.<note place="margin">Sect. Secundò dicit.</note> 
                     <hi>Scotus) that there is not extant
any place of Scripture so express, without the declaration
of the Church, that it can compel us to admit of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation:


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64671:219"/>
And this is not altogether improbable: For
though the Scriptures which we brought above seem so clear
to us, that it may compel a man that is not wilful, yet
whether it be so or no, it may worthily be doubted, since
most learned and acute men (such as</hi> Scotus <hi>eminently
was) believe the contrary.]</hi> Well! But the Gentleman
can find no such thing in <hi>Ocham:</hi> I hope he did not
look far, for <hi>OCham</hi> is not the man I mean; however
the printer might have mistaken, but it is easily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,
because from <hi>O. Cam.</hi> meaning <hi>Odo Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis,</hi>
it was easie for the printer or transcriber to
write <hi>Ocam,</hi> as being of more public name; But the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Cambray</hi> is the man, that followed <hi>Scotus</hi> in
this opinion,<note place="margin">Vbi suprae.</note> and is acknowledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to
have said the same that <hi>Scotus</hi> did, he being one of his
<hi>docti &amp; acutissimi viri</hi> there mentioned.<note place="margin">Contra. Captiv.</note> Now if <hi>Rof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensis</hi>
have the same thing too,<note place="margin">Babyl. c. 1.</note> this Author of the letter
will have cause enough to be a little ashamed: And for
this, I shall bring his words, speaking of the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Blessed Sacrament by our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
he says, <hi>[Neque ullum hic verbum positum est quo
probetur in nostra Missa veram fieri carnis &amp; sanguinis
Christi praesentiam.</hi> I suppose I need to say no more to

a famous or rather infamous quotation out of <hi>Peter
Lombard,</hi> and adds foul and uncivil words, which I pass
by: but the thing is this; that I said, <hi>Petrus Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
could not tell whether there was a substantial change or
no.</hi> I did say so, and I brought the very words of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>
to prove it, and these very words <hi>E. W.</hi> himself
acknowledges. <hi>Si autem quaeritur qualis fit ista conversio,
an formalis an substantialis, vel alterius generis, definire
non sufficio: [I am not able to define or determine whether
that change be formal or substantial:]</hi> So far <hi>E. W.</hi> quotes
him, but leaves out one thing very material, <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
besides <hi>formal, or substantial,</hi> it be <hi>of another kinde.</hi>
Now <hi>E. W.</hi> not being able to deny that <hi>Lombard</hi> said
this, takes a great deal of useless pains, not one word
of all that he says being to the purpose, or able to
make it probable that <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> did not say so, or
that he did not think so. But the thing is this: <hi>Biel</hi>
reckon'd three opinions which in <hi>Lombards</hi> time were
in the Church; the first of Consubstantiation which
was the way which long since then, <hi>Luther</hi> followed.
The second that the substance of bread is made the
flesh of Christ, but ceases not to be what it was. But
this is not the doctrine of Transubstantiation for that
makes a third opinion, which is that the substance of
bread ceases to be, and nothing remains but the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<hi>Quartam opinionem addit Magister,</hi> that is,
<hi>Peter Lombard</hi> adds a fourth opinion; that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64671:220"/>
of bread is not converted, but is annihilated:
this is made by <hi>Scotus</hi> to be the second opinion] Now
of these four opinions, all which were then permitted
and disputed;<note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> 
                     <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> seems to follow the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
but if this was his opinion it was no more, for
he could not determine whether that were the truth or
no. But whether he does or no truly, I think it is
very hard for any man to tell; for this question was
but in the forge, not polished, not made bright with
long handling. And this was all that I affirm'd out of
the Master of Sentences, I told of no opinion of his
at all, but that in his time they did not know whether
it <hi>(viz.</hi> the doctrine of Transubstantiation) were true
or no, that is, the generality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics
did not know: and he himself could not define it. And
this appears unanswerably by <hi>Peter Lombards</hi> bringing
their several sentiments in this article: and they that
differ in their judgements about an article, and yet
esteem the others Catholic, may think what they
please, but they <hi>cannot tell certainly what is truth.</hi> But
then as for <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> himself, all that I said of
him was this, that he could not tell, he <hi>could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi>
whether there was any substantial change or
no. If in his after discourse he declares that the
change is of substances, he told it for no other than as
a meer opinion: if he did, let him answer for that,
not I; for that he could not determine it, himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
said it, in the beginning of the eleventh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
And therefore these Gentlemen would
better have consulted with truth and modesty, if they
had let this alone, and not have made such an outcry
against a manifest truth. Now let me observe one
thing which will be of great use in this whole affair, and
demonstrate the change of this doctrine. These three
opinions were all held by Catholics,<note place="margin">Innocent. de of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. Mis. part. 3. cap. 18.</note> and the opinions
are recorded not only by Pope <hi>Innocentius 3.</hi> but in the


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64671:220"/>
gloss of the Canon Law it self.<note place="margin">Cap. cum Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha in gloss. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>trav. de ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebr. miss.</note> For this opinion was
not fix'd and setled, nor as yet well understood, but
still disputed (as we see in <hi>Lombard</hi> and <hi>Scotus:)</hi> And
although they all agreed in this (as <hi>Salmeron</hi> observes
of these three opinions, as he cites them out of <hi>Scotus)
that the true body of Christ is there, because to deny this
were against the faith;</hi> and therefore this was then
enough to cause them to be esteemed Catholics, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they denied nothing which was then against the
faith, but all agreed in that, yet now the case is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for whereas one of the opinions was, that the
substance of bread remains, and another opinion, that
the substance of bread is annihilated, but is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into the body of Christ; now both of these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are made heresie, and the contrary to them,
which is the third opinion pass'd into an article of
faith.<note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> 
                     <hi>Quod vero ibi substantia panis non remanet, jam
etiam ut articulus fidei definitum est, &amp; conversionis sive
transubstantiationis nomen evictum.</hi> So <hi>Salmeron.</hi> Now
in <hi>Peter Lombards</hi> time; if they who believed Christs
real presence were good Catholics, though they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no Transubstantiation or Consubstantiation, that
is, did not descend into consideration of the
manner, why may they not be so now? Is there any
new revelation now of the manner? Or why, is the
way to Heaven now made narrower than in <hi>Lombards</hi>
time? For the Church of <hi>England</hi> believes according
to one of these opinions; and therefore is as good a
Catholic Church as <hi>Rome</hi> was then, which had not
determined the manner. Nay if we use to value an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
the more, by how much the more Ancient it is,
certainly it is more honourable that we should reform
to the Ancient model, rather than conform to the new.
However, this is also plainly consequent to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of <hi>Salmeron; The abettors of those three opinions,
some of them do deny something that is of faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64671:221"/>
the faith of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>now is not the
same it was in the days of</hi> Peter Lombard.
Lastly, this also is to be remark'd, that to prove any
ancient Author to hold the doctrine of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
as it is at this day an article of faith at <hi>Rome,</hi> it
is not enough to say, that <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> or <hi>Durand,</hi>
or <hi>Scotus,</hi> &amp;c. did say that where bread was before,
there is Christs body now; for they may say that and
more, and yet not come home to the present article;
and therefore E. W. does argue weakly, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<hi>Lombard</hi> to say one thing, <hi>[viz.</hi> that he could
not define whether there was a substantial change or
no, (which indeed he spake plainly) because he brings
him saying something as if he were resolv'd the change
were substantial, which yet he speaks but obscurely.
And the truth is, this question of Transubstantiation
is so intricate and involved amongst them, seems so
contrary to sense and reason, and does so much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to all the powers of the soul, that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if at first the Doctors could not make any thing
distinctly of it. However, whatever they did make of
it, certain it is they more agreed with the present
Church of <hi>England,</hi> than with the present Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> for we say as they said, Christs body is truly
there, and there is a conversion of the Elements into
Christs body, for what before the Consecration in all
senses was <hi>bread,</hi> is after Consecration in some sense,
<hi>Christs body;</hi> but they did not all of them say, that the
substance of bread was destroyed, and some of them
denied the conversion of the bread into the flesh of
Christ; which whosoever shall now do, will be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick.<note place="margin">E. W. pag. 37.</note> And therefore it is a vain
procedure to think they have prov'd their doctrine of
Transubstantiation out of the Fathers also; if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
tell us, <q>[That bread is chang'd out of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into the body of Christ: that by holy invocation


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64671:221"/>
it is no more common bread: that as water in <hi>Cana</hi>
of <hi>Galilee</hi> was chang'd into wine; so in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,
wine is changed into bloud: That bread is only
bread before the sacramental words, but after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
is made the body of Christ.]</q> For though I
very much doubt, all these things in equal and full
measures cannot be prov'd out of the Fathers, yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they were, yet all this comes not up to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Article of Transubstantiation: All those words
are true in a very good sense, and they are in that sense
believ'd in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but that the bread
is no more bread in the natural sense, and that it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
nothing, but the natural body of Christ, that
the substance of one is passed into the substance of the
other, this is not affirmed by the Fathers, neither can
it be inferred from the former propositions, if they
had been truly alledged; and therefore all that is for
nothing, and must be intended only to cosen and amuse
the Reader that understands not all the windings of
this labyrinth.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, I am to give an account of what
passed in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council upon this article. For
says E. W.<note place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> the doctrine of Transubstantiation <hi>was
ever believed in the Church, though more fully and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
declared in the</hi> Lateran <hi>Council.</hi> But in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive
it was said,<note place="margin">Letter to a friend pag. 18.</note> that it was <hi>but pretended to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi>
in that Council, <hi>where many things indeed came
then in consultation,</hi> yet <hi>nothing</hi> could be openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.
<hi>Nothing,</hi> (says <hi>Platina)</hi> that is, says my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
<hi>nothing concerning the holy land, and the aids to
be raised for it:</hi> but for all this, there might be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
concerning Transubstantiation. To this I reply,
that it is as true that nothing was done in this question,
as that nothing was done in the matter of the Holy
War; for one was as much decreed as the other. For
if we admit the acts of the Council, that of giving aid


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64671:222"/>
to the Holy Land was decreed in the 69. Canon,<note place="margin">Ad liberandum terram san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam de mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus impiorum. Extrav. de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeis &amp; Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenis. Cum sit.</note> 
                     <hi>alias
71.</hi> So that this answer is not true: But the truth is,
neither the one nor the other was decreed in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
For that I may inform this Gentleman in a thing
which possibly he never heard of; this Council of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi>
was never published, nor any acts of it till <hi>Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus</hi>
published them <hi>A. D. 1538.</hi> For three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this <hi>John Martin</hi> published the Councils, and then
there was no such thing as the acts of the <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council to be found. But you will say, how came
<hi>Cochlaeus</hi> by them?<note place="margin">Vide praefat. Later. Concil. secundum p. Crab.</note> To this the answer is easie: There
were read in the Council sixty Chapters, which to some
did seem easie, to others burdensome; but these were
never approved, but the Council ended in scorn and
mockery, and nothing was concluded, neither of faith
nor manners, nor war, nor aid for the Holy Land, but
only the Pope got mony of the Prelates to give them
leave to depart. But afterwards Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. put
these Chapters, or some of them into the Decretals;
but doth not intitle any of these to the Council of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi>
but only to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> in the Council, which
Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> ignorantly, or wilfully mistaking,
affirms the contrary. But so it is that <hi>Platina</hi> affirms
of the Pope <hi>plurima decreta retulit, improbavit Joachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
libellum, damnavit errores Almerici.</hi> The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
60. heads of decrees in the Council, but no man
says the Council decreed those heads. Now these
heads <hi>Cochlaeus</hi> says he found in an old book in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
And it is no ways probable, that if the Council
had decred those heads, that <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
his Uncles decretal Epistles, which make up so
great a part of the Canon Law, should omit to publish
the decrees of this Council; or that there should be no
acts of this great Council in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and that
there should be no publication of them till about 300.
years after the Council, and that out of a blind corner,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64671:222"/>
and an old unknown Manuscript. But the book shews
its original, it was taken from the Decretals; for it
contains just so many heads, <hi>viz.</hi> LXXII. and is not
any thing of the Council in which only were recited
L. X. heads, and they have the same beginnings and
endings, and the same notes and observations in the
middle of the Chapters: which shews plainly they
were a meer force of the Decretals. The consequent
of all which is plainly this, that there was no decree
made in the Council, but every thing was left unfinish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Council was affrighted by the warlike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of them of <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Pisa,</hi> and all retir'd.
Concerning which affair, the Reader that desires it
may receive further satisfaction, if he read the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitates
Britannicae</hi> in the life of <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> out of
the lesser History of <hi>Matthew Paris;</hi>

and <hi>Godfride</hi> the Monk. But since it is become a
question what was or was not determin'd in this <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Council, I am content to tell them that the same
authority, whether of Pope or Council which made
<hi>Transubstantiation an article of faith, made Rebellion and
Treason to be a duty of Subjects;</hi> for in the same colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Canons they are both decreed and warranted
under the same signature, the one being the first Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and the other the third.</p>
                  <p>The use I shall make of all is this; <hi>Scotus</hi> was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
above to say, that in Scripture there is nothing so
express as to compel us to believe Transubstantiation,
meaning, that without the decree and authority of the
Church, the Scripture was of it self insufficient. And
some others as <hi>Salmeron</hi> notes,<note place="margin">Tract. 16. tom. 9. p. 110.</note> affirm, that <hi>Scripture</hi>
and <hi>Reason</hi> are both insufficient to convince a heretic
in this article; this is to be prov'd <hi>ex Conciliorum defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,
&amp; Patrum traditione,</hi> &amp;c. by the definition of
Councils, and tradition of the Fathers, for it were
easie to answer the places of <hi>Scripture</hi> which are cited,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64671:223"/>
and the <hi>reasons.</hi> Now then, since Scripture alone is
not thought sufficient, nor reasons alone, if the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
of Councils also shall fail them, they will be
strangely to seek for their new article. Now for this
their only Castle of defence is the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council.
Indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> produces the <hi>Roman</hi> Council under
Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the second, in which <hi>Berengarius</hi> was
forc'd to recant his error about the Sacrament, but he
recanted it into a worse error, and such which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> disavows at this day: And therefore
ought not to pretend it as a patron of that doctrine
which she approves not. And for the little Council
under <hi>Greg. 7.</hi> it is just so a general Council, as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholic Church, or a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
is an Universal. But suppose it so for this once;
yet this Council medled not with the <hi>modus, viz.</hi>
Transubstantiation, or the ceasing of its being bread,
but of the Real Presence of Christ under the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which is no part of our question. <hi>Berengarius</hi>
denied it, but we do not, when it is rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
Pope <hi>Nicholaus</hi> himself did not understand the
new article; for it was not fitted for publication until
the time of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, &amp; how nothing of this
was in that Council determin'd, I have already made
appear: and therefore as <hi>Scotus</hi> said, the Scripture alone
could not evict this article; so he also said in his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made for the Doctors that held the first opinion
mentioned before out of <hi>Innocentius: Nec invenitur ubi
Ecclesia istam veritatem determinet solenniter.</hi> Neither
is it found where the Church hath solemnly determin'd
it. And for his own particular, though he was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into captivity by the symbol of Pope <hi>Innocent 3.</hi> for
which by that time was pretended the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. c. 23. Sect. Vnum tamen.</note>
yet he himself said, that before that Council it
was no article of faith: and for this thing <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
reproves him, and imputes ignorance to him, saying,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64671:223"/>
that it was because he had not read the <hi>Roman</hi> Council
under <hi>Greg. 7.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Scotus negat doctrinam de conversione &amp; transubst. esse antiquam. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riquez lib. 8. c. 23. in Marg. ad liter. <hi>h.</hi>
                     </note> nor the consent of the Fathers. And to
this purpose I quoted <hi>Henriquez,</hi> saying, that <hi>Scotus</hi>
saith the doctrine of Transubstantiation is not anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
the Author of the Letter denies that he saith any
such thing of <hi>Scotus:</hi> But I desire him to look once
more, and my Margent will better direct him.</p>
                  <p>What the opinion of <hi>Durandus</hi> was in this Question,
if these Gentlemen will not believe me, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their own friends. But first let it be consider'd
what I said, <hi>viz. that he maintain'd (viz.</hi> in disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<hi>that even after consecration the very matter of bread
remain'd.</hi> 2. <hi>That by reason of the Authority of the
Church, it is not to be held.</hi> 3. <hi>That nevertheless it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it should be so.</hi> 4. <hi>That it is no contradiction, that
the matter of bread should remain, and yet it be Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
too.</hi> 5. <hi>That this were the easier way of solving the
difficulties.</hi> That all this is true, I have no better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
than his own words, which are in his first que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of the eleventh distinction in <hi>quartum numb. 11.
&amp; n. 15.</hi> For indeed the case was very hard with
these learned men, who being pressed by authority,
did bite the file, and submitted their doctrine, but
kept their reason to themselves: and what some in the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> observed of <hi>Scotus,</hi> was true also of
<hi>Durandus</hi> and divers other Schoolmen, with whom it
was usual to deny things with a kind of courtesie. And
therefore <hi>Durandus</hi> in the places cited, though he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
well for his opinion, yet he says the contrary is
<hi>modus tenendus de facto.</hi> But besides that his words
are, as I understand them plain and clear to manifest
his own hearty perswasion, yet I shall not desire to be
believed upon my own account, for fear I be mistaken;
but that I had reason to say it,<note place="margin">Summa. l. 8. c. 23. p. 448. lit. C in Marg.</note> 
                     <hi>Henriquez</hi> shall be my
warrant: <hi>Durandus dist. qu. 3. ait esse probabile sed abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
assertione,</hi> &amp;c. He saith <hi>it is probable, but without


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64671:224"/>
assertion, that in the Eucharist the same matter of bread
remains without quantity.</hi> And a little after he adds
out of <hi>Cajetan, Paludanus</hi> and <hi>Soto,</hi> that this opinion
of <hi>Durandus</hi> is erroneous, but after the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> it seems to be heretical: And yet (he says) it was
held by <hi>Aegidius,</hi> and <hi>Euthymius,</hi> who had the good
luck it seems, to live and die before the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> otherwise they had been in danger of the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
for heretical pravity. But I shall not trouble
my self further in this particular;<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. cap. 13.</note> I am fully vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, who spends a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the confutation of this error of <hi>Durandus,</hi> viz.
that the matter of bread remains, he endeavours to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
his arguments, and gives this censure of him.
<hi>Itaque sententia Durandi haeretica est;</hi> Therefore the
sentence of <hi>Durandus</hi> is heretical, although he be not
to be called a heretic, because he was ready to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce
in the judgment of the Church. So <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
who if he say true, that <hi>Durandus</hi> was ready to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the judgement of the Church, then he does not
say true when he says the Church before his time had
determined against him: but however, that I said true
of him, when I imputed this opinion to him, <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
is my witness. Thus you see I had reason for
what I said, and by these instances it appears how
hardly, and how long the doctrine of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was before it could be swallowed.</p>
                  <p>But I remember that <hi>Salmeron</hi> tells of divers, who
distrusting of Scripture and reason, had rather in this
point rely upon the tradition of the Fathers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I descended to take from them this armour in
which they trusted. And first, to ease a more curious
inquiry, which in a short dissuasive was not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
I us'd the abbreviature of an adversaries confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For <hi>Alphonsus à Castro</hi> confess'd that in ancient
writers there is seldom any mention made of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation:]


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64671:224"/>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Letter.</hi> p. 21.</note> one of my adversaries says this is not
spoken of the thing, but of the name of <hi>Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but if <hi>a Castro</hi> meant this only of the word, he spake
weakly when he said, that the <hi>name or word was seldom
mention'd by the Ancients.</hi> 1. Because it is false that it
was <hi>seldom</hi> mention'd by the Ancients, for the word
was by the Ancient Fathers <hi>never</hi> mention'd. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was not any question of the word where the
thing was agreed; and therefore as this saying so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
had been false, so also if it had been true, it
would have been impertinent. 3. It is but a trifling
artifice to confess the name to be unknown, and by that
means to insinuate that the thing was then under other
names; It is a secret cosenage of an unweary Reader
to bribe him into peace and contentedness for the main
part of the Question, by pleasing him in that part
which it may be makes the biggest noise, though it
be less material. 4. If the thing had been mention'd
by the Ancients, they need not, would not, ought not
to have troubled themselves and others by a new word;
to have still retained the old proposition under the
old words, would have been less suspicious, more
prudent and ingenious: but to bring in a new name is
but the cover for a new doctrine; and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi>
left an excellent precept to the Church to avoid <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanas
vocum novitates,</hi> the prophane newness of
words, that is, it is fit that the mysteries revealed in
Scripture should be preached and taught in the words
of the Scripture, and with that simplicity, openness,
easiness, and candor, and not with new and unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
words, such as is that of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> 5. <hi>A
Castro</hi> did not speak of the name alone; but of the
thing also, <hi>de transubstantiatione panis in Corpus Christi;</hi>
of the Transubstantiation of bread into Christs body;
of this manner of conversion, that is, of this doctrine;
now doctrines consist not in words but things, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64671:225"/>
his last words are faint and weak and guilty;
for being convinc'd of the weakness of his defence of
the thing, he left to himself a subterfuge of words.</p>
                  <p>But let it be how it will with <hi>a Castro,</hi> whom I can
very well spare if he will not be allowed to speak sober
sense, and as a wise man should, we have better and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
testimonies in this affair; <hi>That the Fathers did not</hi>
so much as <hi>touch the matter or thing of Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
said the Jesuits in prison, as is reported by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the modest discourse;</hi> And the great <hi>Erasmus</hi>
who liv'd and died in the Communion of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was as likely as any man of his age to
know what he said, gave this testimony in the present
Question; <hi>In synaxi transubstantiationem sero definivit

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64671:225"/>
Card. <hi>Perron</hi> intends to make advantage of them, I
shall wrest them first out of his hands, and then give
an account of the doctrine of this holy man in the
present article; both out of this place and others.

bread is the <hi>truth,</hi> since the Cake was the <hi>figure</hi> or
the shadow.] To which I answer, that though the
Cake was a figure of the Eucharistical bread, yet so
might that bread be a figure of something else: Just as
<hi>baptism,</hi> I mean, the external rite, which although it
self be but the outward part, and is the <gap reason="foreign">

of the inward washing by the spirit of grace, and
represents our being buried with Christ in his death,
yet it is an accomplishment in some sense of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
figures, by which (according to the doctrine of the
Fathers) it was prefigured. Such as in S. <hi>Peter</hi> the
waters of the deluge, in <hi>Tertullian</hi> were the waters of
<hi>Jordan</hi> into which <hi>Naaman</hi> descended, in S. <hi>Austin</hi> the
waters of sprinkling: These were types, and to these
baptism did succeed, and represented the same thing
which they represented, and effected or exhibited the
thing it did represent, and therefore in this sense they
prefigur'd baptism: And yet that this is but a figure still,
we have S. <hi>Peters</hi> warrant; <hi>The like figure whereunto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away
the filth of the flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>but the answer of a good conscience
towards God.</hi> The waters of the floud were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, a type answering to a type: and
yet even here there is a typical representing, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
part, and beyond that there is the <hi>veritas,</hi> or
the <hi>thing signified</hi> by both. So it is in the oblation
of the Cake, and the Eucharistical bread, that was a
type of this, and this the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64671:226"/>
of that; a type answering to a type, a figure to a
figure; and both of them did and do respectively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
a thing yet more secret. For as S. <hi>Austin</hi> said,
these and those are <hi>divers in the sign,</hi> but <hi>equal in the
thing signified,</hi> divers <hi>in the visible species,</hi> but the same
in <hi>the intelligible signification;</hi> those were promissive,
and these demonstrative, or as others express it, those
were <hi>pronunciative,</hi> and these of the Gospel are <hi>conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stative.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A. D. 1547.</note> So Friar <hi>Gregory of Padua</hi> noted in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent:</hi> And that this was the sense of <hi>Justin M.</hi>
appears to him that considers what he says. 1. He
does not say the <hi>Cake</hi> is a type of the bread, but <hi>the
oblation of the Cake,</hi> that is, that whole rite of offering
a Cake after the Leper was cleansed in token of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
and for his legal purity, was a type of the bread
of the Eucharist, <hi>which for the remembrance of the passion
which he suffer'd for these men whose minds are purged from
all perverseness, Jesus Christ our Lord commanded to make
or do.]</hi> To do what? To do bread? or to make bread?
No, but to make bread to be Eucharistical, to be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of the Passion, to represent the death of Christ:
so that it is not the Cake and the bread that are the
type and the Antitype; but the oblation of the Cake,
was <hi>the figure,</hi> and the Celebration of Christs memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and the Eucharist are <hi>the thing presignified</hi> and
<hi>prefigur'd;</hi> But then it remains, that the Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
bread is but the instrument of a memorial or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordation,
which still supposes something beyond this,
and by this to be figured and represented. For as the
Apostle says, <hi>Our Fathers did eat of the same spiritual
meat,</hi> that is, they eat Christ, but they eat him in figure,
that is, in an external symbol: so do we, only theirs
is abolished, and ours succeeds the old, and shall abide
for ever. Nay the very words us'd by <hi>Justin M.</hi> do
evince this, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, when it is an Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
it is still but <hi>bread;</hi> and therefore there is a


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64671:226"/>
body of which <hi>this</hi> is but an outward argument, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle,
a chanel and conveyance, and that is the body of
Christ; for the Eucharistical bread is both bread, and
Christs body too. For it is a good argument to
say, <hi>this is bread Eucharistical, therefore this is bread;</hi>
and if it be bread still, it must be a figure of the bread
of life; and this is that which I affirmed to be the
sense of <hi>Justin M.</hi> The like expression to this is in his
second Apology; <hi>It is not common bread,</hi> meaning, that
it is sanctified and made Eucharistical. But here, it
may be, the argument will not hold; <hi>it is not common
bread, therefore it is bread:</hi> for I remember that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Perron</hi> hath some instances against this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.
For the Dove that descended upon Christs
head was not a common Dove, and yet it follows not;
therefore this was a Dove. The three that appeared
to <hi>Abraham</hi> were not common men; therefore they
were men, it follows not. This is the sophistry of the
Cardinal, for the confutation of which I have so much
Logic left as to prove this to be a fallacy, and it will
soon appear if it be reduc'd to a regular proposition.
<hi>This bread is not common, therefore this bread is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A propositione tertii adjecti, ad propositio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem secundi adjecti valet consequentia, si subjectum sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponat realiter. Reg. Dialect. Vide Sect. 5. n. 10. <hi>Of Christs real presence and spiritual.</hi>
                     </note> but therefore <hi>this is bread still;</hi> here the
Consequence is good; and is so still, <hi>when the subject
of the proposition is something real,</hi> and not in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
only: Because whatsoever is but in appearance
and pretence, is a <hi>Non-Ens</hi> in respect of that real
thing which it counterfeits. And therefore it follows
not, <hi>This is not a common dove; therefore it is a Dove;</hi>
because if this be model'd into a right proposition, <hi>nihil
supponit;</hi> there is no subject in it, for it cannot in this
case be said, <hi>This Dove is no common Dove;</hi> but <hi>this
which is like a Dove, is not a common Dove;</hi> and <hi>these
persons which look like men, are not common men.</hi> And
the rule for this and the reason too is, <hi>Non entis nulla
sunt praedicata.</hi> To which also this may be added,


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64671:227"/>
that in the proposition as <hi>C. Perron</hi> expresses it, the
negation is not the adjective, but the substantive part
of the praedicate; <hi>It is no common Dove;</hi> where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
term relates to the Dove, not to common; It is
no Dove, and the words <hi>not common</hi> are also aequivocal,
and as it can signifie <hi>extraordinary,</hi> so it can signifie
<hi>Natural.</hi> But if the subject of the proposition be
something real, then the consequent is good; as if
you bring a Pigeon from <hi>Japan,</hi> all red, you may say,
<hi>This is no common Pigeon,</hi> and your argument is still
good; therefore <hi>it is a Pigeon.</hi> So if you take sugred
bread, or bread made of <hi>Indian</hi> wheat, you saying <hi>this
is no common bread,</hi> do mean it is <hi>extraordinary</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual,</hi>
but it is <hi>bread still;</hi> and so if it be said, <hi>this bread
is Eucharistical,</hi> it will follow rightly, therefore <hi>this is
bread.</hi> For in this case the praedicate is only an infinite
or Negative term, but the subject is suppos'd and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd.
And this is also more apparent if the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be affirmative, and the terms be not infinite, as
it is in the present case; <hi>This bread is Eucharistical.</hi> I
have now I suppose clear'd the words of <hi>Justin M.</hi> and
expounded them to his own sense and the truth, but
his sense will further appear in other words which I
principally rely upon in this quotation. For speaking
that of the Prophet <hi>Isai, Panis dabitur ei, &amp; aqua ejus
fidelis;</hi> he hath these words, It appears sufficiently
<hi>[That in this prophecy he speaks of bread which our Lord
Christ hath deliver'd to us to do</hi>

and of the Cup which for the recordation of his bloud he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to them to do, that is [give thanks] or celebrate the
Eucharist.]</hi> These are the words of <hi>Justin:</hi> Where 1. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the first simplicity of the primitive Church,
he treates of this mystery according to the style of the
Evangelists and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and indeed of our Blessed


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64671:227"/>

to be done <hi>in memory of him.</hi> 2. If S. <hi>Justin</hi> had

the bread made his body, though this also would not
have done their work for them; but when he says, he
gave the bread only for the remembrance of his being
made a body, the bread must needs be the sign, figure
and representation of that body. 3. Still he calls it
bread even then when Christ gave it; still it is wine
when the Eucharist is made, when the faithful have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thanks; and if it be bread still, we also grant it to
be Christs body, and then there is a figure and the
thing figured, the one visible and the other invisible;

to be natural nourishment of the body, and therefore to
be Christs body only spiritually, and Sacramentally:
unless it can be two substances at the same time;
Christs body and bread in the Natural sense, which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day will not allow; and if it
were allowed, it would follow that Christs body should
be Transubstantiated into our body, and suffer the
very worst changes which in our eating and digestion

this little answer. First, he puts in the word <hi>exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of his own head, there being no such word in
S. <hi>Macarius</hi> in the words quoted. 2. He makes <gap reason="foreign">

against the mind of S. <hi>Macarius,</hi> and against the
very Grammar of his words. And after all, he studies
to abuse his Author, and yet gets no good by it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
for if it were in the words as he hath invented it,
or some body else for him, yet it makes against him as
much, saying, <hi>bread and wine exhibite Christs body;</hi>
which is indeed true, though not here said by the Saint,
but is directly against the <hi>Roman</hi> article, because it
confesses that to be bread and wine by which Christs
body is exhibited to us: but much more is the whole
testimony of S. <hi>Macarius,</hi> which in the Dissuasive are
translated exactly, as the Reader may see by the
<hi>Greek</hi> words cited in the Margent.</p>
                  <p>There now only remains the authority of S. <hi>Austin,</hi>

five places out of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> to the last of which but
one, he gives this answer; that S. <hi>Austin</hi> hath no such
words in that book, that is, in the 10. book against
<hi>Faustus</hi> the <hi>Manichee.</hi> Concerning which, I am to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Gentleman a little better. These words
<hi>[that which by all men is called a sacrifice, is the sign of

others of S. <hi>Austin</hi> I knit together into a close order,
like a continued discourse; but all of them are S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
words, as appears in the places set down in the
Margent. But this Gentleman car'd not for what
was said by S. <hi>Austin,</hi> he was as well pleased that a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
was false Printed; but to the words he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say. To the first of the other four only he
makes this crude answer; that S. <hi>Austin denied not the
real eating of Christs body in the Eucharist, but only the
eating it in that gross, carnal, and sensible manner, as
the Capharnaites conceiv'd.</hi> To which I reply, that it
is true, that upon occasion of this error S. <hi>Austin</hi> did
speak those words: and although the <hi>Roman</hi> error be
not so gross and dull as that of the <hi>Capharnaites,</hi> yet it
was as false, as unreasonable, and as impossible. And
be the occasion of the words what they are, or can be,
yet upon this occasion S. <hi>Austin</hi> spake words, which as
well confute the <hi>Roman</hi> error as the <hi>Capharnaitical.</hi>
For it is not only false which the men of <hi>Capernaum</hi>
dreamt of, but the <hi>antithesis</hi> to this is that which S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
urges, and which comes home to our question, <hi>[I
have commended to you a sacrament which being spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood shall quicken you:]</hi> But because S. <hi>Austin</hi>
was the most diligent expounder of this mystery
among all the Fathers, I will gratifie my Adversary,
or rather indeed my Unpraejudicate Readers, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some other very clear and unanswerable evidences
of the doctrine of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> agreeing perfectly with
that of our Church. <q>[At this time after manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of our liberty hath shin'd in the resurrection of our Lord
Iesus Christ, <note place="margin">De doctr. Christ. lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> we are not burdened with the heavy operation
of signs, but some few instead of many, but those most
easie to be done, and most glorious to be understood, and
most pure in their observation, our Lord himself, and
the Apostolical discipline hath delivered: such is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Baptism, and the celebration of the body and


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64671:230"/>
bloud of our Lord, which when every one takes, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
whether they may be referr'd, that he may give
them veneration, not with carnal service, but with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
liberty. For as to follow the letter, and to take
the signs for the things signified by them, is a servile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity;
so to interpret the signs unprofitably is an evil
wandring error. But he that understands not what the
sign signifies, but yet understandeth it to be a sign, is not
press'd with servitude. But it is better to be press'd
with unknown signs so they be profitable, than by expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them unprofitably to thrust our necks into the yoke of
slavery, from which they were brought forth.]</q> All this
S. <hi>Austin</hi> spake concerning the sacramental signs, the
bread and the wine in the Eucharist; and if by these
words he does not intend to affirm, that they are the
signs signifying Christs body and bloud; let who
please to undertake it make sense of them, for my part
I cannot.</p>
                  <p>To the same purpose are these other words of his,<note place="margin">Epist. 23.</note>
                     <hi>[Christ is in himself once immolated, and yet in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he is sacrificed not only in the solennities of</hi> Easter,
<hi>but every day with the people. Neither indeed does he
lye who being ask'd, shall answer, that he is sacrificed:
For if the sacraments have not a similitude of those things
of which they are sacraments, they were altogether no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
but commonly for this similitude they take the
names of the things themselves,</hi> sicut ergo secundum
quendam modum, <hi>&amp;c. As therefore after a certain
manner the sacrament of the body of Christ is the body of
Christ, the sacrament of the bloud of Christ is the bloud of
Christ; so the sacrament of faith</hi> (viz. Baptism) <hi>is faith.]</hi>
Christ is but once immolated or sacrificed in himself,
but every day in the sacrament; that properly, this in
figure; that in substance, this in similitude; that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
this sacramentally and spiritually. But
therefore we call this mystery a sacrifice, as we call


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64671:231"/>
the Sacrament Christs body, <hi>viz.</hi> by way of similitude
or after a certain manner, for upon this account the
names of the things are imputed to their very figures.
This is S. <hi>Austins</hi> sense: which indeed he frequently so
expresses. Now I desire it may be observed, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
when S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaking of the Eucharist,
calls it the body and blood of Christ; he oftentimes
adds by way of explication, that he means it, in the
Sacramental, figurative sense; but when ever he calls
it, the figure or the Sacrament of Christs body, he
never offers to explain that by any words, by which
he may signifie such a real or natural being of Christs
body there, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> dreams of; but he
ought not, neither would he have given offence or Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
to the Church, by any such incurious and loose
handling of things, if the Church in his age had
thought of it otherwise, than that it was Christs body in
a Sacramental sense.</p>
                  <p>Though I have remark'd all that is objected by <hi>A. L.</hi>
yet <hi>E. W.</hi> is not satisfied with the quotation out of
<hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> not but that he acknowledges it to be right,<note place="margin">P. 41. Orat. 2. in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha. Jam verò paschlis par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipes erimus, nunc quidem adhuc typicè, tametsi aperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs licet quam in veteri; lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le siquidem pascha (nec e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim dicere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebor) figurae figurae erat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurior.</note>
for he sets down the words in Latin; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
nothing against Transubstantiation. Why so?
because, though the Paschal was a type of a type, a
figure of a figure, yet <hi>[in S.</hi> Gregories <hi>sense Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
under the species of bread may be rightly called a
figure of its own self, more clearly hereafter to be shewed us
in heaven.]</hi> To this pitiful answer the reply is easie.
S. <hi>Gregory</hi> clearly enough expresses himself, that in
the immolation of the Passeover Christ was figured;
that in the Eucharist he still is figured, there more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely,
here more clearly, but yet still but typically,
or in figure; <hi>nunc quidem adhuc typice: here we are
partakers of him typically.</hi> Afterwards we <hi>shall see him
perfectly, meaning in his Fathers Kingdom.</hi> So that the
Saint affirms Christ to be receiv'd by us in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64671:231"/>
after a figurative, or typical manner: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
not after a substantial, as that is oppos'd to figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.
Now of what is this a type? of himself to be
more clearly seen in heaven hereafter. It is very true,
it is so; for this whole ceremony, and <hi>figurative, ritual</hi>
receiving of Christs body here, does prefigure our
more excellent receiving and enjoying him hereafter;
but then it follows that the very proper substance of
Christs body is not here; for <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>shadow</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
cannot be the same, to say a thing that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is a figure of it self <hi>hereafter,</hi> is to be said by no
man but him that cares not what he says.<note place="margin">Lib. de Synod.</note> 
                     <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
est sui ipsius imago,</hi> saith S. <hi>Hilary;</hi> and yet if
it were possible to be otherwise, yet it is a strange
figure or sign of a thing, that what is invisible
should be a sign of what is visible.<note place="margin">De Euchar. l. 2. c. 15. Sect. est igitur tertia.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
being greatly put to it by the Fathers calling the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
the figure of Christs body, says, it is in
some sense a figure of Christs body on the Cross; and
here <hi>E. W.</hi> would affirm out of <hi>Naz.</hi> that it is a figure
of Christs body glorified. Now suppose both these
dreamers say right, then this Sacrament which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you look forwards or backwards is a figure of
Christs body; cannot be that body of which so many
ways it is a figure. So that the whole force of <hi>E. W</hi> s.
answer is this, that if that which is like be the same,
then it is possible that a thing may be a sign of it's self,
and a man may be his own picture, and that which is
invisible may be a sign to give notice to come see a thing
that is visible.</p>
                  <p>I have now expedited this topic of Authority in
in this Question, amongst the many reasons I urged
against Transubstantiation:<note place="margin">E. W. p. 42.</note> (which I suppose to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable,
and if I could have answered them my self,
I would not have produc'd them;) these Gentlemen my
adversaries are pleas'd to take notice but of one; But


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64671:232"/>
by that it may be seen how they could have answered
all the rest, if they had pleased. The argument is
this, every consecrated wafer (saith the Church of
<hi>Rome)</hi> is Christs body; and yet this wafer is not that
wafer, therefore either this, or that is not Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or else Christ hath two natural bodies; for there are
two Wafers.] To this is answered, the multiplication
of wafers does not multiply bodies to Christ, no more
than head and feet infer two souls in a man, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
there are two Gods, one in heaven, and the other
in earth, because heaven and earth are more distinct
than two wafers. To which I reply, that the soul of
man is in the head and feet as in two parts of the body
which is one and whole, and so is but in one place, and
consequently is but one soul. But if the feet were
parted from the body by other bodies intermedial, then
indeed, if there were but one soul in feet and head, the
Gentleman had spoken to the purpose. But here these
wafers are two intire wafers, separate the one from the
other; bodies intermedial put between; and that
which is here is not there; and yet of each of them it is
affirm'd, that it is Christs body; that is, of two wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
and of two thousand wafers, it is at the same time
affirm'd of every one that it is Christs body. Now if
these wafers are <hi>substantially not the same,</hi> not one, but
many; and yet every one of these many is <hi>substantially</hi>
and <hi>properly</hi> Christs body, then these bodies are many,
for they are many of whom it is said, every one distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
and separately, and in its self is Christs body.
2. For his comparing the presence of Christ in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
with the presence of God in heaven, it is spoken
without common wit or sense; for does any man say
that God is in two places, and yet be the same-one
God? Can God be in two places that cannot be in one?
Can he be determin'd and number'd by places, that fills
all places by his presence? or is Christs body in the


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64671:232"/>
Sacrament, as God is in the world, that is, <hi>repletive,</hi>
filling all things alike, spaces void and spaces full, and
there where there is no place, where the measures are
neither time nor place, but only the power and will
of God. This answer, besides that it is weak and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
is also to no purpose, unless the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> will pass over to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and maintain
the Ubiquity of Christs body.<note place="margin">In Ps. 33.</note> Yea but S. <hi>Austin</hi> says
of Christ, <hi>Ferebatur in manibus suis,</hi> &amp;c. he bore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his own hands: and what then? Then though
every wafer be Christs body, yet the multiplication of
wafers does not multiply bodies: for then there would
be two bodies of Christ, when he carried his own body
in his hands. To this I answer, that concerning S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
minde we are already satisfied, but that which he
says here is true, as he spake and intended it; for by his
own rule, the similitudes and figures of things are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called by the name of those things whereof they
are similitudes: Christ bore his own body in his own
hands, when he bore the Sacrament of his body; for
of that also it is true, that it is truly his body in a
Sacramental, spiritual, and real manner, that is, to
all intents and purposes of the holy spirit of God. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the words of S. <hi>Austin</hi> cited by <hi>P. Lombard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Trin. c. 4. in fine P. Lombard dist. 11. lib. 4. ad finem. lit. C.</note>
[We call that the body of Christ which being taken
from the fruits of the Earth, and consecrated by mystic
prayer, we receive in memory of the Lords Passion;
which when by the hands of men it is brought on to
that visible shape, it is not sanctified to become so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a Sacrament, but by the spirit of God working in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly.]
If this be good Catholic doctrine, and if this
confession of this article be right, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is right; but then when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
will not let us alone in this truth and modesty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,

of the Chalice to the Laity, among other opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Cardinal S. <hi>Angelo</hi> answered; that he would
never give a cup full of such deadly poison to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>France,</hi> instead of a medicine, and that it was
better to let them die, than to cure them with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
The Embassador being greatly offended, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
that it was not fit to give the name of poyson to
the bloud of Christ, and to call the holy Apostles poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and the Fathers of the Primitive Church, and
of that which followed for many hundred years, who
with much spiritual profit have ministred the cup of
that bloud to all the people: this was a great and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
yet but a single person, that gave so great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                  <p>One of the greatest scandals that ever were given
to Christendom was given by the Council of <hi>Constance;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sess. 13.</note>
which having acknowledged that Christ administred
this venerable Sacrament under both kinds of bread
and wine, and that in the Primitive Church this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64671:233"/>
was receiv'd of the faithful under both kinds, yet
the Council not only condemns them as heretics, and
to be punished accordingly, who say it is unlawful to
observe the custome and law of giving it in one kinde
only; but under pain of excommunication forbids all
Priests to communicate the people under both kinds.
This last thing is so shameful and so impious, that
<hi>A. L.</hi> directly denies that there is any such thing:
which if it be not an argument of the self-conviction
of the man, and a resolution to abide in his error, and
to deceive the people even against his knowledge, let
all the world judge: for the words of the Councils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
as they are set down by <hi>Carranza,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lugduni. A. D. 1600. apud Hiratium Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. p. 440.</note> at the end of
the decree are these <hi>[Item praecipimus sub poena excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municationis
quod nullus presbyter communicet populum
sub utraque specie panis &amp; vini.]</hi> I need say no more in
this affair: To affirm it necessary to do in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
what Christ did, is called heresie; and to do so
is punished with excommunication. But we who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ, hope we shall communicate with him, and
then we are well enough, especially since the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Sacrament in both kinds, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Commandment to minister and receive it in both
kinds. For if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon their suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
only, that Christ did barely institute confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
do therefore urge it as necessary, it will be a
strange partiality, that the confessed institution by
Christ of the two Sacramental species, shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them as necessary, as the other upon an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
supposition. And if the institution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
in both kinds be not equal to a command, then
there is no command to receive the bread, or indeed,
to receive the Sacrament at all: but it is a meer act of
supererogation, that the Priests do it at all, and an act
of favour and grace, that they give even the bread it
self to the Laity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:64671:234"/>
But besides this, it is not to be endur'd that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only binds her subjects to observe
the decree of abstaining from the cup <hi>jure humano,</hi> and
yet they shall be bound <hi>jure Divino</hi> to believe it to be
just, and specially since the causes of so scandalous an
alteration are not set down in the decree of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
and those which are set down by private Doctors,
besides that they are no record of the Church, they are
ridiculous,<note place="margin">A. D. 1562.</note> weak and contemptible. But as <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis</hi>
said in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> this affair can neither
be regulated by Scripture nor traditions, (for surely it is
against both) <hi>but by wisdom;</hi> wherein because it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to proceed to circumspection, I suppose the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will always be considering, whether
she should give the chalice or no; and because she will
not acknowledge any reason sufficient to give it, she
will be content to keep it away without reason: And
which is worse, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> excommunicates
those Priests that communicate the people in both
kinds;<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Preface to the Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> part 1. Canon comperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus de conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. dist. 2.</note> but the Primitive Church excommunicates
them that receive but in one kind. It is too much that
any part of the Church should so much as in a
single instance administer the Holy Sacrament other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than it is in the institution of Christ; there
being no other warrant for doing the thing at all, but
Christs institution, and therefore no other way of
learning how to do it, but by the same institution by
which all of it is done. And if there can come a case
of necessity, (as if there be no wine, or if a man
cannot endure wine) it is then a disputable matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ought or not to be omitted; for if the necessity
be of Gods making, he is suppos'd to dispense with the
impossibility: But if a man alters what God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
he makes to himself a new institution; for which in
this case there can be no necessity, nor yet excuse. But
suppose either one or other; yet so long as it is, or is


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64671:234"/>
thought a case of necessity, the thing may be hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excus'd, if not actually justified; and because it
can happen but seldom, the matter is not great: let
the institution be observed always where it can. But
then in all cases of possibility let all prepared Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
be invited to receive the body and bloud of Christ
according to his institution; or if that be too much,
at least let all them that desire it, be permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it in Christs way: But that men are not suffered
to do so, that they are driven from it, that they are
called heretic for saying it is their duty to receive it as
Christ gave it and appointed it, that they should be
excommunicated for desiring to communicate in
Christs bloud, by the symbol of his bloud, according
to the order of him that gave his bloud; this is such a
strange piece of Christianity, that it is not easie to
imagine what Antichrist can do more against it, unless
he take it all away. I only desire those persons who
are here concerned to weigh well the words of Christ,
and the consequents of them: <hi>He that breaketh one of
the least of my Commandments, and shall teach men so,</hi>
(and what if he compel men so?) <hi>shall be called the
least in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Canon last mentioned it is answered, that the
Canon speaks not of receiving the sacrament by the
communicants, but of the consummating the sacrifice
by the Priest. To this I reply, that it is true that the
Canon was particularly directed to the Priests, by the
title which themselves put to it; but the Canon
meddles not with the consecrating or not consecrating
in one kind, but of <hi>receiving;</hi> for that is the title of
the Canon. The Priest ought <hi>not to receive the body</hi> of
Christ without the bloud; and in the Canon it self,
<hi>Comperimus autem quod quidam sumpta corporis sacri
portione, à calice sacrati cruoris abstineant.</hi> By which
it plainly appears, that the consecration was intire;


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64671:235"/>
for it was <hi>calix sacrati cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ioris,</hi> the consecrated chalice,
from which out of a fond superstition some. Priests did
abstain; the Canon therefore relates to the sumption
or receiving, not the sacrificing (as these men love to
call it) or consecration, and the sanction it self speaks
indeed of the reception of the sacrament, but not a
word of it as it is in any sense a sacrifice; <hi>aut integra
sacramenta percipiant,</hi> aut ab <hi>integris arceantur.</hi> So
that the distinction of <hi>sacrament</hi> and <hi>sacrifice</hi> in this
Question will be of no use to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For
if Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> (for it was his Canon) knew nothing
of this distinction, it is vainly applied to the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his words; but if he did know of it, then he
hath taken that part which is against the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> for of this mystery as it is a sacrament <hi>Gelasius</hi>
speaks, which therefore must relate to the people as
well as to the Priest. And this Canon is to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
quoted by <hi>Cassander.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In consult. de sacra Commun.</note> And 2. no man is able to
shew that ever Christ appointed one way of receiving
to the Priest, and another to the people. The law
was all one, the example the same, the Rule is simple
and Uniform, and no appearance of difference in the
Scripture, or in the Primitive Church: so that
though the Canon mentions only the Priest, yet it
must by the same reason mean all; there being at that
time no difference known. 3. It is call'd <hi>sacriledge</hi>
to divide one and the same mystery; meaning that to
receive one without the other, is to divide the body
from the bloud, (for the dream of <hi>concomitancy</hi> was not
then found out) and therefore the title of the Canon
is thus express'd, <hi>Corpus Christi sine ejus sanguine sacèr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos
non debet accipere;</hi> and that the so doing, <hi>viz.</hi> by
receiving one without the other, cannot be without
sacriledge. 4. Now suppose at last, that the Priests
only are concern'd in this Canon, yet even then also
they are abundantly reprov'd, because even the Priests


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64671:235"/>
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (unless they consecrate) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
but in one kind. 5. It is also remarkable,
that although in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there is great use
made of the distinction of its being sometime <hi>a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
sometime only <hi>a sacrament,</hi> as <hi>Friar Ant. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi>
said in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> yet the arguments,
by which the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors do usually endeavour to
prove the lawfulness of the half communion, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
this distinction, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Christs ministring
to the Disciples at <hi>Emaus,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Ship, in
which either there is no proof or no consecration in
both kinds, and consequently no sacrifice: for there
is mention made only of <hi>blessing the bread,</hi> for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that which was blessed; and therefore either the
consecration was imperfect, or the reception was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose also the words of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and speak clearly of communicants without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of Priest and People: which distinction,
though it be in this article nothing to the purpose, yet
I observe it to prevent such trifling cavils, which my
Adversaries put me often to fight with. His words
are these: <q>[He <hi>(viz.</hi> the Apostle
S. <hi>Paul)</hi> saith,<note place="margin">In Corinth. 11. Indignum dicet esse Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino qui alitèr mysterium celebrat quam ab eo traditum est. Non enim potest devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus esse qui aliter praesumit quam datum est ab Authore. Ideóque praemonet ut secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ordinem traditum devota mens sit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedentis ad Eucharistiam Domini: quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am futurum est judicium, ut quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum accedit unusquisque. veddat causas in Die Domini Jesu Christi, quia sine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinâ traditionis &amp; conversationis qui accedunt rei sunt corporis &amp; sanguinis Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> that he is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Lord who otherwise <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates</hi>
the mystery than it was
deliver'd by him. For he cannot
be devout that presumes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than it was given by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
Therefore he before admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes,
that according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
delivered, the mind of him
that comes to the Eucharist of
our Lord be devout; for there is a judgment to
come, that as every one comes, so he may render an
account in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, because


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64671:236"/>
they who come without the discipline of the delivery
(or tradition) and of conversation are guilty of the
body and bloud of our Lord.]</q> One of my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
says these words of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
only of the Priest:<note place="margin">A. L. p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> and it appears so, by the
word <hi>celebrat,</hi> not <hi>recipit;</hi> he that celebrates other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than is delivered by Christ. To this I answer,
that first it is plain, and S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> so expresses his
meaning to be of all that receive it, for so he says [that
the mind of him that <hi>cometh to the Eucharist of our Lord</hi>
ought to be devout.] 2. It is an ignorant conceit,
that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> by <hi>celebrat,</hi> means the Priest only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he only can celebrate. For however the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> does now almost impropriate that word to the
Priest, yet in the Primitive Church it was no more
than <hi>recipit</hi> or <hi>accedit ad Eucharistiam,</hi> which appears
not only by S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his expounding it so here,<note place="margin">Serm. 1. de eleemos.</note> but
in S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> speaking to a rich Matron, <hi>Locuples &amp;
dives Dominicum celebrare te credis, &amp; corban omnino
non respicis?</hi> Doest thou who art rich and opulent sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that you <hi>celebrate</hi> the Lords Supper, (or sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice)
who regardest not the poor mans basket? <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brat</hi>
is the word, and <hi>receive</hi> must needs be the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and so it is in S. <hi>Ambrose;</hi> and therefore I did
(as I ought) translate it so. 3. It is yet objected,
that I translate <hi>[aliter quam ab eo traditum est] other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than he appointed;</hi> whereas it should be, <hi>otherwise
than it was given by him.</hi> And this surely is a great
matter, and the Gentleman is very subtle. But if he
be ask'd, whether or no Christ appointed it to be done
as he did, to be given as he gave it? I suppose this
deep and wise note of his will just come to nothing.
But <hi>ab eo traditum est,</hi> of it self signifies, <hi>appointed;</hi>
for this he deliver'd not only by his hands, but by his
commandment of <hi>Hoc facite;</hi> that was his <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Now that all this relates to the whole institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64671:236"/>
and doctrine of Christ in this matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the duplication of the Elements, the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the chalice, as well as the consecrated bread,
appears first by the general terms; <hi>qui aliter mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
celebrat,</hi> he that celebrates otherwise than Christ
delivered. 2. These words are a Commentary upon
that of Saint <hi>Paul, He that eats this bread, and drinks
the Cup of the Lord Unworthily, is guilty of the body and
bloud of the Lord.]</hi> Now hence S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> arguing
that all must be done, as our Lord delivered, says
also that the bread must be eaten, and the cup drunk
as our Lord delivered: and he that does not do both,
does not do what our Lord delivered. 3. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is full to this particular: They
are guilty of the body and bloud of Christ, who came
without the discipline of the delivery and of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, they who receive without due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not after the manner it was delivered, that
is, under the differing symbols of bread and wine.
To which we may add that observation of <hi>Cassander,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Disp. 5. de sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra coena.</note>
and of <hi>Vossius;</hi> that the Apostles represented the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all the faithful, &amp; Christ saying to them, take &amp;
eate, he also said, <hi>Drink ye all of this;</hi> he said not,
<hi>Eat ye all of this;</hi> and therefore if by vertue of these
words, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> the Laity be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to drink, it can never be proved that the
Laity are commanded to eat; <hi>Omnes</hi> is added to
<hi>bibite,</hi> but it is not expresly added to <hi>Accipite &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medite,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. de corp. &amp; sang. Domini. cap. 15.</note>
and therefore <hi>Paschasius Radbertus,</hi> who lived
about eight hundred and twenty years after Christs
incarnation, so expounds the precept without any
haesitation, <hi>Bibite ex hoc omnes, i. e. tam Ministri
quam reliqui credentes,</hi> Drink ye all of this, as well
they that Minister, as the rest of the believers. And
no wonder, since for their so doing they have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and institution of Christ; by which as by an


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64671:237"/>
irrefragable and undeniable argument, the Ancient
Fathers us'd to reprove and condemn all usages which
were not according to it. For saith Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
[If men ought not to break the least of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,<note place="margin">Epist. 63.</note>
how much less those great ones which
belong to the Sacrament of our Lords passion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
or to change it into any thing but that
which was appointed by him?] Now this was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against those who refus'd the hallowed wine, but
took water instead of it; and it is of equal force
against them that give to the Laity no cup at all; but
whatever the instance was or could be, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
it upon the only account of prevaricating
Christs institution. The whole Epistle is worth
reading for a full satisfaction to all wise and sober
Christians; <hi>Ab eo quod Christus Magister &amp; praecepit
&amp; gessit humana &amp; novella institutione decedere,</hi> by a
new and humane institution to depart from what Christ
our Master commanded and did; that the Bishops
would not do; <hi>tamen quoniam quidam,</hi> &amp;c. because
there are some who simply and ignorantly <hi>[In calice
Dominico sanctificando &amp; plebi ministrando non hoc faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt
quod Jesus Christus Dominus &amp; Deus noster sacrificii
hujus author &amp; Doctor fecit &amp; docuit,</hi> &amp;c.] In sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the cup of the Lord, and giving it to the people
do not do what Jesus Christ did and taught, <hi>viz.</hi> they
did not give the cup of wine to the people; therefore
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls them to return <hi>ad radicem &amp; originem
traditionis Dominicae,</hi> to the root and original of the
Lords delivery. Now besides that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> plainly
says, that when the chalice was sanctified, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
ministred to the people; I desire it be considered,
whether or no these words do not plainly reprove the
<hi>Roman</hi> doctrine and practice, in not giving the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
chalice to the people: Do they not recede from
the root and original of Christs institution? Do they


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64671:237"/>
do what Christ did? Do they teach what Christ
taught? Is not their practice quite another thing
than it was at first? Did not the Ancient Church do
otherwise than these men do? And thought themselves
oblig'd to do otherwise? They urg'd the doctrine
and example of our Lord, and the whole Oeconomy
of the Mystery was their warrant and their reason:
for they always believed that a peculiar grace and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
was signified by the symbol of wine; and it was
evident that the chalice was an excellent represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and memorial of the effusion of Christs bloud for
us, and the joyning both the symbols signifies the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
refection and nourishment of our souls, bread and
drink being the natural provisions; and they design
and signifie our redemption more perfectly, the body
being given for our bodies, and the bloud for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our souls, the life of every animal being in the
bloud: and finally, this in the integrity, signifies
and represents Christ to have taken body and soul for
our redemption. For these reasons the <hi>Church of God
always in all her publick communions gave the chalice to
the people for above a thousand years.</hi> This was all I
would have remarked in this so evident a matter, but
that I observed in a short spiteful passage of E. W.
<hi>Pag. 44.</hi> a notorious untruth spoken with ill intent
concerning the Holy Communion as understood by
Protestants. The words are these, <hi>[seeing the fruit
of Protestant Communion is only to stir up faith in the
receiver, I can find no reason why their bit of bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
may not as well work that effect, as to taste of their
wine with it.]</hi> To these words, 1. I say, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
stirring up faith is one of the Divine benefits
and blessings of the Holy Communion, yet it
is falsely said, that the fruit of the Protestant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is only to stir up faith. For in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> it is affirmed, that


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64671:238"/>
                     <hi>the body and bloud of Christ are verily and indeed
taken and received of the faithful in the Lords Supper;
and that our souls are strengthened and refreshed by the
body and bloud of Christ, as our bodies are by the
bread and wine,]</hi> and that of stirring up our faith
is not at all mentioned: So ignorant, so deceitful,
or deceiv'd is E. W. in the doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> But then as for his foolish
sarcasm, calling the hallowed Element a <hi>bit of
bread,</hi> which he does in scorn; he might have
considered, that if we had a mind to find fault
whenever his Church gives us cause, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
wafer is scarce so much as <hi>a bit of bread,</hi> it is
more like Marchpane than common bread, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

the loaves of bread offered in certain Churches for the
use of the sacrifice should be brought from the form
of true bread to so slight and slender a form, which
he calls <hi>Minutias nummulariarum oblatarum,</hi> scraps
of little penies or pieces of money,] and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be called bread, being such which no Nation

But it seems this Section was too hot for them,
they loved not much to meddle with it; and therefore
I shall add no more fuel to their displeasure, but desire
the Reader, who would fully understand what is fit to
be said in this Question,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Chap. 3. Rule 9.</note> to read it in a book of mine
which I called <hi>Ductor dubitantium,</hi> or the <hi>Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
only I must needs observe, that it is an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
comfort to all Protestants, when so manifestly they
have Christ on their side in this Question against the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which I only add, that for
above 700. years after Christ, it was esteemed sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to abstain from the Cup,
and that in the <hi>ordo Romanus</hi> the Communion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
describ'd with the Cup; how it is since, and
how it comes to be so, is too plain. But it seems the
Church hath power to dispense in this affair, because

Now this difficulty being over, all that remains for
my own justification is, that I make it appear that
S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Austin, Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi>
do respectively exhort to the study of the Scriptures,
exhorting even the Laity to do so, and testifie the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the Ancient Church in praying in a known
tongue, and commending this as most useful, and
condemning the contrary as being useless and without
edification. I shall in order set down the doctrine
they deliver in their own words, and then the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
cavils of the adversaries will of themselves come
to nothing.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> commenting upon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
preaching and praying for edification,<note place="margin">35. Homil. in 1 Cor. 14. chap.</note> and so
as to be understood; coming to those words of S. <hi>Paul,
If I pray with my tongue, my spirit prayeth but my mind is
without fruit [you see</hi> (saith he) <hi>how a little extolling
prayer he shews, that he who is such a one (viz.</hi> as the
Apostle there describes) <hi>is not only unprofitable to others,
but also to himself, since his minde is without fruit.]</hi> Now
if a man praying what he understands not, does not,
cannot profit himself; how can he that stands by, who
understands no more, be profited by that which does
him that speaks no good? For God understands though
he does not, and yet he that so prays reaps no benefit to
himself, and therefore neither can any man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
no more. The affirmation is plain, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cogent: To the same purpose are the words of
S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> which <hi>A. L.</hi> himself quotes out of him <hi>[If
one speaks in only the Persian tongue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note>

more than what S. <hi>Paul</hi> said before him; but they all
say, that he who hears and understands not whether it
be the speaker or the scholar,<note place="margin">In 1 Cor. 14.</note> is but a Barbarian. Thus

of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who could not speak his minde in apt

the <hi>Corinthians</hi> exhort the Church
to pray<note n="*" place="margin">Quamvis per se bonum sit ut officia divina celebrentur eâ linguâ quam plebs intelligat, id enim per se confert ad aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem, ut bene probat hic locus. Estius in 1. ep. Corin. cap. 14.</note> and prophecy so as to be

more than S. <hi>Paul</hi> says; and he
could not speak it plainer. And
indeed no man of sense can deny
it, unless he affirms at the same
time that it is better to speak what we understand not,
than what we do; or that it were better to serve God
without that noble faculty than with it; that is,
that the way of a Parrot, and a Jackdaw, were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the way of a man; and that in the service of
God, the Priests and the people are to differ as a man

now? however, that it was so then, and is not so now,
demonstrates that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath in this
material point greatly innovated: Let but the <hi>Roman</hi>

in which it is said, that they must
study to read distinctly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the people may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand:
But now it seems that labour is sav'd. And
when a notorious change was made in this affair, we
can tell by calling to mind the following story. The
<hi>Moravians</hi> did say Mass in the <hi>Slavonian</hi> tongue; for
which <hi>Pope John</hi> the eighth severely reprov'd them, and
commanded them to do so no more; but being better
inform'd, he wrote a letter to their Prince <hi>Sfentopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero,</hi>
in which he affirms, that it is not contrary to
faith and found doctrine to say Mass and other prayers


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64671:242"/>
in the <hi>Slavonian</hi> tongue, and adds this reason; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he that <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> hath made the
others also for his glory; and this also he confirms
with the authority of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s first Epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and some other Scriptures, only he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the <hi>decorum</hi> of the business, the Gospel should
first be said in <hi>Latin</hi> and then in the <hi>Slavonian</hi> tongue.
But just two hundred years after this, the Tables were
turned, and though formerly these things were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
yet so were many things in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church; but upon better examination they
have been corrected. And therefore P. <hi>Gregory</hi> the
seventh wrote to <hi>Vratislaus</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that he could
not permit the celebration of the divine offices in the
<hi>Slavonian</hi> tongue, and he commanded the Prince to
oppose the people herein with all his forces. Here
the world was strangely altered, and yet S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
was not condemned of heresie; and no Council
had decreed that all vulgar languages were prophane;
and no reason can yet be imagined why the change was
made, unless it were to separate the Priest from the
people, by a wall of <hi>Latin,</hi> and to nurse stupendious
ignorance in them, by not permitting to them learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enough to understand their public prayers, in which
every man was greatly concerned. Neither may this
be called a slight matter; for besides that <hi>Gregory</hi> the
seventh thought it so considerable, that it was a just
cause of a war or persecution, (for he commanded the
Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to oppose the people in it with all
his forces;) besides this (I say) to pray to God with the
understanding, is much better, than praying with the
tongue; that alone can be a good prayer, this alone
can never; and then the loss of all those advantages
which are in prayers truly understood, the excellency
of devotion, the passion of desires, the ascent of the
minde to God, the adherence to and acts of confidence


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64671:242"/>
in him, the intellectual conversation with God, most
agreeable to a rational being, the melting affections,
the pulses of the heart to &amp; from God, to and from our
selves, the promoting and exercising of our hopes, all
these and very many more (which can never be intire
but in the prayers and devotions of the hearts, and can
never be in any degree but in the same, in which the
prayers are acts of love and wisdom, of the will and
the understanding) will be lost to the greatest part of
the Catholic Church, if the mouth be set open, and
the soul be gag'd; so that it shall be the word of the
mouth, but not the word of the mind.</p>
                  <p>All these things being added to what was said in this
article by the Dissuasive, will more than make it clear,
that in this article (the consequents of which are very
great) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath causelesly troubled
Christendom, and innovated against the Primitive
Church, and against her own ancient doctrines and
practices, and even against the Apostle: But they care
for none of these things. Some of their own Bigots
profess the thing in the very worst of all these expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for so <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Gifford</hi> in their <hi>Calvino Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismus</hi>
complain that such horrid and stupendious evils
have followed the translation of Scriptures into vulgar
languages, that they are of force enough <hi>ad istas tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slationes

upon the authority Apostolical or Divine, yet they
ought to be taken away. So that it is to no purpose to
urge Scripture, or any argument in the world against
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in this article; for if God himself
command it to be translated, yet it is not sufficient:
and therefore these men must be left to their own way
of understanding, for beyond the law of God, we have
no argument. I will only remind them, that it is a

                  <p>THat society of Christians will not easily be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that think themselves oblig'd to dispute
for the worship of Images, the prohibition of which
was so great a part of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Religion, and is so
infinitely against the nature and spirituality of the
Christian; a thing which every understanding can see
condemned in the Decalogue, &amp; no man can excuse, but
witty persons that can be bound by no words, which
they can interpret to a sense contradictory to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the common: a thing for the hating of, and
abstaining from which the <hi>Jews</hi> were so remark'd by all
the world, and by which as by a distinctive cognisance
they were separated from all other Nations, and which
with perfect resolution they keep to this very day, and
for the not observing of which, they are intolerably
scandaliz'd at those societies of Christians, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any necessity in the thing, without any pretence
of any Law of God, for no good, and for no wise end,
and not without infinite danger, at least, of idolatry,
retain a worship and veneration to some stocks and
stones. Such men as these are too hard for all laws, and
for all arguments; so certain it is, that faith is an
obedience of the will in a conviction of the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
that if in the will and interests of men there be a


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64671:243"/>
perverseness and a non-compliance, and that it is not
bent by prudent and wise flexures and obedience to
God, and the plain words of God in Scripture, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ever prevail, neither <hi>David,</hi> nor his Sling,
nor all the worthies of his army.</p>
                  <p>In this question I have said enough in the Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and also in the <hi>Ductor dubitantium;</hi> but to the
arguments and fulness of the perswasion, they neither
have, nor can they say any thing that is material;
but according to their usual method, like flies they
search up and down, and light upon any place which
they suppose to be sore, or would make their prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
believe so. I shall therefore first vindicate those
few quotations which the Epistles of his brethren ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
against; (for there are many, and those most
pregnant which they take no notice of) as bearing in
them too clear a conviction. 2. I shall answer such
testimonies, which some of them steal out of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
and which they esteem as absolutely their best.
And 3. I shall add something in confirmation of that
truth of God, which I here have undertaken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
                  <p>First, for the questioned quotations against the
worship of images; S. <hi>Cyril</hi> was nam'd in the Dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
as denying that the Christians did give veneration
and worship to the image even of the cross it self, but
no words of S. <hi>Cyril</hi> were quoted; for the denial is not
in express words, but in plain and direct argument:
for being by <hi>Julian</hi> charg'd with worshipping the cross,
S. <hi>Cyril</hi> in behalf of the Christians takes notice of their
using the cross in a religious memory of all good
things, to which by the cross of Christ we are ingag'd,
that is, he owns all that they did, and therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no notice of any thing of <hi>worship,</hi> and making no
answer to that part of the objection, it is certain that
the Christians did not do it, or that he could not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64671:244"/>
them in so doing. But because I quoted no words
of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> I now shall take notice of some words of
his, which do most abundantly clear this particular
by a general rule;<note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet a little more light to this particular; it may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that before S. <hi>Cyrils</hi> time this had been objected by
the <hi>Pagans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thesaur. l. 2. c. 1. &amp; alibi. Vna Natura est deitatis quam solum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo adorare oportet.</note> particularly by <hi>Caecilius,</hi> to which <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
answers by directly denying it, and saying, that
the <hi>Pagans</hi> did rather worship erosses, that is, the
woodden parts of their Gods. The Christians indeed
were by <hi>Tertullian</hi> called <hi>Religiosi crucis,</hi> because they
had it in thankful use and memory, and us'd it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in a symbolical confession of their not being
asham'd, but of their glorying in the real cross of
Christ: But they never worshipped the material cross,
or the figure of it, as appears by S. <hi>Cyrils</hi> owning all
the objections, excepting this only, of which he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confessed the fact, nor offered any justification of
it when it was objected, but professed a doctrine with
which such practice was inconsistent. And the like is
to be said of some other of the Fathers who speak with
great affections and veneration of the cross, meaning,
to exalt the passion of Christ; and in the sense of
S. <hi>Paul</hi> to glory in the cross of Christ, not meaning
the material cross, much less the image of it, which
we blame in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And this very sense
we have expressed in S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Orat. de obitu Tbecdos.</note> 
                     <hi>Sapiens Helena egit,

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64671:244"/>
to the cross materially taken; this were insolent, but
the other is piety. In the same manner also S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>
is by the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, and particularly by
<hi>Gretser,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">E. W. pag 57.</note> and E. W. urg'd for the worshipping Christs
cross. But the book <hi>de cruce &amp; latrone,</hi> whence the
words are cited; <hi>Gretser</hi> and <hi>Possevine</hi> suspect it to be
a spurious issue of some unknown person: It wants a
Father; and sometimes it goes to S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and is
crouded into his Sermons <hi>de Tempore:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Serm. 30.</note> But I shall not
trouble my discourse any farther with such counterfeit
ware. What S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> doctrine was in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of images, is plain enough in his indubitate works,
as is, and shall be remark'd in their several places.</p>
                  <p>The famous testimony of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> against the
very use of images in Churches, being urg'd in the
Dissuasive as an irrefragable argument that the <hi>Roman</hi>

say nothing;<note place="margin">A. L.</note> but that <hi>when S.</hi> Hierome <hi>translated
that Epistle of S.</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>it appears not that this
story was in that Epistle that S.</hi> Hierome <hi>translated;
which is a great argument that that story was foisted into
that Epistle after S.</hi> Hieromes <hi>time.]</hi> A likely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!
but spoken upon slight grounds. <hi>It appears not,</hi>
saith the Objector, <hi>that this story was in it then:</hi> To
whom does it not appear? To <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed it did
not, nor to this Objector who writes after him. <hi>Alan
Cope</hi> denied that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ever wrote any such
Epistle at all, or that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ever translated any
such; but <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> being asham'd of such unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
boldness, found out this more gentle answer,
which here we have from our Objector: well! but
now the case is thus; that <hi>this story</hi> was put into the
Epistle by <hi>some Iconoclast is vehemently suspected by</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine
<hi>and</hi> Baronius. But this Epistle vehemently
burns their fingers, and the live coal sticks close to
them, and they can never shake it off. For 1. who


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64671:245"/>
should add this story to this Epistle? Not any of the
reformed Doctors; for before <hi>Luthers</hi> time many ages,
this Epistle with this story was known, and confessed,
and quoted, in the Manuscript copies of divers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
2. This Epistle was quoted, and set down as
now it is, with this story by <hi>Charles</hi> the great above
DCCC. years ago. 3. And a little after by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Council of <hi>Paris;</hi> only they call the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

7. Who can be supposed to have put in this
story? The <hi>Iconoclasts?</hi> Not the <hi>Greeks,</hi> because if
they had, they would have made use of it for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which they never did in any of their disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against images;<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de imag. cap 9. Sect. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundò quia he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retici.</note> insomuch that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes
advantage of it, because they never objected it. Not
the <hi>Latins</hi> that wrote against images; for though they
were against the worship of images, yet they were not
<hi>Iconoclasts:</hi> Indeed <hi>Claudius Taurinensis</hi> was, but he
could not put this story in, for before his time it was
in, as appears in the book of <hi>Charles</hi> the great before
quoted. These things put together are more than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to prove that this story was written by <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and the whole Epistle was translated by S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
as himself testifies.<note place="margin">In Epist. 61. &amp; 101. ad Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note> But after all this, if there
was any foul play in this whole affair, the cosenage lies
on the other side; for some or other have destroyed the
<hi>Greek</hi> original of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and only the <hi>Latin</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
remain; and in all of them of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s works,


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64671:245"/>
this story still remains. But how the <hi>Greek</hi> came to
be lost, though it be uncertain, yet we have great
cause to suspect the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be the Authors of the
loss: And the cause of this suspicion is the command
made by the Bishops in the seventh Council,<note place="margin">Syn. 7. Act. 8. Can. 9.</note> that all
writings against images should be brought in to the
Bishop of C. P. there to be laid up with the books of
other heretics. It is most likely here it might go
away: But however, the good providence of God hath
kept this record to reprove the follies of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church in this particular.</p>
                  <p>The authority of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> reprehending the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of images,<note place="margin">De moribus Eccles. lib. 1. c. 34.</note> was urg'd from several places of his
writings cited in the Margent. In
his first book <hi>de moribus Ecclesiae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam videbitis quid inter ostentationem &amp; sinceritatem—postremo quid inter super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitionis Sirenas &amp; portum religionis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit.

I have purpos'd to shew in another volume.]</hi> Then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of these evil and superstitious practices of some
Catholics, did reproach the Catholic Church, he says,
<hi>[Now I admonish you that at length you will give over the
reproaching the Catholic Church, by reproaching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of these men, (viz.</hi> worshippers of pictures, and
sepulchers, and livers riotously over the dead,) <hi>whom
she her self condemns, and whom as evil sons she endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to correct.]</hi> By these words now cited, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
plainly, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> affirms that those few
Christians, who in his time did worship pictures, were
not only superstitious, but condemned by the Church.
This the <hi>Letter writer</hi> denies S. <hi>Austin</hi> to have said;
but that he did say so, we have his own words for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Yea, but 2. S. <hi>Austin did not speak of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of pictures alone:</hi> what then? Neither did he of
them alone say they were superstitious, and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vain, hurtful and sacrilegious. But does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that therefore he does not say so at all of these,
because he says it of the others too? <hi>But 3. neither
doth he formally call them superstitions,]</hi> I know not
what this offer of an answer means, certain it is, when
S. <hi>Austin</hi> had complained that many Christians were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
his first instance is of them that worship
pictures and graves. But I perceive this Gentleman
found himself pinch'd beyond remedy, and like a man
fastned by his thumbs at the whipping-post, he wries
his back and shrinks from the blow, though he knows
he cannot get loose.</p>
                  <p>In the Margent of the Dissuasive,<note place="margin">De fide &amp;. symb. c. 7. Contr. Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. c. 13.</note> there were two
other testimonies of S. <hi>Austin</hi> pointed at; but the
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Letter</hi> says, that in these S. <hi>Austin</hi> hath not a word
to any such purpose: That is now to be tried. The
purpose for which they were brought, is to reprove the
doctrine and practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64671:246"/>
matter of images: It was not intended that all these
places should all speak or prove the same particular;
but that which was affirmed in the text being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
verified by the first quotation in the Margent,
the other two are fully pertinent to the main inquiry,
and to condemnation of the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine, as the
first was of the <hi>Roman</hi> practice. The words are these,
<q>[Neither is it to be thought that God is circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in a humane shape, that they who think of him
should fancy a right or a left side, or that because the
Father is said to sit, it is to be supposed, that he does
it with bended knees, lest we fall into that sacriledge,
for which the Apostle Execrates them that change
the glory of the incorruptible God into the similitude
of a corruptible man. For, for a Christian to place
such an image to God in the Church is wickedness,
but much more wicked is it to place it in our heart.]</q>
So S. <hi>Austin.</hi> Now this testimony had been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
made use of in the next Section, as more rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the proper matter of it, as being a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the picturing of God; but here it serves
without any sensible error, and where ever it is, it
throws a stone at them, and hits them. But of this
more in the sequel.</p>
                  <p>But the third testimony (however it pleases A. L.
to deny it) does speak home to his part of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Contr. Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. c. 13.</note>
and condemns the <hi>Roman hypothesis:</hi> the words are
these, [See that ye forget not the testimony of your
God which he wrote, or that ye make shapes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:]
But it adds also saying, <hi>Your God is a consuming
fire, and a zealous God.</hi> These words from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Adimantus</hi> propounded; <hi>[Yet remember not only
there, but also here concerning the zeal of God, he so
blames the Scriptures, that he adds that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by our Lord God in those books, concerning the
not worshipping of images; as if for nothing else he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64671:247"/>
that zeal of God, but only because by that very zeal
we are forbidden to worship images. Therefore he would
seem to favour images, which therefore they do that they
might reconcile the good will of the Pagans to their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and mad sect,]</hi> meaning the sect of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi>
who to comply with the <hi>Pagans,</hi> did retain the
worship of images. And now the three testimonies
are verified; and though this was an Unnecessary
trouble to me, and I fear it may be so to my Reader,
yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath got no advantage but this,
that in S. <hi>Austins</hi> sense, that which <hi>Romanists</hi> do now,
the <hi>Manichees</hi> did then; only these did it to comply
with the Heathens, and those out of direct and meer
superstition. But to clear this point in S. <hi>Austins</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the Reader may please to read his 19. book
against <hi>Faustus</hi> the <hi>Manichee, cap. 18.</hi> and the 119.
Epistle against him, <hi>chap. 12.</hi> where he affirms that
the Christians observe that, which the <hi>Jews</hi> did in this,
<hi>viz.</hi> that which was written, <hi>Hear O Israel, the Lord
thy God is one God, thou shalt not make an idol to thee,
and such like things:</hi> and in the latter place, he affirms
that the second Commandment is moral, <hi>viz.</hi> that all
of the Decalogue are so, but only the fourth. I add a
third as pregnant as any of the rest: for in his first
book <hi>de consensu Evangelistarum,</hi> speaking of some who
had fallen into error upon occasion of the pictures of
S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he says, <hi>Sic nempe errare merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
qui Christum &amp; Apostolos ejus non in sanctis condicibus
sed in pictis parietibus quaesiverunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Council of <hi>Eliberis</hi> is of great concern in this
Question, and does great effort to the <hi>Roman</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">E. W. pag. 57.</note>
E. W. takes notice of it, and his best answer to
it is, that it hath often been answered already. He
says true; it hath been answered both often and many
ways. The Council was in the year 305. of 19. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
who in the 36. Canon, decreed this <hi>[placuit pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturas


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64671:247"/>
in Ecclesiis esse non debere.]</hi> It hath pleas'd us
that pictures ought not to be in Churches; That's
the decree: The reason they give is, <hi>ne quod colitur &amp;
adoratur in parietibus depingatur,</hi> lest that which is
worshipped be painted on the walls. So that there are
two propositions; 1. Pictures ought not to be in
Churches. 2. That which is worshipped ought not to
be painted upon walls.<note place="margin">Pag. 57.</note> E. W. hath a very learned
Note upon this Canon. <hi>Mark, first the Council suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
worship and adoration due to pictures, ne quod colitur
&amp; adoratur.</hi> By which mark, E. W. confesses that
pictures are the object of his adoration, and that the
Council took no care and made no provision for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, (who is and ought to be worshipp'd and
ador'd in Churches, <hi>&amp; illi soli servies)</hi> but only were
good husbands for the pictures for fear, 1. they should
be spoiled by the moisture of the walls, or 2. defaced
by the Heathen; the first of these is <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> the
latter is <hi>Perrons</hi> answer: But too childish to need a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
consideration. But how easie had it been for
them to have commanded that all their pictures should
have been in frames, upon boards or cloth, as it is in
many Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places. 2. Why
should the Bishops forbid pictures to be in Churches;
for fear of spoiling one kind of them, they might have
permitted others, though not these. 3. Why should
any man be so vain as to think, that in that age, in
which the Christians were in perpetual disputes against
the Heathens for worshipping pictures and images,
they should be so curious to preserve their pictures,
and reserve them for adoration. 4. But then to make
pictures to be the subject of that caution, <hi>ne quod coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
&amp; adoratur,</hi> and not to suppose God and his
Christ to be the subject of it, is so unlike the religion
of Christians, the piety of those ages, the Oeconomy
of the Church, and the analogy of the Commandment,


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64671:248"/>
that it betrays a refractory and heretical spirit in him,
that shall so perversely invent an Unreasonable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
rather than yield to so pregnant and easie
testimony. But some are wiser, and consider, that
the Council takes not care that pictures be not spoil'd,
but <hi>that they be not in the Churches;</hi> and that what is
adorable <hi>be not there painted, and not,</hi> be not <hi>there
spoiled.</hi> The not painting them is the utmost of their
design, not the preserving them; for we see vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them every where painted on walls, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
well enough, and easily repair'd upon decay,
therefore this is too childish; to blot them
out for fear they be spoiled, and not to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Churches for fear they be taken out. <hi>Agobardus</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> above 800. years since cited this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
in a book of his which he wrote <hi>de picturis &amp; imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi>
which was published by <hi>Papirius Massonus;</hi>
and thus illustrates it, <hi>Recte</hi> (saith he) <hi>nimirum ob
hujusmodi evacuandam superstitionem ab Orthodoxis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus
definitum est picturas in Ecclesia fieri non debere
[Nec] quod eolitur &amp; adoratur in parietibus deping atur.</hi>
Where first he expresly affirms these Fathers in this
Canon to have intended only rooting up this supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not the ridiculous preserving the pictures. So
it was Understood then. But then <hi>2. Agobardus</hi> reads
it, <hi>Nec,</hi> not <hi>[Ne] quod colitur,</hi> which reading makes
the latter part of the Canon, to be part of the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no reason of the former decree; pictures must
not be made in Churches, neither ought that to be
painted upon walls which is worshipped and adored.
This was the doctrine and sentiment of the wise and
good men above 800. years since. By which also the
Unreasonable supposition of <hi>Baronius,</hi> that the Canon
is not genuine, is plainly confuted; this Canon not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only in all copies of that Council, but own'd for
such by <hi>Agobardus</hi> so many ages before <hi>Baronius,</hi> and


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64671:248"/>
so many ages after the Council. And he is yet <hi>farther</hi>
reproved by Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who tells a story, that
in <hi>Granada</hi> in memory of this Council, they use frames
for pictures, and paint none upon the wall at this day.
It seems they in <hi>Granada</hi> are taught to understand that
Canon according unto the sense of the Patrons of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and to mistake the plain meaning of the Council.
For the Council did not forbid only to paint upon the
walls, for that according to the common reading is
but accidental to the decree; but the Council com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that no picture should be in Churches. Now-then
let this Canon be confronted with the Council of
<hi>Trent, Sess. 25. decret. de S. S. invoc. [Imagines Christi,
Deiparae virginis, &amp; aliorum sanctorum in Templis praeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
habendas &amp; retinendas,</hi> that the images of Christ,
and of the Virgin Mother of God, and of other Saints
be had and kept especially in Churches:] and in the
world there cannot be a greater contradiction between
two, than there is between <hi>Eliberis</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> the old
and the new Church: for the new Church not only
commands pictures and images to be kept in Churches,
but paints them upon walls, and neither fears thieves
nor moisture. There are divers other little answers
amongst the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors to this uneasie objection;
but they are only such as venture at the telling the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
reasons why the Council so decreed; as <hi>Alan Cope</hi>
saith, it was so decreed, lest the Christians should
take them for Gods, or lest the Heathen should think
the Christians worshipped them; so <hi>Sanders.</hi> But it
matters not for what reason they decreed: Only if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these say true, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Perron</hi> are
false in their conjectures of the reason. But it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not; for suppose all these reasons were concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in the decree, yet the decree it self is not observ'd
at this day in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but a doctrine and
practice quite contrary introduced. And therefore


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64671:249"/>
my opinion is,<note place="margin">Ioc. Theol. lib. 5. c. 4.</note> that <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> answers best, <hi>[aut
nimis duras aut parum rationi consentaneas a Consiliis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincialibus
interdum editas, non est negandum. Qualis
illa non impudenter modo verum etiam impie a Consilio
Elibertino de tollendis imaginibus.</hi> By this we may see
not only how irreverently the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors use the
Fathers when they are not for their turns; but we may
also perceive how the Canon condemns the <hi>Roman</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and practice in the matter of images.</p>
                  <p>The next inquiry is concerning matter of History,
relating to the second Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> in the East, and
that of <hi>Francfurt</hi> in the West. In the Dissuasive it
was said, that <hi>Eginardus, Hincmarus, Aventinus,</hi> &amp;c.
affirmed, 1. That the Bishops assembled at <hi>Francfurt,</hi>
and condemned the Synod of <hi>Nice.</hi> 2. That they
commanded it should not be called a General Council.
3. They published a book under the name of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
confuting that Unchristian Assembly. These
things were said out of these Authors, not supposing
that every thing of this should be prov'd from every one
of them, but the whole of it by its several parts from
all these put together.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Bishops of <hi>Francfurt</hi> condemned the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of <hi>Nice</hi> or the seventh General. Whether the
Dissuasive hath said this truly out of the Authors quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, we need no further proof, but the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. c. 14. Sect. secundò quia.</note> 
                     <hi>Auctores antiqui omnes conveniunt in
hoc, quod in concilio Francofordiensi sit reprobata Synodus
VII. quae decreverat imagines adorandas. Ita Hincmarus,
Aimoinus, Rhegino, Ado, &amp; alii passim docent.</hi> So
that if the objector blames the Dissuasive for alledging
these authorities, let him first blame <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who
confesses that to be true, which the Dissuasive here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms.
Now that by the VII. Synod <hi>Bellarmine</hi> means
the II. <hi>Nicene,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sect. neque ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat.</note> appears by his own words in the same

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64671:249"/>
vere reprobatam Nicaenam II. Synodum; sed per errorem,
&amp; materialiter,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was in the right;
not only those which the Dissuasive quoted, but all
<hi>the Ancient writers</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> So the Author of
the life of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, speaking of the Council
of <hi>Francfurt;</hi> [There Queen <hi>Fastrada</hi> died. <hi>Pseudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synodus

more were necessary, but these are they whom the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive
quoted, and some more; against this truth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
material can be said, only that <hi>Hincmarus</hi> and
<hi>Aimoinus</hi> (which are two whom the Dissuasive quotes)
do not say that the Synod of <hi>Francfurt</hi> rejected the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Nicene,</hi> but the Synod of C. P. But to this <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
himself answers, that it is true they do so, but
it is by mistake; and that they meant the Council
which was kept at <hi>Nice:</hi> so that the Dissuasive is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by his greatest adversary. But <hi>David Blondel</hi>
answers this objection, by saying that C. P. being the
head of the Eastern Empire, these Authors us'd the
name of the Imperial city for the provinces under it:
which answer though it be ingenious, yet I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the error came first from the Council of
<hi>Francfurt,</hi> who called it the Synod at C. P. and that
after it, these Authors took it up: but that error was
not great, but always excusable, if not warrantable;


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64671:250"/>
because the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was first appointed
to be at C. P. but by reason of the tumults of the
people, was translated to <hi>Nice.</hi> But to proceed,
That <hi>Blondus</hi> (whom the Dissuasive also quotes) saith,
the Synod of <hi>Francfurt</hi> abrogated the seventh Synod,
the objector confesses, and adds, that it confuted the
<hi>Felician</hi> heresie for taking away of images: concerning
which, lest the less wary Reader should suppose the
Synod of <hi>Francfurt</hi> to have determin'd for images, as
<hi>Alan Cope, Gregory de Valentia, Vasquez, Suarez,</hi> and
<hi>Binius</hi> would fain have the world believe; I shall note,
that the Synod of <hi>Francfurt</hi> did at the same time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Heresie of <hi>Felix Urgetitanus,</hi> which was,
<hi>that Christ was the adopted son of God.</hi> Now because in
this Synod were condemned the breakers of Images,
and the worshippers of images; some ignorantly
(amongst which is this Gentleman the objector) have
suppos'd that the <hi>Felician</hi> Heresie was that of the <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noclasts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Now for the second thing which the Dissuasive
said from these Authors; that the Fathers at <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt</hi>
commanded that the second <hi>Nicene should not be
called a general Council,</hi> that matter is sufficiently
cleared in the proof of the first particular; for if they
abrogated it, and called it <hi>pseudosynodum,</hi> and decreed
against it; <hi>hoc ipso,</hi> they caused it should not be, or
be called a General Synod. But I shall declare what
the Synod did in the words of <hi>Adhelmus Benedictinus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In annal.</note>
                     <hi>Synodus etiam quae paucos ante annos C. P. sub Helena &amp;
Constantino filio ejus congregata, &amp; ab ipsis non tantum
septima, verum etiam Universalis est appellata, ut nec sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima
nec Universalis diceretur, habereturque quasi super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacua,
in totum ab omnibus abdicata est.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Now for the third thing, which the Dissuasive
said, that they published a book under the name of the
Emperor; I am to answer that such a book about that


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64671:250"/>
time, within three or four years of it, was published
in the name of the Emperor, is notoriously known,
and there is great reason to believe it was written three
or four years befor the Synod, and sent by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to the Pope; but that divers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
did endeavour to perswade the world that the Emperor
did not write it, but that it was written by the Synod,
and contains the acts of the Synod, but published un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Emperors name. Now this the Dissuasive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the authority of <hi>Hincmarus,</hi> who does affirm
it,<note place="margin">Vide supra. Sect. primò quia.</note> and of the same opinion is <hi>Bellarmine; Scripti vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur
in Synodo Francofordiensi &amp; acta continere synodi
Francofordiensis: &amp; enim asserit Hincmarus ejus tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
Author.]</hi> So that by all this the Reader may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see how careful the Dissuasive was in what was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
and how careless this Gentleman is of what he
objects: Only this I add, that though it be said that
this book contained the acts of the Synod of <hi>Francfurt,</hi>
though it might be partly true, yet not wholly. For
this Synod did indeed do so much against that of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and was so decretory against the worship of
images, <hi>(quod omnino Ecclesia Dei execratur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A. D. 793.</note> said
<hi>Hoveden,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster)</hi> that it is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
suspected, that the Patrons of Images (the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
knows whom I mean) have taken a timely course
with it, so that the monuments of it are not to be seen,
nor yet a famous and excellent Epistle of <hi>Alcuinus</hi>
written against the <hi>Greek</hi> Synod, though his other
works are in a large volume carefully enough preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>It was urg'd as an argument <hi>a minori ad majus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of making of images.</note> that
in the Primitive Church it was accounted unlawful to
make images; and therefore it was impossible that the
worship of images should then be the doctrine or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Catholic Church.<note place="margin">A. L. p. 27.</note> To this purpose <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Alexandrinus, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> were alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64671:251"/>
First for <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of whom the Letter says,
that he said no such thing: sure it is, this man did not
care what he said; supposing it sufficient to pass the
common Reader, to say <hi>Tertullian</hi> did not say for what
he is alledged: for more will believe him, than exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
him. But the words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> shall manifest
the strange confidence of this person. The Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> are only noted in the Margent,
but the words were not cited, but now they must, to
justifie me and themselves.<note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> 1. That reference to <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi>
book of idolatry, the objector takes no notice
of, as knowing it would reproach him too plainly: see
the words, [the artificers of statues and images, and
all kind of <hi>representations,</hi>

world,] and when he had given the Etymology of an
Idol, saying <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is <hi>formula,</hi> he adds, <hi>Igitur omnis
forma vel formula idolum se dici exposcit: Inde omnis Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
artifex ejusdem &amp; Unius est criminis.</hi> And a little
before. <hi>Exinde jam caput facta est Idololatriae ars omnis
quae Idolum quoquo modo edit.</hi> And in the beginning of
the fourth chapter, <hi>Idolum tam fieri quam coli Deus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet.
Quanto praecedit ut fiat quod coli possit, tanto pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
est ne fiat si coli non licet.</hi> And again, <hi>toto mundo
ejusmodi artibus interdixit servis Dei.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he brings in some or other objecting; <hi>Sed ait qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
adversus similitudinis interdictae propositionem, cur
ergo Moses in eremo simulachrum serpentis ex aere fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit?</hi>
To this at last he answers. <hi>Si eundem Deum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servas
habes legem ejus, ne feceris similitudinem, si &amp;
praeceptum factae postea similitudinis respicis &amp; tu imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Moysen. Ne facias adversus legem simulachrum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod,
nisi &amp; tibi Deus jusserit.</hi> Now here is no subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for any one: For <hi>Tertullian</hi> first fays, the Devil
brought into the world all the artists and makers of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
images and all sorts of similitudes. 2. He
makes all these to be the same with Idols. And 3. that


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64671:251"/>
God as well forbad the making of these and the worship
of them, and that the maker is guilty of the same
crime; and lastly I add, his definition of Idolatry,
<hi>Idololatria est omnis circa omne idolum famulatus &amp; servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
Every image is an idol, and every service and
obeysance about any or every idol is idolatry. I hope
all this put together will convince the Gentlemen that
denied it, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath said some such thing as
the Dissuasive quoted him for. Now for the other
place quoted,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. advers. Marc. c. 22.</note> the words are these; <hi>proinde &amp; similitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem
vetans fieri omnium quae in coelo &amp; in terra &amp; in
aquis, ostendit &amp; causas, idololatriae scilicet substantiam
exhibentes.</hi> God forbidding all similitude to be made
of things in Heaven and Earth, and in the Waters,
shews the causes that restrain idolatry: the causes of
idolatry he more fully described in the fore-cited place;
<hi>Quando enim &amp; sine idolo idololatria fiat:</hi> for he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the making of the images to be the cause of their
worshipping, and he calls this making statues and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<hi>Daemoniis corpora facere.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 22.</note> But there is yet another
place in his books against <hi>Marcion,</hi> where <hi>Tertullian</hi>
affirming that S. <hi>Peter</hi> knew <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> on Mount
<hi>Tabor</hi> by a spiritual extasie, says it upon this reason,
<hi>Nec enim imagines eorum aut statuas populus habuisset
aut similitudines lege prohibente.</hi> The same also is to be
seen in his book <hi>De spectaculis, c. 23. Jam vero ipsum
opus personarum quaero an Deo placeat qui omnem simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem
vetat fieri, quanto magis imaginis suae.</hi> By this
time I hope the Gentleman thinks himself in some
shame, for denying that <hi>Tertullian</hi> said the making of
images to be Unlawful.</p>
                  <p>Now let us see for the other two Authors quoted by
the Dissuasive;<note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> The objector in the Letter says, they
only spake of making the Images of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the
other heathen Gods: but E. W. says he cannot find
those quotations out of <hi>Clemens Alexandria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 54. 55.</note> because


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64671:252"/>
the books quoted are too big, and he could not espy
them. The author of the Letter never examined them,
but took them for granted; but E. W. did search a
little, but not exactly. However he ought not to
have look'd in the sixth book of the <hi>Stromata</hi> for the
words there quoted, but in the <hi>protrepticon,</hi> as I shall
shew by and by. That other quotation in the <hi>Stromata</hi>
is the sixth book, and is only referred to, as to the
question in general against images, for so, S. <hi>Clement</hi>
calls it <hi>spiritual adultery</hi> to make idols or images. Now
to this E. W. says, although he did not find what he
look'd for, yet he knows before-hand, that the word
in the <hi>Latin</hi> translation is <hi>simulachrum,</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
an Idol.<note place="margin">Strom. l. 6. p. 687. edit. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. 1629.</note> It is indeed well guessed of E. W. for the
word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and if he had seen the place, he
now tells us what answer we might have expected.
But I am before-hand with him in this particular, and
out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> have prov'd, <hi>idolum</hi> to be the same
with <hi>formula,</hi> deriv'd from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and consequently
means the same with an image. And he had a good
warrant from the greatest Master of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue.

But it matters not so much what <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> word is

this law of God, says, that God forbad every image

suppose that <hi>idolum</hi> and <hi>imago</hi> were not the same; yet
because the Commandment forbids not only <hi>idolum</hi>

observe the Commandment, who make to themselves,
<hi>viz.</hi> for worship, either one or the other. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to S. <hi>Clement,</hi> of whom our present inquiry is.
And to deal most clearly in this affair, as in all things
else, that out of the <hi>Stromata</hi> of S. <hi>Clement,</hi> that I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

1. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64671:253"/>
how careless and trifling this objector is, minding no

out of S. <hi>Clement. Nobis enim est aperte vetitum falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem

But I will not suppose this to be ignorance in him, but
only want of diligence: however the words are to be

makers of images were turned from their common-wealth:
for not a painter or statuary was admitted, their laws
wholly forbidding them, lest any occasion should be given to
dull men, or that their mind should be turned from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

he quotes the law of God against making images, and
adds, <hi>by which law this was intended, that being content

There it is plain that <hi>Origen</hi> affirms the law

and eternal obligation, that is, not to be spoken to
them only who came out of the terrestrial <hi>Egypt;</hi> and
therefore is of Christian duty. And of the same mind
are S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>

But for the further verification of the testimony from
<hi>Origen</hi> against the worship of images in the Primitive
Church, I thought fit to add the concurrent words of
the prudent and learned <hi>Cassander</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Consult. de imagin. &amp; si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulachris.</note>: <hi>Quantum autem

of this I shall have occasion to speak yet once more.
And so at last all the quotations are found to be exact,
and this Gentleman to be greatly mistaken.</p>
                  <p>From the premisses I infer; if in the Primitive
Church it was accounted unlawful to make images,
certainly it is unimaginable they should worship them,
and the argument is the stronger, if we understand
their opinion rightly; for neither the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
nor yet the Ancient Fathers in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
on them, did absolutely prohibit all making
of images; but all that was made for religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and in order to adoration, according as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in him, who among the <hi>Jews</hi> collected the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
precepts, which <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Latin:</hi>

                  <p>The authorities of these Fathers being rescued from

concerned in the next place to take notice of some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
which my adversaries urge from antiquity,<note place="margin">E. W. pag. 49.</note>


                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:64671:254"/>
to prove that in the Primitive Church they did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
images. Concerning their general Council, <hi>viz.</hi>
the second <hi>Nicene,</hi> I have already made account in the
preceding periods; The great S. <hi>Basil</hi> is with great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
brought into the <hi>Circus,</hi> and made to speak
for images as apertly, plainly and confidently, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
or the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it
self.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> His words are these, <hi>[I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the holy Apostles, and Prophets,
and Martyrs, and in my prayer made
to God call upon them, that by their
intercession God may be propitious
unto me. Whereupon I honour and adore the characters of
their images; and especially those things being delivered
from the holy Apostles, and not prohibited, but are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
or seen in all our Churches.]</hi> Now I confess these
words are home enough, and do their business at the
first sight; and if they prove right, S. <hi>Basil</hi> is on their
side, and therefore E. W. with great noise and preface
insults, and calls them Unanswerable. The words
he says are found in S. <hi>Basils 205.</hi> Epistle <hi>ad Julianum.</hi>
I presently consulted S. <hi>Basils</hi> works, such as I had
with me in the Country, of the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition by <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard
1547.</hi> and there I found that S. <hi>Basil</hi> had not 205.
Epistles in all; the number of all written by him and
to him being but 180. of which, that to <hi>Julianus</hi> is one,
<hi>viz.</hi> Epistle 166. and in that there is not one word to
any such purpose as is here pretended. I was then put
to a <hi>melius inquirendum. Bellarmine</hi> (though both he,
and <hi>Lindan</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> cry up this authority as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable)
quotes this authority not upon his own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,<note place="margin">Appendix ad Tract. de cultu imaginum in prooem. ante Cap. 1. &amp; in Cap. 4.</note>
but as taking it from the report of a book publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
1596, called <hi>Synodus Parisiensis,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
calls, <hi>Unworthy to see the light.</hi> From hence arises this
great noise; and the fountain being confessedly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
what wholsome thing can be expected thence?


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64671:254"/>
But in all the first and voluminous disputations of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
upon this Question, he made no use of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
he never saw any such thing in S. <hi>Basils</hi> works,
or it is not to be imagined that he would have omitted
it. But the words are in no ancient Edition of S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi>
nor in any Manuscript that is known in the world.
2. <hi>Iohn Damascen,</hi> and <hi>Germanus</hi> Bishop of C. P. who
wrote for the worship of images, and are the most
learned of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> that were abus'd in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
yet they never urg'd this authority of S. <hi>Basil,</hi>
which would have been more to their purpose than all
that they said beside. 3. The first mention of this is
in an Epistle of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> to the Emperors in the
seventh Synod, and that makes the business more sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious;
that when the <hi>Greek</hi> writers knew nothing of
it, a <hi>Latin</hi> Bishop, a stranger, not very well skill'd
in Antiquity, should find this out, which no man ever
saw before him, nor since in any Copy of S. <hi>Basils</hi>
works: But in the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council such forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as these were many and notorious. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Great is there quoted as Author of an Epistle <hi>de vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione
imaginum;</hi> when it is notorious, it was writ by
<hi>Gregory</hi> III. and there were many <hi>Basils,</hi> and any one
of that name would serve to give countenance to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod; but in S. <hi>Basil</hi> the
Great there is not one word like it. And therefore
they who set forth S. <hi>Basils</hi> works at <hi>Paris 1618.</hi> who
either could not, or ought not to have been ignorant
of so vile a cheat, were infinitely to blame to publish
this as the issue of the right S. <hi>Basil,</hi> without any mark
of difference, or note of inquiry.</p>
                  <p>There is also another saying of S. <hi>Basil,</hi> of which
the <hi>Roman</hi> writers make much, and the words are by
<hi>Damascen</hi> imputed to the Great S. <hi>Basil; Imaginis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
exemplum transit,</hi> which indeed S. <hi>Basil</hi> speaks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the statues of the Emperors, and of that civil ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64671:255"/>
which by consent and custom of the world did
pass to the Emperor, and he accepted it so; but this
is no argument for religious images put up to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, he says not, the honour of any such
images passes to God; for God hath declar'd against it,
(as will appear in the following periods) and therefore
from hence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can have no argument,
no fair pretence; and yet upon this very account, and
the too much complying with the Heathen rites and
manners, and the secular customs of the Empire, the
veneration of images came into Churches. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it be admitted to be true; yet although this may
do some countenance to <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
way of worshipping the image and the sampler
with the same worship; yet this can never be urg'd by
all those more moderate <hi>Papists,</hi> who make the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to an image of a lower kind: For if it be not the
same worship, then they that worship images, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God and his Saints by the image not as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
but give to them no more than the image it self
deserves: let them take which part they please, so
that they will but publickly own it. But let this be
as it will, and let it be granted true, that the honour
done to the image can pass to the sampler, yet this is
but an arbitrary thing, and a King may esteem it so if
he please, but if the King forbids any image to be
made of him, and counts it a dishonour to him, then
I hope it is; and that's the case now, for God hath
forbidden any such way of passing honour to him by an
image of him; and he hath forbidden it in the second
Commandement, and this is confessed by <hi>Vasquez</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Tom. 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in 3. part. Qu. 25. art. 3. disp. 94. c. 3.</note>: So
that upon this account, for all the pretence of the
same motion to the image and the sampler, to pass such
a worship to God is no better than the doing as the
Heathen did, when they worshipped <hi>Mercury</hi> by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stones at him.</p>

                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:64671:255"/>
An other authority brought by E. W. for veneration
of images,<note place="margin">Pag. 50.</note> is from <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but himself damns it in
the Margent, with and without ingenuity; for inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
saying, that he does not affirm it to be the
Great <hi>Athanasius,</hi> yet most disingenuously he adds,
<hi>valeat quantum valere potest,</hi> that is, they that will be
cosened let them. And indeed these Questions and
Answers to <hi>Antiochus</hi> are notoriously spurious, for in
them are quoted S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nyssen,
Chrysostom, Scala Johannis, Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi>
who were after <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and the book is rejected by

such stuff as this the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors are forc'd to build
their <hi>Babel;</hi> and E. W. in page 56. quotes the same

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, but S. <hi>Chrysostoms Liturgy is very clear,</hi> for it
is said, that <hi>the Priest turns himself to our Saviours pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and bows his head before the picture, and says this
prayer;</hi> These words indeed are very plain, but it is
not plain that these are S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> words, for their
are none such in S. <hi>Chrysostoms Liturgy</hi> in the Editions
of it by <hi>Claudius de Saintes,</hi> or <hi>Morellus,</hi> and <hi>Claudius

that this Liturgy begun and compos'd by S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>

divers persons are there commemorated, who

nothing like it, either under the title <hi>de Simone</hi> or <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrate.</hi>
And he says true, but with a shameful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to calumniate me, and deceive his Reader; as if
I had quoted a thing that <hi>Theodoret</hi> said not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reader ought not to believe me. But since
in the Dissuasive <hi>Theodoret</hi> was only quoted <hi>lib. 5. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64671:256"/>
all <hi>Simons</hi> heresies were to be look'd for, he should
have found that which I referred to. But why E. W.
denies S. <hi>Austin</hi> to have reported that for which he is
quoted, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> brought in some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to be worshipped, I cannot conjecture, neither do
I think himself can tell; but the words are plain in the
place quoted, according to the intention of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive.
But that he may yet seem to lay more load
upon me, he very learnedly says that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in the
place quoted by me, says not a word of <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
being Author of images; and would have his Reader
believe that I mistook <hi>Simon Magus</hi> for <hi>Simon Irenaeus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vide Irenae. lib. 1. adv. haeres. c. 23. &amp; 24.</note>
But the good man I suppose wrote this after supper,
and could not then read or consider that the testimony
of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was brought in to no such purpose; neither
did it relate to any <hi>Simon</hi> at all, but to the <hi>Gnostics</hi> or
<hi>Carpocratians,</hi> who also were very early and very deep
in this impiety; only they did not worship the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Selene,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vbi suprà hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 7.</note> but of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as S. <hi>Austin</hi> testifies of them;
But that which he remarks in them is this, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellina,</hi>
one of their sect, worshipped the pictures of
<hi>Iesus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>adorando, incensumque ponendo,</hi> they did
adore them, and put incense before them: I wish the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would leave to do so, or acknowledge
whose Disciples they are in this thing. The same also
is said by <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> and that the <hi>Carpocratians</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the image of <hi>Iesus</hi> with the Philosophers of the
world, <hi>collocatasque adorant, &amp; gentium mysteria perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt.</hi>
But I doubt that both <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
who took this story from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> went farther in the
Narrative than <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> for he says only that they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the images of Christ, <hi>&amp;c. Et has coronant:</hi> No
more, and yet even for this, for crowning the image of
Christ with flowers<note n="*" place="margin">Iren. reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem circa eas similitèr ut gentes faciunt, i. e. sicut coeterorum illustrium virorum imaginibus consueverunt facere.</note>, though they did not so much as


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64671:257"/>
is now adays done at <hi>Rome;</hi> S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> made an outcry
and reckoned them in the black Catalogue of heretics,
not for joyning Christs image with that of <hi>Homer</hi> and
<hi>Aristotle, Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> but even for crowning
Christs image with flowers and coronets, as they also
did those of the Philosophers; for though this may be
innocent, yet the other was a thing not known in the
religion of any, that were called Christians, till <hi>Simon</hi>
and <hi>Carpocrates</hi> began to teach the world.</p>
                  <p>2. We find the wisest and the most sober of the
Heathens speaking against the use of images in their
religious rites. So <hi>Varro,</hi> when he had said that the old
<hi>Romans</hi> had for 170. years worshipped the Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
picture or image, adds, <hi>quod si adhuc mansissent,
castius Dii observarentur,</hi> and gives this reason for it,
<hi>qui primi simulachra Deorum populis posuerunt, &amp; civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus
suis &amp; metum dempsisse, &amp; errorem addidisse.</hi>
The making images of the Gods took away fear from
men and brought in error:<note place="margin">Prudenter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istimavit Deos facile posse in simulachrorum stoliditate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temni.</note> which place S. <hi>Austin</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
commends and explicates it, saying, he wisely
thought that the Gods might easily be despised in the
blockishness of images. The same also was observed
by <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. in Numâ.</note> and he gives this reason, <hi>nefas putantes
augustiora exprimere humilioribus, neque aliter aspirari
ad Deum quam mente posse.</hi> They accounted it impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to express the <hi>Great Beings</hi> with low matter, and
they believed there was no aspiring up to God but by
the mind.] This is a Philosophy which the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> need not be ashamed to learn.</p>
                  <p>3. It was so known a thing, that Christians did abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the use of images in religion, and in their
Churches; that <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor was supposed to
build Temples to Christ,<note place="margin">Aelius Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prid. in Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro Severo. edit. Salmat. p. 120.</note> and to account him as God,
because he commanded that Churches without images
should be made in all Cities, as is related by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:64671:257"/>
4. In all the disputations of the Jews against the
Christians of the Primitive Church, although they
were impatient of having any image, and had detested
all use of them, especially ever since their return from
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and still retained the hatred of them, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the dissolution of their Temple, <hi>even unto superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
(says <hi>Bellarmine;)</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De imag. c. 7. Sect. Ad pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</note> yet they never objected against
Christians their having images in their Churches,
much less their worshipping them. And let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that in all that long disputation between <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tryphon</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> in which the subtle
<hi>Iew</hi> moves every stone, lays all the load he can at the
Christians door, makes all objections, raises all the
envy, gives all the matter of reproach he can against
the Christians, yet he opens not his mouth against
them concerning images. The like is to be observed
in <hi>Tertullians</hi> book against the <hi>Iews;</hi> no mention of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
for there was no such thing amongst the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
they hated them as the <hi>Iews</hi> did; but it is not
imaginable they would have omitted so great a cause
of quarrel. On the other side, when in length of time
images were brought into Churches, the <hi>Iews</hi> forbore
not to upbraid the Christians with it. There was a
dialogue written a little before the time of the seventh
Synod, in which a <hi>Iew</hi> is brought in saying to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
[I have believed all ye say, and I do believe in
the crucified Jesus Christ, that he is the son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God;<note place="margin">Synod. 7. Act. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Scandalizor autem in vos Christiani quia
imagines adoratis,</hi> I am offended at you Christians
that ye worship images; for the Scripture forbids us
every where to make any similitude or graven image.
And it is very observable that in the first and best part
of the <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> called the <hi>Misna,</hi> published
about the end of the second Century, the Christians
are not blam'd about images; which shews they gave
no occasion: but in the third part of the <hi>Talmud</hi> about


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64671:258"/>
the 10. and 11. age after Christ, the Christians are
sufficiently upbraided and reproached in this matter.
In the <hi>Gemara,</hi> which was finished about the end of
the fifth Century, I find that learned men say the <hi>Iews</hi>
call'd the Christian Church <hi>the house of Idolatry;</hi> which
though it may be expounded in relation to images,
which about that time began in some Churches to be
placed and honoured; yet I rather incline to believe,
that they meant it of our worshipping <hi>Jesus</hi> for the true
God and the true <hi>Messias;</hi> for at this day they call all
Christians <hi>Idolaters,</hi> even those that have none, and
can endure no images in their Religion or their
Churches. But now since these periods, it is plain
that the case is altered, and when the learned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of the <hi>Roman</hi> communion write against the <hi>Jews,</hi>
they are forced to make apologies for the scandal they
give to the <hi>Iews</hi> in their worshipping of images, as is to
be seen (besides <hi>Leontius Neopolitanus</hi> of <hi>Cyprus</hi> his
apology which he published for the Christians against
the <hi>Iews;)</hi> in <hi>Ludovicus Carretus</hi> his Epistle, in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Amana,</hi> and <hi>Fabianus Fioghus</hi> his Catechetical
Dialogues. But I suppose this case is very plain, and
is a great conviction of the innovation in this matter
made by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The matter of worshipping images looks so ill,
so like Idolatry, so like the forbidden practices of the
Heathens, that it was infinitely reasonable, that if it
were the practice and doctrine of the Primitive
Church, the Primitive Priests and Bishops should at
least have considered, and stated the question how far,
and in what sense it was lawful, and with what inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in what degrees, and with what caution,
and distinctions this might lawfully be done; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
when they preach'd, and wrote Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and explications upon the Decalogue; especially
since there was at least so great a semblance of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64671:258"/>
and contradiction between the commandment and
any such practice; God forbidding any image &amp; simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to be made of himself, or any thing else in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or in Earth, or in the Sea, and that with such
threatnings and interminations of his severe judgments
against them that did make them for worship, and this
thing being so constantly objected by all those many
that opposed their admission and veneration; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
very strange that none of the Fathers should take
notice of any difficulty in this affair. They objected
the Commandment against the Heathens for doing it;
and yet that they should make no account, or take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
how their worshipping Saints and God himself by
images, should differ from the Heathen superstition
that was the same thing to look upon: This indeed is
very Unlikely. But so it is; <hi>Iustin Martyr, Clemens
Alexandrinus</hi> speak plainly enough of this matter, and
speak plain down-right words against making and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
images, and so careless they were of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
chance, or the present concern of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, that they do not except the image of the true
God, nor the image of Saints and Angels, no not of
<hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Homil. 8. in Exod.</note> or the Blessed <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> her self. Nay <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
expounds the Commandments, and S. <hi>Austin</hi> makes
a professed commentary upon them, but touch'd none
of these things with the top of his finger, only told that
they were all forbidden: we are not so careless now
adays in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but carefully expound
the Commandments against the unsufferable objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Heretics of late, and the Prophets and the
Fathers of old. But yet for all this, a suspicious man
would conclude that in the first 400. years, there was
no need of any such explications, inasmuch as they
had nothing to do with images, which only could make
any such need.</p>
                  <p>6. But then in the next place I consider, that the


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64671:259"/>
second Commandment is so plain, so easie, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
against all the making and worshipping any
image or likeness of any thing, that besides that every
man naturally would understand all such to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
it is so expressed, that upon supposition that
God did intend to forbid it wholly, it could not more
plainly have been expressed. For the prohibition is
absolute and universal, and therefore of all particulars;
and there is no word or sign by the vertue of which it
can with any probability be pretended that any one of
any kind is excepted. Now then to this, when the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to answer they over-do it,
and make the matter the more suspicious. Some of
them answer by saying, that this is no moral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
not obligatory to Christians, but to the
<hi>Iews</hi> only: Others say, that by this Commandment it
is only forbidden to account an image to be very God;
so <hi>Cajetan:</hi> Others say that <hi>an idol</hi> only is forbidden,
and that an image is no idol. Others yet distinguish
the manner of worshipping, saying that the image is
worshipp'd for the Samplers sake, not for its own.
And this worship is by some called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or service;
by others <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; saying that the first is to images of
Saints, the other to God only. And yet with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
Some saying that the image of God is ador'd
with the same kind of adoration that God is; only it is
to the image for Gods sake; so S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi>
and generally his scholars. Others say that it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
kind of <hi>Worship due to Images,</hi> but not at all
Divine; some say it is but a civil worship. And then
it is for the image sake, and so far is <hi>intransitive,</hi> but
whatever is paid more to the image is transitive, and
passes further. And whatsoever it be, it cannot be
agreed how it ought to be paid: whether <hi>properly</hi> or
<hi>improperly, Univocally</hi> or <hi>aequivocally,</hi> for themselves
or for something else, whether <hi>analogically</hi> or <hi>simply,</hi>


                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:64671:259"/>
whether <hi>absolutely</hi> or by <hi>reduction.</hi> And it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answers to the Question, <hi>with
what kind of worship images may be ador'd?</hi> He answers
with this proposition;<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. S. 8. Cap. 25.</note> [The worship which by <hi>it self</hi>
and <hi>properly</hi> is due to images, is a <hi>certain imperfect wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
which <hi>analogically</hi> and <hi>reductively</hi> pertains to <hi>a kind
of that</hi> worship, which is due to the Exemplar:] and
a little after, <hi>to the images a certain inferior worship is
due, and that not all one, but various according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of images.</hi> To the images of Saints is due <hi>dulia
secundum quid,</hi> which if you do not understand, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
in the next words explains most clearly; <hi>dulia
secundum quid,</hi> is as a man may say, <hi>reductive</hi> and <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical.</hi>
But after all this we may be mistaken, and
we cannot tell whom to follow nor what to do in the
case. <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Scholars warrant you to give the
same worship to Gods image as to God: And is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest
way indeed to be understood, and indeed may
quickly be understood to be direct idolatry. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
and others tell you, stay, not so altogether; but
there is a way to agree with S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that it shall be
the same worship, and not the same worship; for it is
the <hi>same by reduction,</hi> that is, it is of the same kind,
and therefore <hi>Divine,</hi> but it is <hi>imperfectly divine,</hi> as if
there could be degrees in Divine worship; that is, as
if any worship could be divine, and yet not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
But if this seems difficult, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> illustrates
it by similitudes. This worship of images is the same
with the worship of the Example, <hi>viz.</hi> of God, or of
Christ, as it happens, just as a painted man is the same
with a living man, and a painted horse with a living
horse, for a painted man and a painted horse differ spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically;
as the true man and the true horse do; and
yet the painted man is no man, and the painted horse
is no horse.] The effect of which discourse is this,
that the worship of images, is but the image of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64671:260"/>
hypocrisie and dissimulation all the way; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
real, but imaginative and phantastical; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
though this gives but a very ill account of the
agreement of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> with their Saints, <hi>Thomas</hi>
and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> yet it is the best way to avoid idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
because they give <hi>no real worship</hi> to images: But
then on the other side, how do they mock God and
Christ, by offering to them that which is nothing;
by pretending to honour them by honouring their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
when the honour they do give to images, is it self
but imaginary, and no more of reality in it, than there
is of humane Nature in the picture of a man. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
if you will not commit down-right idolatry, as
some of their Saints teach you, then you must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to observe these plain distinctions, and first be sure
to remember that when you worship an image, you do
it not <hi>materially,</hi> but <hi>formally;</hi> not as it is <hi>of such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
but as it is <hi>a sign;</hi> next take care that you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what sort of image it is, and then proportion your
right kind to it, that you do not give <hi>latria</hi> to that
where <hi>hyperdulia</hi> is only due; and be careful that if
<hi>doulia</hi> only be due that your worship be not <hi>hyperduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
In the next place consider that the worship to
your image is intransitive but in few cases, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
but to a few Doctors; and therefore when you
have got all these cases together, be sure that in all
other cases it be transitive. But then when the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is pass'd on to the Exemplar, you must consider,
that if it be of the same kind with that which is due
to the Example, yet it must be an imperfect piece of
worship, though the kind be perfect; and that it is but
<hi>analogical,</hi> and it is <hi>reductive,</hi> and it is not <hi>absolute,</hi>
not <hi>simple,</hi> not <hi>by it self;</hi> not by an act to the image di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from that which is to the Example, but one and
the same individual act, with one intention, as to the
supreme kind, though with some little variety, if the


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64671:260"/>
kinds be differing. Now by these easie, ready, clear,
and necessary distinctions, and rules and cases, the
people being fully and perfectly instructed, there is
no possibility that the worship of images should be
against the second Commandment, because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
does not forbid any worship that is <hi>transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
reduct, accidental, consequential, analogical</hi> and
<hi>hyperdulical,</hi> and this is all that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
does by her wisest Doctors teach now adays. But
now after all this, the easiest way of all certainly is to
worship no images, and no manner of way, and
trouble the peoples heads with no distinction; for by
these no man can ever be at peace, or Understand the
Commandment, which without these laborious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
(by which they confess the guilt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
does lie a little too heavy upon them)
would most easily by every man and every woman be
plainly and properly understood. And therefore I
know not whether there be more impiety, or more
fearful caution in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in being so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that the second Commandment be not expos'd to
the eyes and ears of the people; leaving it out of their
manuals, breviaries and Catechisms, as if when they
teach the people to serve God, they had a mind they
should not be tempted to keep all the Commandments.
And when at any time they do set it down, they only
say thus, <hi>Non facies tibi Idolum,</hi> which is a word not
us'd in the second Commandment at all; and if the
word which is there us'd be sometimes translated <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
yet it means no more than <hi>similitude;</hi> or if the
words be of distinct signification, yet because both
are expresly forbidden in that Commandment, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill to represent the Commandment so, as if it were
observ'd according to the intention of that word, yet
the Commandment might be broken, by the not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it according to the intention of the other word,


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64671:261"/>
which they conceal. But of this more by and by.</p>
                  <p>7. I consider that there is very great scandal and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
given to Enemies and strangers to Christianity;
the very <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> with whom the worship of
images is of very ill report, and that upon (at least)
the most probable grounds in the world. Now the
Apostle having commanded all Christians to pursue
those things which are of good report, and to walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly
&amp; charitably towards them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and that we <hi>give no offence neither to the Jew nor to
the Gentile:</hi> Now if we consider, that if the Christian
Church were wholly without images, there would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
perish to the faith or to the charity of the Church,
or to any grace which is in order to Heaven; and that
the spiritual state of the Christian Church may as well
want such Baby ceremonies as the Synagogue did;
and yet on the other side, that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> are
the more, much more estranged from the religion of
Christ Jesus, by the image-worship done by his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
servants;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 13.</note> the consequent will be, that to retain
the worship of images is both against the faith and the
charity of Christians, and puts limits, and retrenches
the borders of the Christian pale.</p>
                  <p>8. It is also very scandalous to Christians, that is,
it makes many, and endangers more to fall into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. But this Gentleman thinks any thing
will pass for argument amongst his own people. And
of this danger S. <hi>Austin</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. 49. q. 3.</note> gives a rational account;
<hi>[No man doubts but idols want all sense: But when they
are plac'd in their seats, in an honourable sublimity, that
they may be attended by them that pray and offer sacrifice,
by the very likeness of living members and senses, although
they be senseless and without life, they affect weak minds,
that they seem to live and feel, especially when the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a multitude is added to it, by which so great a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is bestowed upon them.]</hi> Here is the danger, and
how much is contributed to it in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by clothing their images in rich apparel, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to make them nod their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> head, to twinkle the
eyes, and even to speak, the world is too much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Some such things as these, and the superstitious


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64671:262"/>
talkings and actings of their Priests made great impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
upon my Neighbours in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and they had
such a deep and religious veneration for the image of
our Lady of <hi>Kilbrony,</hi> that a worthy Gentleman, who
is now with God, and knew the deep superstition of
the poor <hi>Irish,</hi> did not distrain upon his Tenants for his
rents, but carried away the image of the female Saint
of <hi>Kilbrony;</hi> and instantly the Priest took care that
the Tenants should redeem the Lady, by a punctual
and speedy paying of their rents; for they thought
themselves Unblessed as long as the image was away;
and therefore they speedily fetch'd away their Ark from
the house of <hi>Obededom,</hi> and were afraid that their Saint
could not help them, when her image was away. Now
if S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have Christians to abstain from <hi>meats
sacrificed to idols,</hi> to avoid the giving offence to weak
brethren, much more ought the Church to avoid
tempting all the weak people of her Communion to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,

such acts, which all their heads can never learn to

                  <p>AGainst all the authorities almost which are or
might be brought to prove the Unlawfulness of
Picturing God the Father, or the Holy Trinity, the
<hi>Roman</hi> Doctors generally give this one answer; That
the Fathers intended by their sayings, to condemn the
picturing of the Divine Essence; but condemn not the
picturing of those symbolical shapes or forms in which
God the Father, or the Holy Ghost, or the Blessed
Trinity are supposed to have appeared. To this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
1. That no man ever intended to paint the essence
of any thing in the world. A man cannot well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
an Essence, and hath no <hi>Idea</hi> of it in his mind,
much less can a Painters Pensil do it. And therefore
it is a vain and impertinent discourse to prove that they
do ill who attempt to paint the Divine Essence.<note place="margin">Vide Plutarch. de Iside &amp; Osir.</note> This


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64671:263"/>
is a subterfuge which none but men out of hope to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their opinion otherwise, can make use of. 2. To
picture God the Father in such symbolical forms in
which he appear'd, is to picture him in no form at all;
for generally both the Schools of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
consent in this, that God the Father never appear'd
in his person; for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, he <hi>is the invisible
God whom no eye hath seen or can see;</hi> He always appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Angels, or by fire, or by storm and tempest, by
a cloud or by a still voice; he spake by his Prophets,
and at last by his Son; but still the adorable majesty
was reserved in the secrets of his glory. 3. The Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> paints the Holy Trinity in forms and symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
shapes in which she never pretends the Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
did appear, as in a face with three Noses and four
Eyes, one body with three heads, and as an old man
with a great beard, and a Popes Crown upon his head,
and holding the two ends of the transverse rafter of the
Cross with Christ leaning on his breast, and the Holy
Spirit hovering over his head: And therefore they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the images of God the Father, &amp; the Holy Trinity,
<hi>figures which</hi> (as is said of <hi>Remphan</hi> and the Heathen
Gods and Goddesses) <hi>themselves have made;</hi> which
therefore must needs be idols by their own definition
of <hi>idolum; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mulachrum rei non existentis;</hi> for never was
there seen any such of the Holy Trinity in Unity, as
they most impiously represent. And if when any thing
is spoken of God in Scripture allegorically, they may
of it make an image to God, they would make many
more Monsters than yet they have found out: For as
<hi>Durandus</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In 3. sent. dist. 9. q. 2. n. 15.</note> well observes, <q>If any one shall say, that
because the Holy Ghost appeared in the shape of a
Dove, and the Father in the old Testament under
the Corporal forms, that therefore they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by images, we must say to this, that those
corporal forms were not assumed by the Father and


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64671:263"/>
the Holy Spirit; and therefore a representation of
them by images is not a representation of the Divine
person, but a representation of that form or shape
alone. Therefore there is no reverence due to it, as
there is none due to those forms by themselves. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were these forms to represent the Divine persons,
but to represent those effects which those Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
did effect.]</q> And therefore there is one thing
more to be said to them that do so;<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>They have chang'd

why, but the Doctor thinks that in the world
there cannot be clearer words for the reproof of pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
God and the Holy Trinity. For <hi>to do so is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and extreme impiety,</hi> so says <hi>Damascen:</hi> But stay
says E. W.<note place="margin">E. W. pag. 60.</note> these words of <hi>Damascen</hi> are <hi>[as who should
say, He that goes about to express by any image the perfect
similitude of Gods intrinsecal perfections or his Nature,</hi>
(which is immense without body or figure) <hi>would be
both impious, and act the part of a Mad-man.]</hi> But
how shall any man know that these words of <hi>Damascen</hi>
are <hi>as much as to say</hi> this meaning of E. W. and where
is this principle (as he calls it) of <hi>Damascen,</hi> by which
the Doctor is so every where silenc'd? Certainly E.
W. is a merry Gentleman, and thinks all mankind are
fools. This is the ridiculous Commentary of E. W.

when God forbad the children of <hi>Israel</hi> to make any
likeness of him,<note place="margin">Synod. 11. Act. 5.</note> did he only forbid them to express by
any image the perfect similitude of his intrinsecal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections?
Had the children of <hi>Israel</hi> leave to picture
God in the form of a man walking in <hi>Paradise?</hi> Or to
paint the Holy Trinity like three men talking to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi>
Was it lawful for them to make an image or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
or (to use E. W. his expression) <hi>to exhibit to
their eyes those visible or circumscribed lineaments,</hi> which
any man had seen? And when they had exhibited these
forms to the eyes, might they then have fallen down
and worshipped those forms, which themselves exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their own and others eyes? I omit to enquire
how they can prove that God appear'd in <hi>Paradise</hi> in
the form of a man, which they can never do, unless
they will use the Friers argument; <hi>Faciamus hominem
ad similitudinem nostram,</hi> &amp;c. and so make fair way for
the Heresie of the <hi>Anthropomorphites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I pass on a little further; Did the <hi>Israelites,</hi>


                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:64671:264"/>
when they made a molten calf, and said, <hi>These are thy
Gods O Israel,</hi> did they imagine that by that image
they represented the true form, essence or nature of
God? Or did the Heathens ever pretend to make any
image of the intrinsecal perfections of any of their
<hi>Majores</hi> or <hi>Minores Dii,</hi> or any of their <hi>Daemons</hi> and
dead <hi>Heroes?</hi> And because they neither did nor could
do that, may it therefore be concluded, that they
made no images of their Gods? Certain it is, the
Heathens have as much reason to say they did not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
their Gods, meaning their nature and essence,
but by symbolical forms and shapes represented those
good things which they suppos'd them to have done.
Thus the <hi>Egyptians</hi> pictur'd <hi>Joseph</hi> with a Bushel upon
his head, and called him their God <hi>Serapis;</hi> but they
made no image of his essence, but symbolically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the benefit he did the nation by preserving them
in the seven years famine. Thus <hi>Ceres</hi> is painted with
a Hook and a Sheaf of corn, <hi>Pomona</hi> with a Basket of
Apples, <hi>Hercules</hi> with a Club, and <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself with
a handful of symbolical Thunderbolts; This is that
which the Popish Doctors call picturing God, not in
his <hi>Essence,</hi> but in <hi>history,</hi> or in <hi>symbolical shapes:</hi> For
of these three ways of picturing God, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> says,
the two last are lawful. And therefore the Heathens
not doing the first, but the second, and the third only,
are just so to be excused as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is.
But then neither these nor those must pretend that
they do not picture God: For whatever the intention

<hi>Bellarmines</hi> distinction is very foolish, and is only craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64671:265"/>
to deceive; for besides the impertinency of it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
the charge, only by declaring his intention,
as being charged with picturing God; he tells he did
it indeed, but he meant not to paint his nature, but
his story or his symbolical significations, which I say
is impertinent, it not being inquir'd with what purpose
it is done, but whether or no; and an evil thing may
be done with a good intention: Besides this I say, that
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> distinction comes just to this issue: God
may be painted or represented by an image, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a perfect similitude of his form or nature, but to
express it imperfectly, or rather not to express it,
but <hi>ad explicandam naturam,</hi> to explain it, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
him truly, but historically; though that be a
strange history, that does not express truly and as it
is: But here it is plainly acknowledged, that besides
the history, <hi>the very Nature of God may be explicated by
pictures</hi> or images, provided they be only metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and mystical, as if the only reason of the lawfulness
of painting God is, because it is done imperfectly and
unlike him; or as if the metaphor made the image law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
just as if to do <hi>Alexander</hi> honour, you should pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
him like a <hi>Bear,</hi> tearing and trampling every
thing, or to exalt <hi>Caesar,</hi> you should hang upon a table
the pictures of a <hi>Fox</hi> and a <hi>Cock</hi> and a <hi>Lion,</hi> and write
under it, This is <hi>Cajus Julius Caesar.</hi> But I am asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of these prodigious follies. But at last, why
should it be esteemed madness and impiety to picture
the nature of God, which is invisible, and not also be
as great a madness to picture any shape of him, which
no man ever saw? But he that is invested with a thick
cloud, and encircled with an inaccessible glory, and
never drew aside the Curtains to be seen under any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentment,
will not suffer himself to be expos'd to
vulgar eyes, by phantastical shapes, and ridiculous
forms.</p>

But it may be, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not use any
such impious practice, much less own so mad a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
for one of my adversaries says, that <hi>the pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the forms or appearances of God is all that some</hi> (in
their Church) <hi>allow,</hi> that is, some do, and some do
not: So that it may be only a private opinion of some

with it.<note place="margin">Lib 2. de reliq. &amp; imagin. S.</note> To this I answer, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed

To some of these purposes the Dissuasive alledged
<hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Eusebius</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom;</hi> but <hi>A.</hi> L. says,
these Fathers have nothing to this purpose. This is
now to be tried. These men were only nam'd in the
Dissuasive. Their words are these which follow.</p>
                  <p>1. For <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De coronâ mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit.</note> A man would think it could not
be necessary to prove that <hi>Tertullian</hi> thought it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to picture God the Father, when he thought the
whole art of painting and making images to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as I have already proved. But however let us see.
He is very curious that nothing should be us'd by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
or in the service of God, which is us'd on, or by,
or towards idols; and because they did paint and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
their idols, cast, or carve them, therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that kind ought to be <hi>in rebus Dei,</hi> as <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s
phrase is. But the summ of his discourse is this,
<q>[The Heathens use to picture
their false Gods that indeed befits
them,<note place="margin">De Cor. Milit. Johannes Filioli inquit, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodite vos ab idolis, non jam ab idolola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria quasi ab officio, sed ab idolis, id est, ab ipsâ effigie eorum: Indignum enim est ut imago Divini, imagoidoli &amp; mortui fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: Si enim verbo nudo conditio polluitur ut Apostolus docet, si quis dixerit idolothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est, non contigeris, multo magis cum habitu, &amp; ritu, &amp; apparatu, &amp;c. Quid enim tam dignum Deo quàm quod indignum idolo?</note> but therefore is unfit for
God; and therefore we are to flee,
not only from idolatry, but from
idols: in which affair a word does
change the case, and that, which
before it was said to appertain to
idols, was lawful, by that very
word was made Unlawful, and
therefore much more by a shape or figure; and
therefore flee from the shape of them; for it is an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
thing, that the image of the living God,
should be made the image of an idol or a dead thing.
For the idols of the Heathens are silver and gold, and
have eyes without sight, and noses without smell,
and hands without feeling.]</q> So far <hi>Tertullian</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues.
And what can more plainly give his sense and
meaning in this Article? If the very image of an idol
be Unlawful, much more is it unlawful to make an


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64671:266"/>
image or idol of the living God, or represent him by
the image of a dead man.</p>
                  <p>But this argument is further and more plainly set
down by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> whose book against the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
is spent in reproving the images of God real or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
insomuch that he affirms that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
even their false Gods, by making images of
them, and that they might better have pass'd for Gods,
if they had not represented them by visible images.
And therefore, <hi>that the religion of
making images of their Gods,</hi>

                     <hi>is not
piety, but impious. For to know
God we need no outward thing; the
way of truth will direct us to him.
And if any man ask which is that way,</hi>
viz. <hi>to know God, I shall say, it is
the soul of a man, and that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which is planted in us; for
by that alone God can be seen and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.]</hi>
The same Father does
discourse many excellent things to
this purpose, as that a man is the
only image of God; Jesus Christ
is the perfect image of his Glory, and he only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
his essence; and man is made in the likeness of
God, and therefore he also in a less perfect manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
God: Besides these, if any man desires to see
God, let him look in the book of the creature, and all
the world is the image and lively representment of
Gods power, and his wisdom, his goodness and his
bounty. But to represent God in a carved stone, or a
painted Table, does depauperate our understanding of
God, and dishonours him below the Painters art; for
it represents him lovely only by that art, and therefore
less than him that painted it. But that which <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
adds is very material, and gives great reason of the


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64671:267"/>
Command, why God should severely forbid any image
of himself: <hi>Calamitati enim &amp; tryannidi servientes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
Unicum illud est nulli Communicabile Dei nomen lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
lapidibusque imposuerunt:</hi> Some in sorrow for their
dead children, made their images and fancied that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
some desiring to please their tyrannous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
put up their statues, and at distance by a phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
presence flattered them with honours. And in
process of time, these were made Gods; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable
name was given to wood and stones.]
Not that the Heathens thought that image to be very
God, but that they were imaginarily present in them,
and so had their Name. <hi>Hujusmodi igitur initiis idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
inventio Scriptura teste apud homines coepit.</hi> Thus
idolatry began saith the Scripture, and thus it was
promoted; and the event was, they made pitiful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of God, they confined his presence to a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
they worshipped him with the lowest way imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
they descended from all spirituality and the
noble ways of Understanding, and made wood and
stone to be as it were a body to the Father of Spirits,
they gave the incommunicable name not only to dead
men, and Angels, and Daemons, but to the images of
them; and though it is great folly to picture Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Spirits, and dead Heroes, whom they never saw,
yet by these steps when they had come to picture God
himself, this was the height of the <hi>Gentile</hi> impiety,
and is but too plain a representation of the impiety
practised by too many in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>But as we proceed further, the case will be yet clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Concerning the testimony of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> I wonder
that any writer of <hi>Roman</hi> controversies should be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and being so, should confidently say, <hi>Eusebius</hi>
hath nothing to this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to condemn the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing
of God,<note place="margin">Synod. 7. act. 6.</note> when his words are so famous, that
they are recorded in the seventh Synod; and the words


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64671:267"/>
were occasioned by a solemn message sent to <hi>Eusebius</hi>
by the sister of <hi>Constantius</hi> and wife of <hi>Licinius,</hi> lately
turned from being Pagan to be Christian, desiring <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> to send her the picture of our Lord Jesus; to
which he answers: <hi>Quia vero de quadam imagine, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si
Christi, scripsisti, hanc volens tibi à nobis mitti, quam
dicis, &amp; qualèm, hanc quam perhibes Christi imaginem?
Utrum veram &amp; incommutabilem, &amp; natura characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
suos portantem? An istam quam propter nos suscepit
servi formae schemate circumamictus? Sed de forma qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
Dei nec ipse arbitror te quaerere semel ab ipso edoctam,
quoniam neque patrem quis novit nisi filius, neque ipsum
filium novit quis aliquando digne, nisi solus pater qui eum
genuit.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Quis ergo hujusmodi digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
&amp; gloriae vibrantes, &amp; praefulgentes splendores exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
potuisset mortuis &amp; inanimatis Coloribus &amp; scripturis
Umbraticis?</hi> And then speaking of the glory of Christ
in Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> he proceeds; <hi>Ergo si tunc incarnata
ejus forma tantam virtutem sortita est ab inhabitante in se
Divinitate mutata, quid oportet dicere cum mortalitate
exutus, &amp; corruptione ablutus, speciem servilis formae
in gloriam Domini &amp; Dei commutavit?</hi> Where besides
that <hi>Eusebius</hi> thinks it unlawful to make a picture of
Christ, and therefore consequently, much more to
make a picture of God; he also tells <hi>Constantia,</hi> he
supposes she did not offer at any desire of that.]
Well, for these three of the Fathers we are well
enough, but for the rest, the objector says, that they
<hi>speak only against representing God as in his own essence,
shape or form.</hi> To this I answer, that God hath no
shape or form, and therefore these Fathers could not
speak against making images of a thing that was not;
and as for the images of his essence, no Christian, no
Heathen ever pretended to it; and no man or beast can
be pictured so: No Painter can paint an Essence.
And therefore although this distinction was lately


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64671:268"/>
made in the <hi>Roman</hi> Schools, yet the Fathers knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors can make nothing
of it, for the reasons now told. But the Gentleman
saith, that some of their Church allow only and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the picturing those forms, wherein God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
It is very well they do no more; but I pray
in what forms did God the Father ever appear, or the
Holy and Mysterious Trinity? Or suppose they had,
does it follow they may be painted? We saw but now
out of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> that it was not esteemed lawful to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
Christ, though he did appear in a humane body:
And although it is supposed that the Holy Ghost did
appear in the shape of a Dove,<note place="margin">Concil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> 82.</note> yet it is forbidden by
the sixth General Council to paint Christ like a Lamb,
or the Holy Spirit like a Dove. Add to this, where
did ever the Holy and Blessed Trinity appear like three
faces joyned in one, or like an old man with Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
leaning on his breast, and a Dove hovering
over them; and yet however the objector is pleas'd to
mince the matter, yet the doing this is <hi>ubique inter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicos
recepta;</hi> and that not only to be seen, but to
be ador'd, as I prov'd a little above by testimonies of
their own.</p>
                  <p>The next charge is concerning S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that he
says no such thing; which matter will soon be at an
end, if we see the Commentary he makes on these
words of <hi>Isaiah; Cui ergo similem

thought so too at first; but because the objector says

of God, but not his forms and appearances; a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which those good old writers never thought of,
but directly they condemned all images of God and the
Holy Trinity. And the Bishops in the seventh Synod,
though they were worshippers of images, yet they
thinking that Angels were Corporeal, believ'd they
might be painted, but denied it of God expresly. And
indeed it were a strange thing that God in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
should so severely forbid any image to be made
of him, upon this reason because he is invisible; and
he presses it passionately by calling it to their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that they heard a voice, but saw no shape; and
yet that both he had formerly and did afterwards shew
himself, in shapes and forms which might be painted,
and so the very reason of the Commandment be wholly
void. To which add this consideration, that although
the Angels did frequently appear, and consequently
had forms possible to be represented in imagery, yet
none of the Ancients did suppose it lawful to paint


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64671:269"/>
Angels, but they that thought them to be corporeal.

God is not seen with eyes, he is like to no man;
therefore no man can by an image know him. By
which it appears plainly to be the General opinion of
the Ancients, that whatever was incorporeal was not
to be painted, no, though it had appeared in symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Let them translate it that please, only I remember that
<hi>Aventinus</hi> tells a story,<note place="margin">Annal. Biorum. l. 7.</note> that Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII. caused
to be burnt for Heretics, those persons who had paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Holy Trinity, which I urge for no other reason,
but to shew how late an innovation of religion this is
in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The worship of images came
in by decrees, and it was long resisted, but until of
late, it never came to the height of impiety as to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
God, and to worship him by images: But this
was the state and last perfection of this sin, and hath
spoiled a great part of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and turn'd it back
to <hi>Ethnicism.</hi>

                     <hi>Gregory</hi> II. to the Question, <hi>Cur tamen Patrem
Domini nostri Jesu Christi non oculis subjicimus?</hi> Why do
we not subject the Father of our Lord Jesus to the eyes?
He answers, <hi>Quoniam Dei natura spectanda proponi non
potest ac fingi:</hi> The nature of God cannot be expos'd to
be beheld, nor yet fain'd.] He did not conclude that
therefore we cannot make the image of his essence, but
none at all, nothing of him to be expos'd to the sight.
And that this is his direct and full meaning, besides
his own words, we may conclude from the note which
<hi>Baronius</hi> makes upon it. <hi>Postea in usu venisse ut pinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
in Ecclesia Pater &amp; Spiritus Sanctus.</hi> Afterwards it
became an use in the Church <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman)</hi> to
paint the Father and the Holy Ghost. And therefore
besides the impiety of it, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty
of innovation in this particular also, which was the
thing I intended to prove.</p>
