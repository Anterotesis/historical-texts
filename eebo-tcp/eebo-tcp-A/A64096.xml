         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE great Variety of weighty and important Affairs, in which your Lordſhip is engaged; one would think, did ſo entirely engroſs your Time, that you could not have a Minute left to beſtow on the Muſes. Your unwearied and ſuccesful Application to
<pb facs="tcp:62473:4"/>
the Buſineſs of the State, in the niceſt Conjunctions, that perhaps <hi>England</hi> ever ſaw; as well as your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Labours in diſtributing Juſtice, in your High Station; have been attended with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Applauſe; and have convinced all the World, how much the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Majeſty's Government, and the Happineſs of his People, depend on the Capacity and Integrity of his Miniſters. You have not ſuffered, even neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments to interrupt your Conſtant Cares for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. To ſerve your Country, you have defranded your ſelf both of Meat, and Rest; which, my Lord, is the only Act of Injuſtice, that was ever charged upon you. Your immoderate Labours make daily Encroachments upon your Health; or at leaſt 'tis the fear of every good Man, that they ſhould. And yet your Lordſhip, notwithſtanding all Diſſwaſions, perſeveres inflexible; as if, animated by the Noble Spirit of an Old Roman, you were reſolved to Sacrifice your Life, for the Good of your Country.</p>
                  <p>And yet, my Lord, amidſt ſuch a multiplicity of the greatest Affairs, to which you pay a conſtant Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; you have not only found Time, to apply your Thoughts to all kinds of Literature, ſo as to become a great Maſter in all; But you have likewiſe extended your Care to the Intereſts of Learning, and to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of thoſe, who ſtudy the Advancement of it. Among many other Inſtances, your Lordſhip has lately condeſcended, to Preſide over the <hi>Royal Society</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:62473:4"/>
that was inſtituted, for the Improvement of Natural Experimental Philoſophy; and you have taken care, to Expreſs your great Zeal and Readineſs, to contribute every thing in your Power, to Protect their Intereſts, and Promote their Reputation. And under your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's enlivening Influence, there is all the Reaſon in the World to expect, that Learning will again flouriſh there, as well as among other Orders of Men.</p>
                  <p>This, my Lord, has ſo embolden'd me, humbly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this Performance to your Lordſhip. For ſince ſo Great a Patron of Letters is riſen in the midſt of us; we think we have a ſort of Right to his Countenance and Protection. I wiſh the Preſent I preſume to make you, was more worthy of your Lordſhip: All that I can ſay to recommend it, is, that the Subject is Novel, and that Care has been taken to give it a juſt Deſcription; which, I may ſay, without vanity, never yet appeared in Publick.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a true Remark, which we cannot make without Admiration; That from Minerals, to Plants; from Plants, to Animals; and from Animals, to Men; the Tranſition is ſo gradual, that there appears a very great Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as well between the meaneſt Plant, and ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; as between the loweſt Rank of Men, and the higheſt kind of Animals. The Animal of which I have given the Anatomy, coming neareſt to Mankind; ſeems the Nexus of the Animal and Rational, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and thoſe of your High Rank and Order for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:62473:5"/>
and Wiſdom, approaching neareſt to that kind of Beings which is next above us; Connect the Viſible, and Inviſible World.</p>
                  <p>If this Performance ſhall Promote the Deſign of the Society, of which I have the Honour to be a Member, and which your Lordſhip is pleaſed to Preſide over; by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Natural Hiſtory of Animals, and affording the Reader any Delightful and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Inſtructions; I ſhall look on my Time and Pains, well rewarded.

                  <head>THE PREFACE</head>
                  <p>LEAST this Diſcourſe ſhould be rejected meerly for the Title's ſake, as if 'twere intended only to divert the Reader, with the Recital of the Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Romantick Stories, which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on the Subjects I have propoſed to treat of: I think it neceſſary to premiſe, that as my chief Deſign in this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking is the Improvement of the <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> ſo I have made it my Buſineſs more, to find out the <hi>Truth,</hi> than to enlarge in the <hi>Mythology</hi>; to inform the <hi>Judgment,</hi> than to pleaſe the <hi>Phancy,</hi> And the <hi>Orang-Outang</hi> (whoſe <hi>Anatomy</hi> I here give) being a Creature ſo very remarkable, and rare; and not only in its External Shape, but much more in the Conformation of a great many of the inward <hi>Viſcera,</hi> ſo much reſembling a Man; I thought I could not be too particular, in my Deſcription of it; though to ſome, who have not a Taſt of theſe Matters, I may ſeem prolix and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
                  <p>To render this <hi>Diſquiſition</hi> more uſeful, I have made a <hi>Comparative</hi> Survey of this <hi>Animal,</hi> with a <hi>Monkey,</hi> an <hi>Ape,</hi> and a <hi>Man.</hi> By viewing the ſame Parts of all thoſe together, we may the better obſerve <hi>Nature's Gradation</hi> in the Formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Animal</hi> Bodies, and the Tranſitions made from one to another; than which, nothing can more conduce to the
<pb facs="tcp:62473:6"/>
Attainment of the true Knowledge, both of the <hi>Fabrick</hi> and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes of the Parts. By following <hi>Nature's</hi> Clew in this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> we may be more eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into her <hi>Secret Receſſes,</hi> which Thread if we miſs, we muſt needs err and be bewilder'd.</p>
                  <p>In drawing up this <hi>Compariſon,</hi> I have made uſe of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> which is given of <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi> by other Authors; and very frequently have quoted their own words, which has render'd my Diſcourſe much longer: For not having theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals</hi> by me to diſſect and compare, I thought it but juſt to let the <hi>Reader</hi> ſee, upon what Authorities I went. And though a ſhort Reference might be eſteemed ſufficient, without this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and unfaſhionable way of inſerting the whole <hi>Text</hi>; yet if any one will give himſelf the trouble of Examining the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences I have produced, I think I have dealt more kindly by him, in making him a Judge himſelf; than in leaving him bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to truſt to my Report. For there are none, who have been converſant with Books, but muſt acknowledge, that they have been often impoſed upon, for want of this fair dealing, as I have my ſelf Experienced in this preſent Enquiry. To avoid therefore this Error, my Caution it may be has lead me into another, which I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will pardon, if he judges it ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> formerly diſſected <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys,</hi> and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Scholars the frequent <hi>Anatomizing</hi> them, as uſeful for the attaining the Knowledge of the Structure of the Parts in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Bodies. Had he met with our <hi>Animal,</hi> it had ſerved his turn much better: Nor had he been liable to ſome Miſtakes, which <hi>Veſalius</hi> charges him with, ſince in ſo many Parts, the <hi>Orang-Outang</hi> imitates a <hi>Man,</hi> more than <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi> do. Not only <hi>Galen,</hi> but the greateſt <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> we have had in this laſt Age, have exerciſed their Pens about them; as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears in the enſuing Diſcourſe, which ſufficiently juſtifies me for engaging in this Argument: I wiſh I had ſo good an Apology for my Performance.</p>

                  <p>But ſo many <hi>Romances</hi> have been made about them, that not only <hi>Strabo</hi> formerly, but the moſt noted Men of Learning of late, have looked upon them as meer Fictions of the <hi>Poets,</hi> and have utterly denied them any real Being. <hi>Homer's Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachia</hi> therefore, or <hi>Fight</hi> of the <hi>Cranes</hi> and <hi>Pygmies</hi> I have rendered a probable Story. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s aſſertion of the being of <hi>Pygmies,</hi> I have vindicated from the falſe Gloſſes of others. The Conjectures of other Learned Men about them, I have examined: And by what I have ſaid in the following <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Eſſay,</hi> I think I have fully proved, that there were ſuch <hi>Animals</hi> as the Ancients called <hi>Pygmies, Cynocephali, Satyrs,</hi> and <hi>Sphinges</hi>; and that they were only <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys.</hi>

                  <p>THAT the <hi>Pygmies</hi> of the Antients were a ſort of <hi>Apes,</hi> and not of <hi>Humane Race,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to prove in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Eſſay.</hi> And if the <hi>Pygmies</hi> were only <hi>Apes,</hi> then in all probability our <hi>Ape</hi> may be a <hi>Pygmies</hi>; a ſort of <hi>Animal</hi> ſo much reſembling <hi>Man,</hi> that both the Antients and the Moderns have reputed it to be a <hi>Puny Race</hi> of Mankind, call'd to this day, <hi>Homo Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtris,</hi> The <hi>Wild Man; Orang-Outang,</hi> or a <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Woods</hi>; by the <hi>Africans Quoias Morron</hi>; by others <hi>Baris,</hi> or <hi>Barris,</hi> and by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugeſe,</hi> the <hi>Salvage.</hi> But obſerving that under theſe Names, they deſcribe different <hi>Animals</hi>; for Diſtinction-ſake, and to avoid Equivocation, I ſhall call the Subject, of which I am about to give the <hi>Anatomy,</hi> a <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from its Stature; which I find to be juſt the ſame with the Stature of the <hi>Pygmies</hi> of the Antients. <hi>Tulpius</hi> 'tis true, and <hi>Bontius,</hi> and <hi>Dapper</hi> do call it, <hi>Satyrus.</hi> And tho' I am of Opinion, that the <hi>Satyrs</hi> of the Antients were of the <hi>Ape,</hi> or rather <hi>Monkey</hi>-kind; yet for the Reaſons alledged in the following <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I cannot think our <hi>Animal</hi> a <hi>Satyr.</hi> The <hi>Baris</hi> or <hi>Barris,</hi> which they deſcribe to be much taller than our <hi>Animal,</hi> probably may be what we call a <hi>Drill.</hi> But I muſt confeſs, there is ſo great Confuſion in the Deſcription of this ſort of Creature, which I find is a very large Family (there being numerous <hi>Species</hi> of them) that in Tranſcribing the Authors that have wrote about them, 'tis almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but to make miſtakes; from the want of their well diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. I ſhall endeavour therefore in my Account of this, ſo to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62473:8"/>
diſcriminate it, that it may be eaſily known again, where-ever 'tis met with. Not that I think in a ſingle Obſervation I can be ſo exact, but that I may be liable to make Errors my ſelf, how careful ſoever I have been.</p>
                  <p>I will not urge any thing more here, why I call it a <hi>Pygmie</hi>: 'Tis neceſſary to give it a Name; and if what I offer in the enſuing <hi>Eſſay,</hi> does not ſufficiently Account for the <hi>Denomination,</hi> I leave it to others to give it one more proper. What I ſhall moſt of all aim at in the following Diſcourſe, will be to give as particular an Account as I can, of the formation and ſtructure of all the Parts of this wonderful <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>; and to make a <hi>Comparative</hi> Survey of them, with the ſame Parts in a <hi>Humane Body,</hi> as likewiſe in the <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey</hi>-kind. For tho' I own it to be of the <hi>Ape</hi> kind, yet, as we ſhall obſerve, in the <hi>Organization</hi> of abundance of its Parts, it more approaches to the Structure of the ſame in <hi>Men</hi>: But where it differs from a <hi>Man,</hi> there it reſembles plainly the Common <hi>Ape,</hi> more than any other <hi>Animal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho' I may ſeem too tedious in diſcourſing ſo long upon a ſingle ſubject, yet I have this to offer, that if we had an accurate and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of any <hi>one Species</hi> of <hi>Animal,</hi> it might in a great meaſure ſerve for the <hi>whole kind.</hi> Wherein they differ, might eaſily be taken notice of, and there would be no need of repeating any thing, wherein they all agreed. So formerly diſſecting a Young <hi>Lion</hi> and a <hi>Cat</hi> at the ſame time, I wondred to find ſo very great Reſemblance of all the Parts, both in the one and the other; that the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the one might ſerve for the other, allowing for the Magnitude of the Parts, with very little other alteration: And not only for this, but for ſeveral other <hi>Animals,</hi> that belong to the ſame Family. I could have wiſhed I had had the like Opportunity, when I was diſſecting our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> of comparing the ſame Parts with thoſe of an <hi>Ape</hi> and a <hi>Monkey</hi>: For want of it, I have referred all along to the Accounts given us of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of theſe Creatures by other Authors; which, tho' it renders my Diſcourſe more prolix, yet I thought it would not be unacceptable to the Curious. But I ſhall take care to draw up in a ſhorter view, wherein our <hi>Pygmie</hi> more reſembled a <hi>Man,</hi> than an <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey,</hi> and wherein it differ'd.</p>
                  <p>Now notwithſtanding our <hi>Pygmie</hi> does ſo much reſemble a <hi>Man</hi> in many of its Parts, more than any of the <hi>Ape-kind,</hi> or any other <hi>Animal</hi> in the World that I know of: Yet by no means do I look upon it as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a <hi>mixt</hi> Generation; 'tis a <hi>Brute-Animal ſui generis,</hi> and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Ape.</hi> For when I was diſſecting it, ſome Sea-Captains and Merchants who came to my Houſe to ſee it, aſſured me, that they had ſeen a great many of them in <hi>Borneo, Sumatra,</hi> and other Parts, tho' this was brought from <hi>Angola</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi>; but was firſt taken a great deal higher up in the Country, and in Company with it there was a <hi>Female</hi> of the ſame kind.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall have, hereafter occaſion to make my Remarks on ſeveral Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, relating to it's way of Living, it's Sagacity, Actions, and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62473:8"/>
like. I ſhall now therefore firſt of all deſcribe its <hi>outward</hi> ſhape and figure; then look within, and obſerve the <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> there. But meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> wherein he gives a general Deſcription of the <hi>Ape-kind,</hi> I think it not amiſs to Tranſcribe it; and by Commenting upon it, to ſhew wherein our preſent Subject agrees with or differs from it; and what I have beſides to Remark, I ſhall afterwards take notice of, and then proceed to the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Inward</hi> Parts.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> (as I have remark'd) renders this Paſſage thus: <hi>Pedibus paulum differunt, ſunt enim, ut manus, praelongi; ſed veſtigium Palmae ſimile fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt.</hi> Now the <hi>Palms</hi> of the <hi>Hands,</hi> and the <hi>Soles</hi> of the <hi>Feet</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> were equally long, and longer, proportionably, than in <hi>Man</hi>; and herein it reſembled more the <hi>Ape</hi>-kind: As it did likewiſe in the length of the <hi>Toes,</hi> which were as long as the <hi>Fingers,</hi> as alſo in having the middlemoſt <hi>Toe</hi> longer than the reſt. For in the <hi>Hand</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> the middle Finger is the longeſt, but in the <hi>Foot,</hi> the middle Toe is not. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> does very well liken it to a Hand, ſince beſides the length of the <hi>Toes,</hi> like <hi>Fingers,</hi> it had the <hi>great Toe,</hi> like the <hi>Thumb</hi> ſet off at a diſtance from the range of the other Toes, as we ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>(l) <hi>Ariſt.</hi> The ſole of the Foot in the hinder part was more callous, ill, and odly imitating a Heel: For they uſe their Feet in both Capacities, both as a Hand and Foot, and bend them like Hands.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Ape</hi>-kind there is a true <hi>Os Calcis,</hi> beſides this <hi>Calloſity.</hi> And in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> this <hi>Heel-bone</hi> was liker that in a Man, than theirs is. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> in the former <hi>Paragraph</hi> ſhewed what reſemblance this Part had to a <hi>Humane Hand,</hi> in this, by reaſon of the <hi>Os Calcis,</hi> how 'tis like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62473:13"/>
a <hi>Foot</hi>; and then makes an Inference from the different ſtructure of this <hi>Organ,</hi> that it performs the Uſes and Offices of both.</p>
                  <p>All which is very agreeable to our <hi>Pygmie.</hi> But this <hi>Part,</hi> in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and it's Function too, being liker a <hi>Hand,</hi> than a <hi>Foot</hi>; for the diſtinguiſhing this ſort of <hi>Animals</hi> from others, I have thought, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it might not be reckoned and call'd rather <hi>Quadru-manus</hi> than <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupes,</hi> i. e. a <hi>four-handed,</hi> than a <hi>four-footed Animal.</hi>
                  </p>

So that this <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> hath the Advantage of making uſe of their <hi>Feet</hi> as <hi>Hands,</hi> and their <hi>Hands</hi> as <hi>Feet,</hi> as there is occaſion.</p>

                  <p>(o) <hi>Ariſt.</hi> They have the upper Parts much larger than the lower, as being Quadrupeds, almoſt as five to three; and as upon this account, ſo be becauſe they have Feet like Hands, as if they were compounded of a Hand and Foot: Of a Foot, in reſpect of the Heel behind; and of a Hand, as to the other Parts; for they have Fingers, and what we call the Palm.</p>
                  <p>In Quadrupeds uſually the <hi>

But ſince <hi>Nature</hi> deſign'd it not always to live on the Ground, but to get it's Prey in the Trees likewiſe, it hath very wiſely formed this Part like a Hand, by which means it can more eaſily climb them; and when there, ſhift much better by this Contrivance; as I have ſhewn in my Diſcourſe <note n="(27)" place="bottom">Philoſoph.

But whether 'tis ſo in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> I do ſuſpect; ſince walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it's Knuckles, as our <hi>Pygmie</hi> did, ſeems no Natural Poſture; and 'tis ſufficiently provided in all reſpects to walk erect.</p>

and a quarter. The length of the Arm, from the Shoulder to the end of the Fingers, Seventeen Inches. The Girth of the Shoulder about the middle, Four Inches and a quarter; of the Arm near the Elbow, Five Inches. The Hand from the Wriſt to the end of the Middle Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, meaſured Five Inches and an half. The Thumb was an Inch and a quarter long; the Fore-Finger Two Inches, the Middle-Finger Two Inches and an half; the Ring-Finger Two Inches and a quarter, and the Little Finger One Inch and an half long. The Girth of the Thumb and the Little Finger, was One Inch; the Girth of the other Fingers was an Inch and a quarter. The Palm of the Hand was Three Inches long, and an Inch and three quarters broad.</p>
                  <p>From the head of the Thigh-Bone to the Heel, it meaſured Twelve Inches: From the Heel to the end of the Middle-Toe (which was the longeſt) Five Inches three quarters. The Girth of the Thigh was Six Inches; of the Leg at the Calf, Four Inches and a quarter; of the Foot at the ſetting on of the Great Toe, near Five Inches. The Great Toe was an Inch and half long, the Fore-Toe One Inch, the Middle-Toe an Inch and half, the Third Toe an Inch and a quarter, the Little Toe One Inch long. The Sole of the Foot, about the ſetting on of the Great Toe (where 'twas broadeſt) was Two Inches over; but nearer the Heel, 'twas an Inch and half broad. The Girth of the Great Toe, where biggeſt, an Inch and half, the other Toes were an Inch about. Theſe Meaſures were taken before the Skin was ſtrip't off, in the <hi>Skeleton,</hi> or the Skin ſtuff'd, they may prove otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>And having now given theſe <hi>Dimenſions</hi> of the whole, and of moſt of the External Parts; you will the better conceive the exact ſhape of this wonderful <hi>Animal</hi> by the <hi>Figures</hi> I have cauſed to be made of it. As the <hi>Firſt Figure</hi> repreſents our <hi>Pygmie</hi> erect, where you have a <hi>view</hi> of all the <hi>Fore-Parts.</hi> Being weak, the better to ſupport him, I have given him a Stick in his Right-Hand. But our <hi>Figure</hi> being made after he was dead, the <hi>Head</hi> ſeems too much fallen in between the Shoulders, as if it had a very ſhore or little or no <hi>Neck,</hi> which takes off from the Beauty of the <hi>Figure</hi>; but this is rectified and mended in the Figure of the <hi>Skeleton,</hi> where you will ſee the <hi>Neck</hi> proportionate. The <hi>Head</hi> here is large and globous; the <hi>Ears</hi> ſtanding off, not lying cloſe. The <hi>face</hi> looks like an Old wither'd Man's, which without doubt was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd much more ſo, by an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> it had in one of it's <hi>Cheeks,</hi> occaſioned by a Fall it had on Ship-board upon a Cannon, which forced out one of it's Teeth; and the <hi>Jaw-bone</hi> afterwards proving carious, it might haſten it's Death. The riſing of the <hi>Cranium</hi> juſt under the <hi>Eye-lids,</hi> as I have ramark'd, is different from what is in a Man, and renders the <hi>Face</hi> harder; as does likewiſe it's flat Noſe, and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Jaw</hi> being more prominent, and leſſer ſpread, than in a <hi>Man</hi>; and it's <hi>Chin</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Jaw</hi> being ſhorter. The <hi>Eyes</hi> were a little ſunk, the <hi>Mouth</hi> large, the <hi>Teeth</hi> perfectly Humane. The <hi>Face</hi> was without Hair, and the Colour a little <hi>tawny</hi>; the <hi>Skin</hi> on the reſt of the Body was white.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62473:15"/>The <hi>Shoulders</hi> are ſpread and large, the <hi>Thorax</hi> or <hi>Breaſt</hi> extended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together like a <hi>Man's,</hi> the <hi>Mammae</hi> and <hi>Teats</hi> the ſame; the <hi>Belly</hi> was lank and pinch'd in, not prominent, by reaſon of it's illneſs; but here it held a more proportionable breadth to a <hi>Man</hi>'s, than a <hi>Quadruped's.</hi> The <hi>Arms</hi> were longer than in a <hi>Man,</hi> and ſo were the <hi>Palms</hi> of the Hands; but the <hi>Thumb</hi> was much leſs, the <hi>Nails</hi> exactly like a <hi>Man's,</hi> and the <hi>Navel</hi> the ſame. The <hi>Penis</hi> was different, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew. Here was no <hi>Scrotum,</hi> but the <hi>Teſtes</hi> were contained in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Pubis</hi> under the Skin, which made it here more protuberant. The <hi>Thighs</hi> and <hi>Legs</hi> were ſomewhat divaricated or ſtradling, for want of ſtrength, either from it's illneſs, or being but young. We obſerved <hi>Calves</hi> in it's Legs; the <hi>Feet</hi> long, as likewiſe the <hi>Toes,</hi> which were liker Fingers; and the <hi>Great Toe</hi> exactly like a <hi>Thumb,</hi> more than that on the <hi>Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second Figure</hi> repreſents the <hi>hinder Parts</hi> of this Creature, in an Erect Poſture likewiſe. Where may be obſerved, the Globous Figure and largeneſs of the <hi>Head,</hi> with the <hi>Ears</hi> ſtanding off; the curious ſnape and ſtraitneſs of the <hi>Back,</hi> and how it ſpreads. At the <hi>Os Coxygis</hi> there is a little Protuberance, but nothing like a <hi>Tail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Figure</hi> I have repreſented him with the <hi>Fingers</hi> of one Hand <hi>bended,</hi> as if kneeling upon his Knuckles, to ſhew the Action, when he goes on all four: For the Palms of his Hands never touch the Ground, but when he <hi>malks</hi> as a <hi>Quadruped,</hi> 'tis only upon his <hi>Knuckles.</hi> The other Hand is holding a Rope, to ſhew his Climbing; for he will nimbly run up the Tackle of a Ship, or climb a Tree: And having this hold, he is the better ſupported, to ſhew the <hi>Sole</hi> of the left Foot, and the <hi>Heel</hi> there; on account of which Heel it may be thought a <hi>Foot</hi>: But the <hi>Great Toe</hi> being ſet off ſo far from the range of the others, and they all being ſo large and long, it more reſembles a <hi>Hand,</hi> as has been obſerved.</p>
                  <p>If we compare <hi>our Figures</hi> with thoſe given by <hi>Tulpius, Bonlius,</hi> and <hi>Geſner,</hi> we ſhall find a great difference.

The <hi>Chaps</hi> or <hi>Roſtrum</hi> is longer, and 'tis leſs hairy in the fore-parts than ours.

                  <p>We will now examine <hi>Jacobus Bontius's Figure,</hi> and compare it with ours: And tho' he tells us, that he had ſeen ſome of both Sexes that went erect, eſpecially that <hi>Female one,</hi> whoſe <hi>Effigies</hi> he here gives us; yet I can't but think, he indulged more his Fancy herein, than copied the true Life; or at leaſt it was much different from ours. For ours had no ſuch long <hi>Hair</hi> on the Head, and all round the Face; the <hi>Face</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was not ſo flat and round, nor the <hi>Noſe</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Lip</hi> ſo riſing: The large <hi>Breaſts</hi> in his, anſwers the Deſcription which is given of it by others; ours being a <hi>Male,</hi> had but ſmall ones. But the <hi>Armes</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> (as'tis in the <hi>Ape</hi>-kind) were much longer than they are repreſented in his <hi>Figure,</hi> and the <hi>Feet</hi> are altogether different; for he makes them exactly like <hi>Humane Feet,</hi> and nothing like <hi>Hands,</hi> which is ſo Remarkable a thing in all theſe <hi>Animals,</hi> that this Miſtake of it ſelf, is enough to diſcountenance the Truth of his <hi>Picture,</hi> and render it ſuſpected. I ſhall not take notice, how ill the <hi>Hair</hi> is drawn, nor make any further Remarks upon the ſtructure of the <hi>Limbs,</hi> ſince I confeſs I do miſtruſt the whole <hi>Repreſentation.</hi> But becauſe he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, that this Creature had ſo much Modeſty, I have added to his <hi>Figure</hi> what becomes that Character.</p>
                  <p>That Figure in <hi>Conradus Geſner,</hi> 
                     <note n="(33)" place="bottom">Hiſt. de Quadruped. <hi>p.m.</hi> 859.</note> which he tells us he had out of a <hi>German</hi> Book, wrote about the Holy Land, in ſome Particulars I think more exact and juſt: For here he makes the <hi>Feet</hi> like <hi>Hands,</hi> the <hi>Legs</hi> more divaricated, the <hi>Face</hi> longer, and the <hi>Roſtrum</hi> more extended. But the <hi>Arms</hi> are too ſhort, and I do not know for what reaſon there is a <hi>Tail</hi> clap't on, which ſits untowardly enough, which muſt be ſurely an Addition of the <hi>Painter</hi>; or if there is any ſuch Creature in Nature, it muſt be of another Family, different from ours.</p>
                  <p>However, I have cauſed all theſe <hi>Figures</hi> to be copyed, that they may be the eaſier compared: But ſince they are ſo diſagreeing, as are likewiſe

the Deſcriptions they give of them, it ſufficiently juſtifies my Complaint of the uncertainty we have of the true <hi>Animal,</hi> that they are diſcourſing about; ſince the ſame Name probably may be given to different <hi>Species</hi> of the <hi>Ape</hi>-kind.

                  <p>But all this does not ſufficiently inform us of the particular ſhape, ſtructure, and make of the Body and the ſeveral Parts of this <hi>Animal,</hi> ſo as to be fully certain whether it be the ſame, or a different-Creature from the <hi>Ourang-Outang.</hi> And tho' I have mentioned it, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that probably the <hi>Baris</hi> might be, what we call a <hi>Drill,</hi> yet I own it as an uncertainty, ſince I have not met with what can juſtifie, or fully ſatisfie me herein.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pongo</hi> likewiſe which is deſcribed by <hi>Purchas,</hi> as a ſort of <hi>Wild Man,</hi> is different from our Subject; as it may be alſo from the reſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto mentioned. The Reaſon, therefore, why I inſert the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, as likewiſe of the others, I own to be, that hereby I might excite ſome <hi>Inquiſitive Obſervers</hi> to give us a truer Account of this large and noble <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi> 'Tis an Enquiry that would recompence their Curioſity with abundance of Satisfaction, by the many and uſeful Diſcoveries that they would make, and extreamly enrich the <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> whoſe enlargement, I think, in this <hi>Inquiſitive Age,</hi> hath not advanced ſo much as that of <hi>Botanie.</hi> For how great Diligence hath been uſed of late, to ranſack both the <hi>Indies,</hi> to pry into all the Corners of the World, both inhabited, and uninhabited, to find out a new <hi>Plant,</hi> not before deſcribed? And with what great Expence, and how magnificently are their <hi>Figures</hi> Printed? And how little hath been done in the Improvement of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi>? Not that I any ways diſlike the former, but the latter being a <hi>Nobler</hi> Subject, I can't but recommend it, as deſerving the Labours of the <hi>Curious</hi> likewiſe; and if any, this kind, I think, which comes ſo near to a Man, may be ſpeak the preference.</p>

His Face and Ears are without Hair and his Hands alſo. His Body is full of Hair, but not very thick, and it is of a dunniſh colour. He differeth not from a Man, but in his Legs, for he hath no Calf. He goeth always on his Legs, and carries his Hands claſped on the Nape of his Neck, when he goeth upon the Ground.

They ſleep in the Trees, and build ſhelters for the Rain. They feed upon Fruits that they find in the Woods, and upon Nuts; for they eat no kind of Fleſh. They cannot ſpeak, and have no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, no more than a Beaſt. The People of the Country, when they Travel in the Woods, make Fires, where they ſleep in the Night: And in the Morning when they are gone, the</hi> Pongoes <hi>will come and ſit about the Fire, till it goeth out; for they have no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding to lay the Wood together. They go many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and kill many</hi> Negroes <hi>that Travel in the Woods. Many times they fall upon Elephants, which come to feed where they be, and ſo beat them with their clubbed Fiſts, and pieces of Wood, that they will run away roaring from them. Theſe</hi> Pongoes <hi>are never taken alive, becauſe they are ſo ſtrong, that Ten Men cannot hold one of them: But yet they take many of their Young Ones with poiſoned Arrows. The Young</hi> Pongo <hi>hangeth on his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;s Belly, with his Hands faſt claſped about her; ſo that when any of the Country People kill any of the Females, they take the Young one which hangeth faſt upon his Mother.

His Skin is all hairy, his Eyes ſunk in his Head, a ſtern Countenance, tanned Face; but all his Lineaments are pretty propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, although harſh, and thickned by the Sun.

                  <p>Paſſing upon a time from <hi>China</hi> to the Coaſt of <hi>Coramandel,</hi> I did my ſelf ſee in the Straits of <hi>Molucca</hi> a kind of Ape, that might make pretty credible that which I just now related concerning the <hi>Savage Man.</hi>

                     <hi>The</hi> Omentum <hi>or</hi> Caul <hi>in our</hi> Pygmie <hi>was very thin and large, falling over and covering moſt parts of the Guts. 'Twas faſtened a Little to the</hi> Peritonaeum <hi>in the Left Side. It had but little</hi> Fat, <hi>and was tinged in many places with a deep Yellow Colour, by the Bladder of the</hi> Gall, <hi>as was likewiſe part of the</hi> Duodenum. <hi>It had numerous Blood-Veſſels, and it's adhaeſion to the</hi> Stomach, Colon, <hi>and other Parts, as in</hi> Man. <hi>The Remarks the</hi> Pariſians <hi>make upon the</hi> Epiploon <hi>or</hi> Omentum <hi>of the</hi> Monkeys <hi>they diſſected, were different from our Subject. For they tell us, That</hi> the <hi>Epiploon</hi> was different from that of a Man, in ſeveral things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was not faſtened to the <hi>Colon</hi> in ſo many places, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the left part of this Inteſtine. <hi>Ours I found was faſtened juſt as 'tis in Man. Secondly,</hi> It had another Ligature, which is not found in Man, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> by means of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which formed a Ligament; which we have obſerved in the <hi>Hind</hi> of <hi>Canada.

And in one</hi> Patient <hi>I found it fixt to the</hi> Peritonaeum <hi>in the</hi> Groin, <hi>which gave him a great deal of Pain and Trouble, eſpecially when his Bowels were any thing extended with Wind.

                  <p>This <hi>Gula</hi> or <hi>Gullet</hi> is a <hi>Hollow Muſcle,</hi> and fitly enough compared to a <hi>Funnel</hi>; where the <hi>Mouth,</hi> which may be thought a Part belonging to it, being more capacious, firſt receives the <hi>Food,</hi> and prepares it, by chewing, and then forces it down into this Stem or <hi>Pipe,</hi> to convey it to the <hi>Ventricle.</hi> I did not obſerve, upon the Diſſection, any difference of this Part in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from that of a <hi>Man.</hi> For as in a Man, (and ſo conformable too in other Circumſtances) it paſſed under the <hi>lower Muſcle</hi> of the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> which by that ſlant running of it's fleſhy Fibres over it, may perform to it the Office of a <hi>Valve,</hi> and prevent the Regurgitation of the Food that way. Which may be the more neceſſary in our Subject, becauſe being uſed to climb Trees, and in coming down, to be <hi>prono Capite,</hi> it might be the more liable to this Accident. But for the better preventing this, I find here, that the Paſſage of the <hi>Gula,</hi> a little above where it empties it ſelf into the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> was ſtraiter, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62473:22"/>
the inward Membrane here more rugous than in a Man; ſo that it ſeemed ſomewhat Analogous to a <hi>Valve. Drelincourt</hi> deſcribes it, in the <hi>Female Ape</hi> he diffected, thus. <hi>Orificium ejus ſuperius, nullâ Valvulâ clauſum; ſed interceptum duplici portione Diaphragmatis carnosâ, ab ejus tendinibus oriundâ.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Ventricle</hi> or <hi>Stomach,</hi> as we ſhall call this Part, in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> as to it's Situation and Figure, exactly repreſented a <hi>Humane Stomach.</hi> When inflated, from the entrance of the <hi>Gula</hi> along the upper part to the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> it meaſured Two Inches and three quarters. Meaſuring with a Thread from the <hi>Pylorus</hi> along under the <hi>Fundus,</hi> up again to the entrance of the <hi>Gula,</hi> I found it to be Fifteen Inches; in all, near Eighteen Inches. The length of the <hi>Stomach</hi> in a ſtrait Line, was Six Inches and an half; and it's breadth in a ſtrait Line, where broadeſt, near Four Inches. The Girth of the <hi>Stomach</hi> in the middle, was near Twelve Inches. So that I thought the <hi>Stomach</hi> large, in Proportion to the bulk of the Body. It had numerous <hi>Blood-Veſſels,</hi> ſpreading themſelves all over, as in a <hi>Man's</hi>; and I could plainly perceive the Inoſculations of large Trunks of the <hi>Coronary</hi> Branches, with thoſe that deſcended from the upper Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Pariſians <hi>obſerved in their</hi> Monkeys, That the Ventricle did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe differ from a Man's, it's inferiour Orifice being very large and low; for it was not elevated ſo high as the ſuperiour, as it is in a Man. <hi>I did not obſerve this in our</hi> Pygmie. <hi>So</hi> Drelincourt <hi>tells us in the</hi> Female Ape, Ventriculus rugis interiùs nullis gaudet; <hi>and ſome other Particulars he takes notice of. But there was nothing in ours, that I obſerved, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from a</hi> Man's.</p>
                  <p>As to their <hi>Food,</hi> I find it very different in the <hi>Ape-kind</hi>; as in part appears by what I have already mentioned of the <hi>Ourang Outang,</hi> the <hi>Baris,</hi> the <hi>Pongo,</hi> &amp;c. So that I can't but think, (like a Man) that they are <hi>omnivorous.</hi> What chiefly our <hi>Pygmie</hi> affected, when <hi>Wild,</hi> I was not informed of; after it was taken, and made tame, it would readily eat any thing that was brought to the Table; and very orderly bring it's Plate thither, to receive what they would give him. Once it was made Drunk with <hi>Punch,</hi> (and they are fond enough of ſtrong Liquors) But it was obſerved, that after that time, it would never drink above one Cup, and refuſed the offer of more than what he found agreed with him. Thus we ſee <hi>Inſtinct</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> teaches Brutes <hi>Temperance</hi>; and <hi>Intemperance</hi> is a Crime not only againſt the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Morality,</hi> but of <hi>Nature</hi> too.</p>

For the <hi>Pariſians</hi> tell us, that in their <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, the Inteſtines were almost all of the ſame bigneſs, and that the</hi> Ileon <hi>was in proportion a great deal bigger, than in a Man.</hi> In our Subject we found a ſenſible difference. For the <hi>ſmall Guts,</hi> which were much of a bigneſs, being a little extended, meaſured in Compaſs about Two Inches and three quarters. The <hi>Colon</hi> was Three Inches and three quarters about; and the <hi>Appendicula Vermiformis</hi> (which was in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> as 'ris in a <hi>Man,</hi> and is not to be met with in <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi>) was about the bigneſs of a Gooſe-quill. It's length I have mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>Into the <hi>Duodenum</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> a little below the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> were inſerted the <hi>Ductus Communis</hi> of the <hi>Gall,</hi> and the <hi>Ductus Pancreaticus;</hi> they both emptying themſelves into the Gut at the ſame <hi>Orifice</hi> as is uſual in <hi>Man.</hi> And the ſame is obſerved likewiſe by <hi>Drelincourt</hi> in the <hi>Male Ape</hi> he diffected, where he tells us, <hi>à Pyloro qui videtur ſuggrunda <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Convolutions and Windings of the <hi>ſmall Guts</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> and their Situation, were much the ſame, as in a <hi>Man</hi>: And they were all plentifully irrigated with <hi>Blood-Veſſels.</hi> In the inward Coat of the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> I could obſerve the <hi>Miliary Glands,</hi> deſcribed by Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>; as alſo thoſe larger cluſters of <hi>Glands,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Joh. Conrad. Peyerus.</hi> The <hi>Colon</hi> I thought proportionably longer, than 'tis in a <hi>Man.</hi> It had the ſame <hi>Ligaments</hi> and <hi>Cells,</hi> and leaves of <hi>Fat</hi> hanging to it, as a Man's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62473:23"/>
hath; and the ſituation, was the ſame: but it being ſo long, it had more windings than uſually. The <hi>Pariſians</hi> obſerved in their <hi>Monkeys,</hi> that the <hi>Colon was not redoubled like an S. as in Man, being quite ſtrait. Drelincourt's Ape</hi> was more like ours, for ſpeaking of the Colon, he ſaith, <hi>retorquetur variè antequàm producat Rectum; cellulas habet ut in Homine.</hi> For the length of the <hi>Colon</hi> in the <hi>Monkeys</hi> diffected by the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> was but thirteen Inches; and an Inch in Diameter; whereas, the <hi>Colon</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> with the <hi>Rectum,</hi> was three Foot five Inches, as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and therefore liker to a Man's, and requiring theſe convoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the more.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>Man</hi> the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> are commonly diſtinguiſhed into Inteſtina Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuia and <hi>Craſſa</hi>: The <hi>Tenuia</hi> are ſubdivided into the <hi>Duodenum, Jejunum,</hi> and <hi>Ileon</hi>; The <hi>Craſſa,</hi> into the <hi>Caecum, Colon</hi> and <hi>Rectum</hi>: and the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> commonly is reputed that <hi>Appendicula Vermiformis,</hi> which is placed at the beginning of the <hi>Colon,</hi> where the <hi>Ileon</hi> empties it ſelf into it. Now this Part in a <hi>Man,</hi> being ſo ſmall; and being obſerved never to contain any Excrement; I can't think, that it deſerves the Name of an <hi>Inteſtine,</hi> much leſs to be reputed one of the <hi>Craſſa.</hi> 'Tis true, in <hi>Brutes,</hi> this part is often ſound to be very large and capacious; and to be filled with <hi>faces</hi>; and in ſuch, it may be juſtly eſteemed an <hi>Inteſtine.</hi> As in a <hi>Rabit,</hi> 'tis very long and hath a <hi>Cochlear Valve</hi>; ſo in an Oſtridge, there are two <hi>Caecums</hi>; each a yard long, with a like <hi>Valve,</hi> But in <hi>Man,</hi> 'tis far different. Many therefore do not think this Proceſſus Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miformis, to be the Caecum; but rather take for is, that bunching out of the beginning of the <hi>Colon</hi>; which is projected beyond the entrance of the <hi>Ileon</hi>; which in the Common <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey</hi> is more, than in a <hi>Man.</hi> However, I think it not enough, as to make it a diſtinct: <hi>Inteſtine</hi>; and the number of the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> in a <hi>Man,</hi> ought to be made fewer.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Pygmie</hi> therefore having this <hi>Proceſſus Vermiformis</hi> in all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſo like to that in a <hi>Man</hi>; and <hi>Monkeys</hi> and <hi>Apes</hi> having nothing like it: it is a remarkable difference of our Subject from them, and an agreement to the Structure of a <hi>Humane</hi> Body. So the <hi>Pariſians</hi> tell us in their <hi>Monkeys, the Caecum had no Vermiform Appendix.</hi> So in the <hi>Ape</hi> diſſected by <hi>Blaſius,</hi> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo <hi>Drelincourt, Caecum caret Epiphyſi Vermiformi, qualem homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes habent.</hi> We will ſee therefore, what kind of <hi>Caecum</hi> 'tis, that they deſcribe in the <hi>Monkeys</hi> and <hi>Apes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pariſians</hi> tell us, in the Diffection of their <hi>Monkeys</hi>; That <hi>the</hi> Caecum <hi>was very large, containing two Inches and half in length; and an Inch Diameter at the beginning: it went pointing, and was fortified by three Ligaments, like as the</hi> Colon <hi>is in Man; there to form little Cells; this Conformation is wholly different from that of a Man's</hi> Caecum. 'Tis true, 'tis more projected, than in a Man; So <hi>Blaſius</hi> in his <hi>Ape,</hi> makes it jutting
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62473:24"/>
out beyond the Inſertion of the <hi>Ileon, Manûs tranſverſae, ſeu trium digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum ſpatium.</hi> And <hi>Drelincourt</hi> tells us, <hi>duarum unciarum est.</hi> But ſince it hath thoſe <hi>Ligaments</hi> of the <hi>Colon,</hi> 'tis plain, that 'tis only a part of it, and not a diſtinct Inteſtine; or as <hi>Blaſius</hi> more truly calls it, <hi>Principium Coli.</hi> He hath given a <hi>figure</hi> of it, but not very exact; and in another <hi>figure</hi> he repreſents the <hi>Valve</hi> of the <hi>Ileon</hi> at the <hi>Colon,</hi> or rather <hi>Valves</hi>; for he makes more than one. His <hi>Deſcription,</hi> as 'tis faultily printed; ſo I am afraid, it is not very accurately drawn up, and therefore do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
                  <p>But what is different from a <hi>Man,</hi> as alſo from the <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey</hi> too, or any other <hi>Animal</hi> I yet know of; is a ſort of <hi>Valve</hi> I obſerved at the other Extream of the <hi>Colon</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> where it paſſes into the <hi>Rectum.</hi> For the turn of the <hi>Colon</hi> here, is very ſhort; and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide I obſerved a Membranous Extenſion like a <hi>Valve,</hi> an Inch in length, which divided the Cavity half way. The <hi>Rectum</hi> did not much differ from the <hi>Colon</hi> in the magnitude of it's <hi>fistula,</hi> but was much the ſame; and in other reſpects, as 'tis in a <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This great length of the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was orderly colliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and faſtened to the <hi>Meſenterie,</hi> which kept them in a due ſituation; and ſo, as to make in them, ſeveral windings or convolutions; that hereby they might the better make a diſtribution of the <hi>Chyle</hi>; and the whole was, as 'tis in a Man. But I obſerved here, the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the <hi>Meſenterie,</hi> to be more looſly joyned together, than uſually. For by moving them by my fingers, I found the <hi>blood veſſels</hi> which were faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>upper Membrane,</hi> would eaſily ſhove over thoſe, that were fixt in the <hi>under Membrane</hi> of the <hi>Meſenterie</hi>; and run on either ſide of one another, as I would draw them. I have ſometimes ſeen the ſame in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Meſaraic Veſſels</hi> here, were very numerous; as they approach the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> they form ſeveral <hi>Arches,</hi> whereby they communicate with one another; and from theſe <hi>Arches,</hi> they ſend out numerous Branches to the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> of each ſide, which run claſping them; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſubdivide, and inoſculate with one another in infinite Ramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li: ſo that by injecting theſe <hi>Veſſels</hi> with <hi>Mercury,</hi> they appeared ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; as almoſt wholly to cover the Trunk of the <hi>Inteſtines.</hi> And the ſame is in <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have likewiſe ſeen, by injecting the <hi>Meſenterick Veſſels</hi>; that the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> has paſſed into the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi>; and ſo into the <hi>Venae</hi> or <hi>Vaſa La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctea.</hi> Which is a great contrivance of <hi>Nature.</hi> For the <hi>Motion</hi> of all <hi>fluids</hi> being <hi>Pulſion,</hi> without this advantage, part of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſtagnate in ſome of the Veſſels; till a freſh diſtribution of <hi>Chyle</hi> comes; to protrude it on; and ſo it would be apt to coagulate and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62473:24"/>
cauſe Obſtructions. But by the <hi>Lympha</hi> thus paſſing into them; the <hi>Chyle</hi> is ſtill forced forwards, and the <hi>veſſels</hi> waſhed clean of it; and being thus often moiſtened, they are preſerved from becoming over dry, or cloſed or obſtructed. So Provident therefore is <hi>Nature,</hi> that in the whole <hi>Via lactea,</hi> not only in the <hi>Meſenterie</hi>; but into the <hi>Receptaculum Chyli,</hi> and <hi>Ductus Thoracicus</hi> likewiſe; abundance of <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> are emptied. Which gives us one good Reaſon; that <hi>Nature</hi> does not act in vain, in making ſuch a ſeparation of à Liquor from the Maſs of Blood; which is ſo ſoon to be return'd to it again; ſince hereby ſhe performs ſo great an Office.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Meſenterie</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> I obſerved ſeveral ſmall <hi>Glands</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down, as in a <hi>Man</hi>; but not ſo regularly amaſſed together in the middle; as the <hi>Pancreas Aſellij</hi> is in <hi>Brutes.</hi> And <hi>Drelincourt</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved much the ſame in the <hi>Male Ape.

                  <p>We ſhall next proceed to the <hi>Liver,</hi> in which part our <hi>Pygmie</hi> very remarkably imitated a <hi>Man,</hi> more than our common <hi>Monkeys</hi> or <hi>Apes</hi> do.

half an inch broad; it had a great <hi>Ductus,</hi> which was immediately inſerted underneath the <hi>Pylorus.</hi> This <hi>Ductus</hi> received three others, which inſtead of that, which in Man is ſingle, and which is called <hi>Hepaticus</hi>; theſe three <hi>Ductus</hi>'s had their Branches diſperſed like Roots into all the Lobes of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo that the first had four roots, <hi>viz.</hi> one in each of the three right Lobes, and one in the first of the left; the ſecond and third <hi>Ductus</hi> had both their roots in the ſecond of the left Lobes, theſe branches did not run under the Tunicle of the Liver, ſo that they were apparent, and not hid in the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma, as they generally are. <hi>But in our Subject the diſtribution of the</hi> Ductus Hepaticus <hi>was altogether the ſame as it is in</hi> Man. <hi>In the</hi> Male Ape, Drelincourt <hi>deſcribing the</hi> Bladder <hi>of</hi> Gall, <hi>ſaith,</hi> Veſicula fellea longa 22/3 pollicibus à fundo ad cervicem, ubi recurvitatem habet maximam, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatè haeret merſa ſubſtantiae Jecoris.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Pariſians <hi>tell us, that in their</hi> Monkeys the Spleen was ſeated along the Ventricle as in Man; but it's figure was different, in one of our Subjects being made as the Heart is repreſented in Blazonry; it's <hi>Baſis</hi> containing an Inch. <hi>They give a</hi> figure <hi>of it, but nothing like that of ours, which more repreſented the figure of an</hi> Humane Spleen; <hi>tho' in</hi> Man <hi>it's</hi> figure <hi>is often obſerved very different.</hi> Blaſius <hi>in the</hi> Ape <hi>he diſſected, obſerves

                  <p>We come now to deſcribe the <hi>Teſtes,</hi> which in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> were not contained in a <hi>pendulous Scrotum,</hi> as they are in <hi>Man,</hi> but more contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and purſed up by the outward Skin, nearer to the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> and were ſeated by the ſides of the <hi>Penis,</hi> without the <hi>Os Pubis</hi>; and I obſerved them bunching out there, before the Diſſection; ſo that it ſeemed to want a <hi>Scrotum</hi>; or at leaſt the Skin which incloſed them, was not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as to hang down like a <hi>Cod</hi>; but contracted them up nearer to the Body of the <hi>Penis</hi> which to me ſeems a wiſe Contrivance of <hi>Nature.</hi> For hereby theſe Parts are leſs expoſed to the injuries, they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe receive in climbing Trees, or other accidents in the Woods. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the outward Skin here that incloſes them, performs altogether the office of a <hi>Scrotum.</hi> And if I miſtake not, I obſerved that <hi>Sepimentum,</hi> as in a <hi>Humane Scrotum</hi>; which is made by a deſcent of a <hi>Membrane</hi> there, which divides each <hi>Teſticle</hi> from one another.</p>
                  <p>But whether the <hi>Teſtes</hi> being thus cloſely purſed up to the Body, might contribute to that great <hi>ſalaciouſneſs</hi> this <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> are noted for, I will not determine: Tho' 'tis ſaid, that theſe <hi>Animals,</hi> that have their <hi>Teſticles</hi> contained within the Body, are more inclined to it, than others. That the whole <hi>Ape</hi>-kind is extreamly given to <hi>Venery,</hi> appears by inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Stories related of them.

Our</hi> Pygmie <hi>in this Particular of the</hi> Scrotum, <hi>more reſembles the</hi> Ape-<hi>kind, than a</hi> Man. <hi>For the</hi> Pariſians <hi>tell us, that</hi> the Parts of Generation in three of our Subjects, which were Males, were different from thoſe of Man, there being no <hi>Scrotum</hi> in two of theſe Subjects, and the Teſticles not appearing, by reaſon that they were hid in the fold of the Groyne. It is true that the third, which was one of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pajous,</hi> had a <hi>Scrotum,</hi> but it was ſo ſhrunk, that it did not appear. <hi>Or, as they afterwards expreſs it,</hi> The Teſticles were ſhut up in a <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which joyned them cloſe up to the <hi>Penis. So in the</hi> Ape Blaſius <hi>deſcribes,</hi> Teſtes inſignes ſatis, ſacculo ſuo incluſi, non dependent extra abdomen, ad modum eum quo in Homine, Canibus, ſimilibuſque Animalibus aliis, ſed vicini adeò ſunt tendinibus muſculorum Abdominis, quos vaſa Spermatica tranſeunt, ac ſi iis uniti eſſent, ſic ut potiùs in Inguine utroque collocatos eos dicerem, quàm ultra oſſa Pubis a Corpore pendulos, <hi>And ſo</hi> Drelincourt <hi>to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>; Scrotum pendulum nullum est, ſest Teſticuli utrinque juxta Oſſis Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſumma latera, vel Spinam ſummam ejus decumbunt extra prorſus Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis cavum, &amp; proindè extra Muſculorum Epigaſtrij Aponeuroſes.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Pariſians <hi>tell us, that in ſome of their Subjects the</hi> Teſticles were long and ſtrait, and but one line in breadth, and eight in length.

                  <p>From the <hi>Epididymis</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> (as it is in a <hi>Man</hi>) was continued the <hi>Vas Deferens</hi>; a ſlender <hi>Ductus,</hi> which conveys the <hi>Semen</hi> from the <hi>Teſticle</hi> to the <hi>Veſiculae Seminales.</hi> Theſe <hi>Veſiculae</hi> were two <hi>cellulated Bladders</hi> placed under the neck of the <hi>Bladder</hi> of <hi>

                  <p>Between the root of the <hi>Penis,</hi> and neck of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> is ſeated the <hi>Corpus Glanduloſum,</hi> or the <hi>Prostatae,</hi> which in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> appeared the ſame as in <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Pariſians</hi> tell us in their <hi>Monkeys</hi> that they were ſmall. <hi>Blaſius</hi> in his <hi>figure,</hi> beſides the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> which he ſaith are <hi>Glandula veſicis adſtans, albidior ſolidiorque</hi> repreſents another, at the Letters (H.

                  <p>We come now to the <hi>Penis,</hi> which in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was two Inches long; the girth of it at the root was an Inch and a quarter; but it grew taperer towards the end. It had no <hi>fraenum,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Praepuce</hi> could be retracted wholly down; and herein our <hi>Pygmie</hi> is different from a <hi>Man.</hi> The Slit of the <hi>Penis</hi> here was perpendicular as in a <hi>Man.</hi> In the <hi>figure</hi> the <hi>Pariſians</hi> give us, it ſeems to be horizontal, as it is plainly repreſented by <hi>Bartholine</hi> in his <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth figure</hi> of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momet,</hi> altho by his <hi>ſecond figure</hi> one would think otherwiſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any <hi>Balanus</hi> or <hi>Glans</hi> in the <hi>Penis</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> or what it was, I am uncertain: I do not remember I obſerved any. In my <hi>third figure</hi> the <hi>Penis</hi> is repreſented decurtated at the end, and without the <hi>Praeputium,</hi> which was left entire to the Skin. <hi>Dreclincourt</hi>'s account of it in the <hi>Ape</hi> is this; <hi>Genitale prorsùs expers est fraenuli ac proinde Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putium devolvitur ad radicem uſque Penis, &amp; denudatur Glans ipſa, atque Penis integer. Balanus conſimilis virili, excepto fraenulo, atque praeterea hiatum maximum exhibet, quâ parte Ligamenta Cavernoſa deſinant, &amp; Glans utrinque prominet.</hi> At the root of the <hi>Penis</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> we obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Muſculi Erectores</hi> to be ſhort, and thicker proportionably than in a <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Ligamentum Suſpenſorium</hi> larger: The <hi>Muſculus accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinae</hi> was large, covering the <hi>Bulb</hi> of the <hi>Cavernous body</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> The <hi>Corpora Nervoſa,</hi> or the two <hi>Cavernous bodies</hi> of the <hi>Penis</hi> were divided length-ways by a <hi>Sepimentum</hi> in the middle, as in <hi>Man.</hi> In the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> likewiſe there was a <hi>Cavernous body.</hi> The <hi>Veſſels</hi> of the <hi>Penis</hi> anſwered exactly to thoſe of a <hi>Man.</hi>

                  <p>Blaſius <hi>in his</hi> Ape <hi>faith,</hi> Penis Nervoſum Corpus unicum tantum habere videtur, ſepimento notabili deſtitutum. <hi>But I am apt to think he might be miſtaken; for in our Subject 'twas very plainly divided, but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably

towards the root than forwards. What he adds afterwards,</hi> Circa radicem Penis Tuberculum exile occurrit, exteriùs carnoſae naturae, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriùs reticulari vaſorum plexu refertum, interſtitia ipſius materiâ rubicundâ occupante, <hi>by this I ſuppoſe he means the</hi> Bulb <hi>of the</hi> Penis. Drelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court <hi>expreſſes it better, where he ſaith,</hi> Totus Penis duobus Ligamentis Cavernoſis à tuberibus Iſchij gaudet. <hi>In our Subject theſe two bodies were very large and</hi> cavernous <hi>within. But what</hi> Drelincourt <hi>adds,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra, planè carnoſa; <hi>This was different in our</hi> Pygmie; <hi>for as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, the ſides of the</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How the</hi> Organs <hi>of</hi> Generation <hi>are in the</hi> Female <hi>of this</hi> Species <hi>of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, <hi>I have had no opportunity of informing my ſelf. But by</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy <hi>I can't but think, they muſt be very like to thoſe of a</hi> Woman, <hi>ſince they are ſo even in</hi> Monkeys <hi>and</hi> Apes <hi>in ſeveral reſpect; tho' in ſome, they imitate the Structure of theſe Parts in</hi> Brutes. <hi>Thus the</hi> Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>obſerve,</hi> The generative Parts of the Female had alſo a great many things which rendered them different from thoſe of <hi>Bitches,</hi> herein reſembling thoſe of <hi>Women</hi>; there were ſome of them likewiſe which were as in <hi>Bitches,</hi> and after another manner than in <hi>Woman</hi>; for the exteriour Orifice was round and ſtrait, as in <hi>Bitches,</hi> and the generality of other Brutes, and had neither <hi>Nymphae</hi> nor <hi>Carunculae.</hi> The Neck of the Bladder had it's hole otherwiſe than in <hi>Woman,</hi> being very far in the Neck of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> viz. towards the middle, at the place where it's roughneſs began, which were ſeen only towards the extremity of the <hi>Ductus</hi> near the Internal Orifice. The Trunks of the <hi>Matrix</hi> were alſo different from thoſe of Women, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoſe of Brutes in that they were proportionably longer, and more redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by various turnings. The <hi>Clitoris</hi> had ſomething more conformable to that which is ſeen in other Brutes that have it, than in that of Women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportionably greater, and more viſible than it is in Women. It was compoſed of two Nervous and Spongious Ligaments, which proceeding from the lower part of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> and obliquely advancing to the ſides of theſe Bones, did unite to form a third Body, which was ten lines in length. It was formed by uniting of the two first, which a very ſtrong Membrane joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, going from one of the Ligaments to the other, beſides a hard and nervous Membrane which inveloped them. They terminated at a Gland like to that of the <hi>Penis</hi> of the Male. The little Muſcles, which were faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to theſe Ligaments, proceeded as uſual from the tuberoſities of the <hi>Iſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Theſe Ligaments were of Subſtance ſo thin and ſpongious, that the wind penetrated, and made them eaſily to ſwell, when blown into the Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, of the Veins and Arteries which is in this place. This Network was viſible in this Subject, being compoſed of larger Veſſels than they proportionably are in Women. It was ſituated as uſually under the ſecond pair of Muſcles of the <hi>Clitoris.</hi> It's figure was Pyramidal, ending from a very large <hi>Baſis</hi> in a point, which run along the third Ligament to it's extremity towards the Gland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62473:30"/>The rest of the Parts of Generation were like to thoſe of Women. The Neck of the Bladder had it's Muſcles as in Women: For there were a great number of fleſhy Fibres, which proceeding from the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> were faſtened to the ſides of the Neck of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and other ſuch like Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres which did come from the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Bladder to inſert them ſelves at the ſame place. The Body of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> it's Membranes, internal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it's Ligaments as well the round as broad, and all it's Veſſels had a conformation intirely like to that, which theſe ſame Parts have in Women. The Teſticles, which were ten lines long, and two broad, were as in Women, compoſed of a great number of ſmall Bladders, and faſtned near the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes which are at the extremity of the <hi>Tubae,</hi> and which is called their Fringe.</p>
                  <p>Drelincourt <hi>hath very little on this Subject, all he ſaith is,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra rubicunda ſolida &amp; brevis. Vagina admodum rugoſa, monticulum habens in medio, Papillis extuberans ut in Palato, Pollicem longa, tranſverſim ſciſſa, Pollicem lata. Orificium interiùs valdè ſolidum. Cervix interior admodùm dura, &amp; paulò intrà oſculum internum duritie cartilaginoſâ.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall proceed now to the Parts of the <hi>Middle Venter,</hi> the <hi>Thorax</hi>; and here, as the Parts are fewer, ſo my Remarks will be alſo: and the rather, becauſe in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> we obſerved ſo very little difference from the Structure of the ſame Parts in a <hi>Man.</hi> I muſt confeſs I can't be ſo particular in all Circumſtances, as I would, becauſe for the preſerving the <hi>Sceleton</hi> more entire, I did not take off the <hi>Sternum.</hi> However, I obſerved enough to ſatisfie my ſelf with what I thought moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Cavity</hi> was divided from the <hi>Abdomen</hi> by the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> whoſe <hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> or <hi>Tendon</hi> ſeemed rather larger than in a <hi>Man</hi>: and the <hi>ſecond Muſcle</hi> which encompaſſed the <hi>Gula,</hi> as it paſſes through it, was very fair.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Lungs <hi>in our</hi> Pygmie <hi>had three</hi> Lobes <hi>on one ſide, and but two on the other; five in all. Their Colour, Subſtance, Situation, and all Circumſtances exactly reſemble a</hi> Man's. <hi>The</hi> Pariſians <hi>tell us, that in their</hi> Monkeys the Lungs had ſeven Lobes, three on the right ſide, and as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62473:31"/>
many on the left, the ſeventh was in the Cavity of the <hi>Mediaſtine,</hi> as in the generality of Brutes. This again makes a notable difference between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of the <hi>Ape,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Man,</hi> whoſe Lungs have generally at the most but five Lobes, oftener but four, and ſometimes but two. <hi>Veſalius</hi> affirms that he never ſaw in Man this fifth Lobe, which he reports to be in <hi>Apes,</hi> ſuppoſing that they have but five. <hi>The Paſſage that the</hi> Pariſians <hi>hint at in</hi> Veſalius <hi>is this,</hi> Lobum autem qui in Canbus, ſimiiſque Venae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae Caudicem ſuffulcit, nunquam in homine obſervavi, &amp; hunc illo deſtitui certo certius ſcio, quamvis interim <hi>Galeni</hi> locus in ſeptimo de adminiſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis Diſſectionibus mihi memoria non exciderit, quo inquit, quintum hunc Pulmonis Lobum eos non latêre, qui recte ſectionem adminiſtrant; innuens <hi>Herophilo &amp; Marino</hi> ejuſmodi Lobum fuiſſe incognitum, uti ſanè fuit, cùm illi Hominum Cadavera, non autem cum ipſo, ſimiarum ac Canum dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxat aggrederentur, in quibus praeſenti Lobo nihil est manifeſtius.<note n="(72)" place="bottom">Andr.

                     <hi>Tho</hi> Galen <hi>be herein miſtaken,</hi> Veſalius <hi>certainly is too ſevere in his Cenſure, in charging him, that he never diſſected any thing but</hi> Apes <hi>and</hi> Dogs; <hi>for the contrary evidently appears in abundance of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that might be produced. And one would think he had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected</hi> Apes <hi>and</hi> Monkeys <hi>in making but five</hi> Lobes <hi>in their</hi> Lungs, <hi>whereas in either there are more. In what he argues, that this</hi> fifth Lobe <hi>in a Man could not lie upon the</hi> Vena Cava; <hi>becauſe in a</hi> Man <hi>the</hi> Pericardium <hi>is faſtened to the</hi> Diaphragm, <hi>and the</hi> Vana Cava <hi>enters there, and ſo immediately paſſes to the</hi> Heart; <hi>this is true, and the ſame I obſerved in our</hi> Paymie. <hi>So that in the formation of this Part, our</hi> Pygmie <hi>exactly reſembles a</hi> Man; <hi>and is different from both the</hi> Mankey <hi>and</hi> Ape-<hi>kind. The former we have ſeen; as to the latter,</hi> Drelincourt <hi>tells us in the</hi> Male Ape; Pulmo dexter quadrifidus, Lobus inſimus omnium craſſiſſimus, ſuperior minùs craſſus, intermedius reapsè medius ſilu &amp; magnitudine.

                  <p>The <hi>Trachaea</hi> or <hi>wind-pipe</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was altogether the ſame as in a <hi>Man</hi>; conſiſting of a regular order of <hi>Cartilaginous Annuali,</hi> which were not perfectly continued round; but towards the <hi>Spine,</hi> were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſtrong Membrane. <hi>Drelincourt</hi> ſaith of it, <hi>Trachaeae annuli ſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent uti Inteſtinourm ſpirae, nervoſis Membranis colliguntur.</hi> The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, I think, is not ſo well made.</p>

                  <p>Now our <hi>Pygmie</hi> having the <hi>Pericardium</hi> thus faſtened to the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm,</hi> it ſeems to me, as if Nature deſigned it to be a <hi>Biped</hi> and to go <hi>erect.</hi> For therefore in a Man is the <hi>Pericardium</hi> thus faſtened, that in <hi>Expiration</hi> it might aſſiſt the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi>: for otherwiſe the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Stomach</hi> being ſo weighty, they would draw it down too much towards the <hi>Abdomen</hi>; ſo that upon the <hi>relaxation</hi> of it's Fibres in it's <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> it would not aſcend ſufficiently into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> ſo as to cauſe a Subſidence of the <hi>Lungs</hi> by leſſening the Cavity there. In <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds</hi> there is no need of this adhaeſion of the <hi>Pericardium</hi> to the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm</hi>: For in them, in <hi>Expiration,</hi> when the Fibres of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> are relaxed, the weight of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> will eaſily preſs the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> up, into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and ſo perform that Service. Beſides, was the <hi>Pericardium</hi> faſtened to the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> in <hi>Quadrupeds,</hi> it would hinder it's <hi>Syſtole</hi> in <hi>Inſpiration</hi>; or it's deſcent downwards upon the contraction of it's <hi>Muſcular Fibres</hi>; and the more, becauſe the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> being thus tied up, it could not then ſo freely force down the weight of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> which are always preſſing upon it, and conſequently not ſufficiently dilate the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and therefore muſt hinder their <hi>Inſpiration.</hi> Thus we ſee how neceſſary it is,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62473:32"/>
that in a <hi>Man</hi> the <hi>Pericardium</hi> ſhould be faſtened to the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> and in <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> how inconvenient it would be; that from hence I think we may ſafely conclude, that <hi>Nature</hi> deſign'd our <hi>Pygmie</hi> to go erect, ſince in this particular 'tis ſo like a <hi>Man</hi>; which the common <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi> are not; and tho' they are taught to go <hi>erect,</hi> yet 'tis no more than what <hi>Dogs</hi> may be taught to do.</p>

In a Man I have always obſerved this part to be red. <hi>Drelincourt</hi>'s Account of it in the <hi>Ape</hi> is, <hi>Glandulae Thyroideae &amp; Cricoideae craſſae ſunt, &amp; ſubnigricantes; &amp; illas permeant ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi Corotidis Arteriae &amp; Jugular is venae externae; cum ſurculis Nervi Recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentis.</hi> There is no ſenſible account yet given of the uſe of this part, as I have met with: And I think that from a Comparative Survey of it in other Animals, and a ſtrict Obſervation of it's Structure, and the Veſſels that compound it, it were not difficult to aſſign other uſes of it more ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Larynx</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> unleſs I enumerate all the <hi>Cartilages</hi> that go to form it, and the <hi>Muſcles</hi> that ſerve to give them their Motion, and the <hi>Veſſels</hi> that run to and from it, and the <hi>Membranes</hi> and <hi>Glands,</hi> there is nothing that I can further add, but only ſay, that I found the whole Structure of this Part exactly as 'tis in <hi>Man.</hi> And the ſame too I muſt ſay of the <hi>Os Hyoides.</hi> The <hi>Reflection</hi> that the <hi>Pariſians</hi> make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the obſervation of this, and it's neighbouring Parts in the Diſſection of their <hi>Monkey</hi>'s, I think is very juſt and valuable. And if there was any further advantage for the forming of <hi>Speech,</hi> I can't but think our <hi>Pygmie</hi> had it. But upon the beſt Enquiry, I was never informed, that it attempted any thing that way. Tho' <hi>Birds</hi> have been taught to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Humane Voice,</hi> and to pronounce Words and Sentences, yet <hi>Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds</hi> never; neither has this <hi>Quadru-manous Species</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> that ſo nearly app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>But before I leave theſe Parts, there are ſome others I muſt here take notice of, in this</hi> Comparative Survey; <hi>which tho' they are not to be met with, either in our</hi> Pygmie <hi>or in</hi> Man; <hi>yet are very remarkable, both in the</hi> Monkey <hi>and</hi> Ape-kind, <hi>viz. thoſe</hi> Pouches <hi>the</hi> Monkeys <hi>and</hi> Apes <hi>have in their</hi> Chaps, <hi>which ſerve them as</hi> Repoſitories <hi>for to hoard up, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion, food in; when they are not diſpoſed for the preſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it; but when there</hi> Stomachs <hi>ſerve them, they then take it out thence and ſo eat it. That the</hi> Ape-kind <hi>has theſe</hi> Pouches, Drelincourt <hi>does inform us; where he tells us,</hi> Muſculus latiſſimus Mentum univerſum &amp; buccas obtegit, quâ parts ſimiae ſaccum formant, intra quem Eſculenta recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt. Pliny <hi>is very expreſs, That both</hi> Satyrs <hi>and</hi> Sphinges (<hi>which I make to be of the</hi> Monkey kind) <hi>have them likewiſe,</hi>

It's ſituation was on the outſide of each Jaw, reaching ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely from the middle of the Jaw to the under part of it's Angle, paſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a part of the Muſcle called <hi>Longiſſimus.</hi> It was an Inch and an half long, and almost as broad towards it's bottom. It opened into the Mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jaw and the bottom of the Gum. 'Tis into this Pouch that Apes uſe to put what they would keep; and it is probable that the Muſculous Fibres which it has, do ſerve to ſhut and open it, to receive and put out what theſe Animals do there lay up in reſerve. <hi>Now our</hi> Pygmie <hi>having none of theſe</hi> Pouches <hi>in it's Chaps, nor nothing like them; 'tis a notable difference both from the</hi> Monkey <hi>and</hi> Ape-kind, <hi>and an Agreement with the</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>

                  <p>We proceed now to the <hi>upper Venter,</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> where at preſent we ſhall examine the <hi>Brain</hi>; that Part, which if we had proceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Method of Nature</hi> in forming the Parts, we muſt have began with. For I can't but think, as 'tis the firſt Part we obſerve formed, ſo that the whole of the Body, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the <hi>Containing Parts,</hi> have their riſe from it. But I ſhall not enlarge upon this Argument here; it would be too great a digreſſion, to give my Reaſons for ſuch an <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> From what is generally received, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Brain</hi> is reputed the more immediate Seat of the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf; one would be apt to think, that ſince there is ſo great a diſparity between the <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> and a <hi>Brute,</hi> the <hi>Organ</hi> likewiſe in which 'tis placed ſhould be very different too. Yet by comparing the <hi>Brain</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> with that of a <hi>Man</hi>; and, with the greateſt exactneſs, obſerving each Part in both; it was very ſurpriſing to me to find ſo great a reſemblance of the one to the other, that nothing could be more. So that when I am deſcribing the <hi>Brain</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> you may juſtly ſuſpect I am deſcribing that of a Man, or may think that I might very well omit it wholly, by referring you to the accounts already given of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of an <hi>Humane Brain,</hi> for that will indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſerve for our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> by allowing only for the magnitude of the Parts in <hi>Man.</hi> Tho' at the ſame time I muſt obſerve, that proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Bulk of the Body, the <hi>Brain</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> was extreamly large; for it weighed (the greateſt part of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> being taken off) twelve Ounces, wanting only a Dram. The <hi>Pariſians</hi> remark, that in their <hi>Monkeys the</hi> Brain <hi>was large in proportion to the Body, it weighing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>o Ounces and a half</hi>: which nevertheleſs was inconſiderable to ours; ſince our <hi>Pygmie</hi> exceeded not the Stature and Bulk of the Common <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> or <hi>Ape</hi>; ſo that herein, as in a great many other Circumſtances, our <hi>Pygmie</hi> is different from the Common <hi>Monkey</hi> and <hi>Ape,</hi> and more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can't agree with <hi>Veſalius,</hi> that the Structure of the <hi>Brain</hi> of all <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds,</hi> my all <hi>Birds,</hi> and of ſome <hi>Fiſhes</hi> too, is the ſame as in Man.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62473:34"/>
There is a vaſt difference to be obſerved in the formation of the Parts, that ſerve to compoſe the <hi>Brain</hi> in theſe various <hi>Animals.</hi> And tho' the <hi>Brain</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> in reſpect of his Body, be much larger than what is to be met with in any other <hi>Animal</hi> (for <hi>Veſalius</hi> makes the <hi>Brain</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> to be as big as thoſe of three Oxen) yet I think we can't ſafely conclude with him, that <hi>Animals,</hi> as they excell in the largeneſs of the <hi>Brain,</hi> ſo they do likewiſe in the Principal Faculties of the <hi>Soul</hi>: For if this be true, then our <hi>Pygmie</hi> muſt equal a <hi>Man,</hi> or come very near him, ſince his <hi>Brain</hi> in proportion to his Body, was as large as a <hi>Man's.

                  <p>Since therefore in all reſpects the <hi>Brain</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> does ſo exactly reſemble a <hi>Man</hi>'s, I might here make the ſame Reflection the <hi>Pariſians</hi> did upon the <hi>Organs of Speech, That there is no reaſon to think, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents do perform ſuch and ſuch Actions, becauſe they are found with Organs proper thereunto</hi>: for then our <hi>Pygmie</hi> might be really a <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> in <hi>Animal</hi> Bodies are only a regular <hi>Compages</hi> of Pipes and Veſſels, for the <hi>Fluids</hi> to paſs through, and are paſſive. What actuates them, are the <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Fluids</hi>: and <hi>Animal Life</hi> conſiſts in their due and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion in this <hi>Organical</hi> Body. But thoſe <hi>Nobler Faculties</hi> in the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> muſt certainly have a <hi>higher Principle</hi>; and <hi>Matter orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized</hi> could never produce them; for why elſe, where the <hi>Organ</hi> is the ſame, ſhould not the <hi>Actions</hi> be the ſame too? and if all depended on the <hi>Organ,</hi> not only our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> but other <hi>Brutes</hi> likewiſe, would be too near akin to us. This Difference I cannot but remark, that the <hi>Ancients</hi> were fond of making <hi>Brutes</hi> to be <hi>Men</hi>: on the contrary now, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophically, the <hi>Humour</hi> is, to make <hi>Men</hi> but meer <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Whereas in truth <hi>Man</hi> is part a <hi>Brute,</hi> part an <hi>Angel</hi>; and is that <hi>Link</hi> in the <hi>Creation,</hi> that joyns them both together.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Digreſſim</hi> may be the more pardonable, becauſe I have ſo little to ſay here, beſides juſt naming the <hi>Parts</hi>; and to tell you (what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) that they were all like to thoſe in a <hi>Man</hi>: For the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> as a <hi>Common Membrane,</hi> firmiy ſecured the ſituation of the whole <hi>Brain</hi> ſtrictly

adhering to the <hi>Sutures</hi> of the <hi>Cranium</hi> above; before to the <hi>Criſta Galli</hi>; and at the <hi>baſis</hi> ſo ſtrongly, that it was not eaſily to be ſeparated.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pia Mater</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was a fine thin Membrane which more immediately covered the Subſtance of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and may be reckoned it's <hi>proper Membrane</hi>; inſinuating it's ſelf all along between the <hi>Anfractus</hi> of the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and the <hi>Circilli</hi> of the <hi>Cerebellum</hi>; being copiouſly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with numerous Branches of <hi>Blood Veſſels,</hi> but they appear'd more on the <hi>Convex</hi> Part, then at the <hi>Baſis.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>figure</hi> of the whole <hi>Brain</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was globous; but by means of a greater jutting in of the Bones of the <hi>Orbit</hi> of the <hi>Eye,</hi> there was occaſioned a deeper depreſſion on the <hi>Anterior Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi> in this place, than in a <hi>Man.</hi> As to other Circumſtances here, I obſerved all Parts the ſame. The <hi>Anfractus</hi> of the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> were alike; as alſo the <hi>Subſtantia Corticalis</hi> and <hi>Medullaris.</hi> On the <hi>baſis</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> we may view all the <hi>Ten pair</hi> of <hi>Nerves</hi> exactly ſituated and placed as in a <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Brain</hi>; nor did I find their Originations different, or any Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity that was ſo.

Here was the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundibulum,</hi> the <hi>Glandulae duae albae ponè Infundibulum,</hi> the <hi>Medulla</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longata with it's <hi>Annular Protuberance,</hi> and the beginning of the <hi>Medulla, Spinalis,</hi> juſt as in <hi>Man.</hi> I am here only a <hi>Nomenclator,</hi> for want of Matter to make particular Remarks upon. And the Authorrs that have hitherto furniſhed me with Notes, how the ſame <hi>Parts</hi> are in <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys,</hi> do fail me now; it may be, finding here nothing new or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, they are therefore ſilent. All the <hi>Pariſians</hi> do tell us of the <hi>Brain</hi> in their <hi>Monkeys</hi> is this:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brain</hi> was large in proportion to the Body: It weighed two Ounces and an half. The <hi>Dura Mater</hi> entered very far to form the <hi>Falx.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſractuoſities of the External part of the Brain were very like thoſe of Man in the Anteriour part; but in the inward parts before the Cerebellum, there was hardly any: they in requital were much deeper in proportion. The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſes,</hi> which are called <hi>Mamillares,</hi> which are great Nerves that do ſerve to the ſmelling, were not ſoft, as in Man, but hard and membranous. The <hi>Optick</hi> Nerves were alſo of a Subſtance harder and firmer than ordinary. The <hi>Glandula Pinealis</hi> was of a Conical figure, and it's point was turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the binder part of the Head. There was no <hi>Rete Mirabile</hi>: for the <hi>Carotides</hi> being entered into the Brain, went by one ſingle Trunk on each ſide
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62473:35"/>
of the edge of the ſeat of the <hi>Sphenoides</hi> to pierce the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and to be diſtributed into the baſis of the Brain. <hi>In our Subject I thought the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractus <hi>of the Brain much the ſame, both in the anteriour and hinder part. Nor did I obſerve any difference in the</hi> Mamillary Proceſſes <hi>or</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerves, <hi>or</hi> Rete Mirabile, <hi>but all, as in a</hi> Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Cerebellum <hi>in our</hi> Pygmie <hi>was divided by</hi> Circilli, <hi>as in</hi> Man. <hi>It had likewiſe the</hi> Proceſſus Vermiformes, <hi>Dr.</hi> Willis <note n="(80)" place="bottom">Willis Cerebri Anat. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note>

                  <head>THE OSTEOLOGY, OR DESCRIPTION OF THE BONES.</head>
                  <p>WE come now to the <hi>Oſteology,</hi> to give a <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> by comparing which, with that of a <hi>Man,</hi> an <hi>Ape</hi> and a <hi>Monkey</hi> we may obſerve (as we have already of the other Parts) that here too, our <hi>Pygmie</hi> more reſembles a <hi>Man</hi> than <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkey's</hi> do; but where it differs, there 'tis like the <hi>Ape-kind. Galen</hi> (as I have already quoted him, <hi>vid. p.</hi> 15.) tells us that <hi>an Ape of all Creatures is the most like to a Man in the</hi> Viſcera, <hi>Muſcles, Arteries, Veins and Nerves, becauſe 'tis ſo in the Structure of the Bones.</hi> But it may be queſtioned, Whether even the Structure of the <hi>Bones</hi> themſelves, does not depend upon that of the <hi>Muſcles</hi>: ſince in their firſt Formation, they are <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>vaſcular</hi>; then <hi>Cartilaginous,</hi> and in time at laſt are hardened into <hi>Bones.</hi> In <hi>Ricketty Children</hi> too, we find, that even the <hi>Bones</hi> are rendered crooked, by the Contraction of the <hi>Muſcles,</hi> how much more, when they are tender and ſoft, might they be bended any way by them. But by underſtanding exactly the Structure of the <hi>Bones,</hi> we ſhall the better apprehend the Riſe and Inſertions of the <hi>Muſcles.</hi> And for the better attaining this, <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſame Chaper <note n="(81)" place="bottom">Galen. de Anat. adminiſtr. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>p. m.</hi> 29, 30</note> recommends to his <hi>Students,</hi> when they cannot have an opportunity of Conſulting an <hi>Humane Sceleton,</hi> then to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62473:36"/>
make uſe of thoſe of <hi>Apes</hi>; not that he thinks them both alike, but the moſt like: and tells them, that it was worth their while on this account to go to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where the Phyſicians taught their Scholars the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Bones from the Inſpection of <hi>Humane Sceletons</hi> themſelves, which he much prefers before Books. But ſince in his time <hi>Humane Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons</hi> were not to be had but at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for the ſupplying this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they might obſerve the <hi>Bones</hi> of <hi>Apes</hi>; and after that, they might read his Book <hi>De Oſſium Naturâ,</hi> and to do as he did, viſit the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> and Graves, and to obſerve there the <hi>Humane Bones</hi> themſelves: And he tells us of two <hi>Sceletons</hi> he made uſe of; One that the River had waſhed out of a <hi>Tomb,</hi> where the Fleſh was corrupted and waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet the Bones held together. The other was of a Thief that was Executed, who was ſo much hated, that none would bury him; but the Birds pick'd off his Fleſh, and left his <hi>Bones</hi> as a <hi>Sceleton.</hi> But ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. i.e. <hi>If yon can't happen to ſee any of theſe, diſſect an Ape, carefully view each Bone,</hi> &amp;c. Then he adviſes what ſort of Apes to make choice of, as moſt reſembling a Man: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e. <hi>One ought to know the Structure of all the Bones either in a Humane Body, or in an Ape's; 'tis beſt in both; and then to go to the Anatomy of the Muſcles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What <hi>Galen</hi> adviſed, no doubt he practiſed himſelf, and obſerved both. But <hi>Andreas Veſalius</hi> will not allow him this: For in his great and excellent Book <hi>De Corporis Humani Fabricâ,</hi> he all along tell's us, that <hi>Galen</hi> gives us rather the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Apes</hi> than of a <hi>Man</hi>: And in his <hi>Epiſtola ad Joachimum Roelants de Radice Chynae,</hi> his chief Deſign is to prove, that <hi>Galen</hi> never diſſected a <hi>Humane Body</hi>: and that he is often miſtaken in the Hiſtory of the Parts, as alſo in their Uſes; and that his Reaſonings are frequently unconcluſive.</p>
                  <p>Upon the coming out of <hi>Veſalius</hi> his firſt Book, he was warmly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Jacobus Sylvius</hi> a Phyſician at <hi>Paris,</hi> who had formerly been <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalius</hi> his Maſter in <hi>Anatomy</hi>; in a Treatiſe ſtiled <hi>Depulſio Veſani cujuſdane Calumniarum in Hippocratis &amp; Galeni Rem Anatomicam.</hi> This was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not long after by <hi>Renatus Henerus,</hi> who publiſhed another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, <hi>viz. Adverſus Jacobi Sylvij Depulſionum Anatomicarum Calumnias pro Andreâ Veſalio Apologia. Sylvius</hi> afterwards procures a Diſciple of his to write againſt <hi>Veſalius,</hi> who puts out, but unſucceſsfully, <hi>Apologia pro Galeno contra Andream Veſalium Bruxellenſem, Franciſco Puteo Medico Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenſi Authore.</hi> A Scholar of <hi>Veſalius, Gabriel Cunaeus,</hi> makes a Reply to <hi>Puteus</hi> in his <hi>Apologiae Franciſci Putei pro Galeno in Anatome examen.</hi> Upon <hi>Veſalius</hi> his leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> a Diſciple of his, <hi>Realdus Columbus,</hi> grew very famous for <hi>Anatomy,</hi> but ungrateful to his Maſter, as <hi>Veſalius</hi>

complains in his Book <hi>De Radice Chynae,</hi> and his <hi>Examen Obſervationum Falloppij.</hi> But <hi>Gabriel Falloppius</hi> was always kinder to him, and mentions him with the greateſt Honour, and calls him <hi>Divine</hi>; tho' in ſeveral things he diſſents from him, which occaſioned <hi>Veſalius</hi> his putting out his <hi>Obſervationum Falloppij Examen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Realdus Columbus</hi> was ſucceeded at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Bartholomaeus Euſtachius</hi>; a Man very knowing and curious in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> but extreamly devoted to <hi>Galen,</hi> as one may ſee by this Paſſage; <hi>

                     <note n="(82)" place="bottom">Barthol. Euſtachij Oſſium Examen, <hi>p. m.</hi> 189.</note>. Too great a Partiality for ſo ingenious a Man. And it may be, this was one Reaſon why <hi>Veſalius</hi> ſo much endeavoured to leſſen <hi>Galen</hi>'s Authority; becauſe the Humour of the Age was ſuch, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then was to be received, but what was to be met with in him. But certainly they are in the wrong, who, becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> is miſtaken in ſome things, do now wholly reject him, and lay him aſide as good for nothing. The wiſeſt and moſt experienced in the <hi>Art</hi> may read his Works, and in reading him, if juſt and not prejudiced, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a Satisfaction and an Advantage they have received from him.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign of <hi>Bartholomaeus Euſtachius</hi> in writing that Diſcourſe of his, <hi>Oſſium Examen,</hi> is to juſtifie <hi>Galen,</hi> that he did not only diſſect <hi>Apes,</hi> but <hi>Humane Bodies</hi> likewiſe; and that his Deſcriptions are conformable to the Parts in <hi>Man,</hi> and not to <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys.</hi> He therefore draws a Compariſon between the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of an <hi>Ape</hi> and a <hi>Man</hi>; and ſhews wherein they differ; and how far <hi>Galen</hi>'s Deſcriptions of thoſe Parts are different from thoſe in an <hi>Ape. Volcherus Coiter</hi> has likewiſe made the ſame <hi>Comparative Survey,</hi> in his <hi>Analogia Oſſium Humanorum, Simiae &amp; verae &amp; caudatae, quae Cynocephali ſimilis est, atque Vulpis.</hi> In moſt things I find <hi>Coiter</hi> to follow <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> but <hi>Euſtachius</hi> I think is to be preferred, becauſe in his <hi>Annotationes de Oſſibus,</hi> he quotes the Texts of <hi>Galen</hi> at large. <hi>Johannes Riolanus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> hath wrote upon the ſame Argument likewiſe; <hi>viz. Simiae Oſteologia five Oſſium Simiae &amp; Hominis Comparatio</hi>; and he being later than either of the former, and having made uſe of all before him, he may be thought to be the moſt exact.</p>
                  <p>In giving therefore an Account of the <hi>Oſteology</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> and the better to compare it's <hi>Sceleton</hi> with that of a <hi>Man,</hi> and an <hi>Ape,</hi> and a <hi>Monkey,</hi> I thought I could not do better, than to inſert this Diſcourſe of <hi>Riolanus</hi>; and by <hi>Commenting</hi> upon it, to ſhew wherein our <hi>Pygmie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

This I thought the moſt compendious way, and what other Obſervations I have, that conveniently I can't inſert in my <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I ſhall add at the cloſe of this Diſcourſe. And tho' I may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſome for diſcourſing ſo largely upon an <hi>Ape,</hi> yet this <hi>Apology</hi> I have to make, That 'tis an Argument that has exerciſed the Pens of the greateſt <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> we have had; and ours being one of a higher degree than the Common ſort, and in ſo many Particulars nearer approaching the Structure of <hi>Man,</hi> than any of the <hi>Apekind,</hi> and it being ſo rare and uncommon, it may the more excuſe me, if I endeavour to be as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as I can.

(a) The <hi>Cranium</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was round and globous, and it ſeemed to be three times as big as the Head of a Common <hi>Monkey</hi>; for, that I might the better compare them, I procured the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> which I found was exactly the length or that of our <hi>Pygmie</hi>: though at the ſame time we ſhall ſee, that in ſeveral of the Parts, 'twas vaſtly different. For meaſuring the Head of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> by a Line drawn round from the Noſe, over the <hi>Orbit</hi> of the Eyes, to the <hi>Occiput</hi> or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Head, and ſo to the Noſe again, I obſerved 'twas Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Inches. The <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Monkey</hi> meaſured there only Nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and a quarter. The girth of the Head of the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tix</hi> round by the Ears to the <hi>Vertix</hi> again, was Eleven Inches and an half: in the <hi>Monkey</hi> 'twas only Seven Inches and an half. The longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> was Four Inches, of the <hi>Monkey</hi> Two Inches and a quarter. The latitudinal <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> was Three Inches and above a quarter; of the <hi>Monkey</hi> a little above Two Inches. The profundity of the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> from the <hi>Vertix</hi> to the <hi>Foramen</hi> where the <hi>Medulla Spinalis</hi> paſſes out, was about Three Inches and a quarter; in the <hi>Monkey</hi> Two Inches. So that in the largeneſs of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> the <hi>Pygmie</hi> much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>Monkey,</hi> as alſo <hi>Apes,</hi> and more reſembles a <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(b) The <hi>Sutures</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> perfectly reſembled thoſe in an <hi>Humane Cranium</hi>; The <hi>Sutura Coronalis Sagittalis,</hi> and <hi>Lambdoides</hi> being all <hi>ſerrated</hi> or <hi>indented</hi> very curiouſly, as in <hi>Man.</hi> In the <hi>Lambdoidal Suture</hi> I obſerved Nine <hi>Oſſa triquetra Wormiana.</hi> In the <hi>Cranium</hi> of a <hi>Monkey</hi> I found the <hi>Coronary Suture</hi> for the moſt part to be <hi>Harmonia,</hi> and only for a little ſpace to be <hi>ſerrated</hi> towards the middle, where it meets the <hi>Sagittal Suture.</hi> The <hi>Sagittal Suture</hi> here was indented throughout. The <hi>Lambdoidal Suture,</hi> as extended from the <hi>Sagittal</hi> of each ſide for about half an Inch, was <hi>ſerrated</hi>; then the <hi>Suture</hi> diſappeared, and there was formed here a riſing ridge of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> which was continued to that <hi>Apophyſis</hi> which makes the hinder part of the <hi>Os Zygomaticum.</hi> There was no ſuch bony ridge in the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie.</hi> In the <hi>Monkey</hi> too I ſaw the <hi>Squammous Sutures</hi> very plain, tho' <hi>Riolan</hi> denies them; which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was very apparent. Our <hi>Pygmie</hi> therefore in the Structure of the <hi>Sutures</hi> exactly reſembled a <hi>Humane Cranium,</hi> and more than <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi> do: For in them the <hi>Coronary</hi> and <hi>Lambdoidal Sutures</hi> were only in part <hi>ſerrated</hi>; and they had no <hi>Oſſa triquetra Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(c) In our <hi>Pygmie</hi> there was an <hi>Os Cribriforme,</hi> as in <hi>Man</hi>; 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an Inch long, and a quarter of an Inch broad; in it I num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred about Thirty <hi>Foramina</hi>; here was likewiſe that long ridge, (which is call'd <hi>Criſta Galli</hi>) as in a <hi>Man,</hi> to which the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> was faſtened.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62473:39"/>(d) In the <hi>Cranium</hi> of the <hi>Monkey</hi> there was no <hi>Criſta Galli</hi>; and where the <hi>Os Cribriforme</hi> ſhould have been, there was a hollow Paſſage which led towards the beginning of the Noſtrils, at the end of which there might be a ſmall <hi>Os Cribriforme</hi> perforated with four or five holes. But this Part appeared very different from the Structure of a <hi>Humane Skull,</hi> as likewiſe from our <hi>Pygmie</hi>; which was occaſioned chiefly by the great bunching in of the Bones of the Orbit of the Eye, tho' our <hi>Pygmie</hi> too had theſe Bones more protruded in, than they are in a <hi>Humane Cranium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(e) This appeared more in the <hi>Cranium</hi> of a <hi>Monkey</hi> than in our <hi>Pygmie</hi>; tho' here too 'twas ſomewhat more than in a <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>Skull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(f) The <hi>Sella Equina</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was exactly like a <hi>Man</hi>'s. In a <hi>Monkey</hi> I obſerved it more riſing and higher.

                     <p>(h) Theſe Cavities in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> were nothing ſo large as they are in a <hi>Monkey,</hi> but conformable to the Structure of this Part in an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Skull.</hi> And in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> too, I obſerved the <hi>Pterigoidal Proceſſes</hi> as they are in <hi>Man,</hi> but I did not find them in the <hi>Monkey.</hi>

                     <p>But as our <hi>Pygmie</hi> in the number of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> which compoſes the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> did imitate the <hi>Humane kind</hi>; ſo in other reſpects 'twas much liker to the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys</hi>: For the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> here, was nothing ſo dilated and ſpread, as 'tis in <hi>Man</hi>; but contracted and narrow as 'tis in <hi>Apes</hi>; and very remarkably different from the <hi>Humane Sceleton</hi>; as 'twas likewiſe in the <hi>Spines</hi> and <hi>Proceſſes</hi> which more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>Ape-kind.</hi>

                     <p>(o) In our <hi>Pygmie</hi> the <hi>Ribs</hi> were altogether as much curved, as in an <hi>Humane Sceleton</hi>; and it was as full <hi>cheſted</hi> as a <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(p) In the number of the <hi>Ribs</hi> our <hi>Pygmie</hi> imitated the <hi>Ape-kind</hi>: for it had thirteen of a ſide, ſix and twenty in all: In a <hi>Man</hi> there is but twenty four, tho' ſometimes there has been obſerved thirteen of a ſide.

But the eighth Bone <hi>Ingraſſias</hi> ſaith, is for the <hi>Cartilago Enſiformis.</hi> In the <hi>Sternum</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> I numbred ſeven Bones, the two laſt being ſmall and partly <hi>Cartilaginous</hi>; and here the <hi>Cartilages</hi> were inſerted at the Commiſſures and Joynings of the Bones of the <hi>Sternum.</hi> The <hi>Cartilago Enſiformis</hi> was long and roundiſh. The whole of the <hi>Sternum</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> much more reſembled the <hi>Humane Sceleton,</hi> than the <hi>Monkey</hi>'s, being much broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and larger, and as far as I obſerved juſt alike.</p>

narrower, and the <hi>Baſis</hi> was proportionably longer. But this I ſuppoſe might happen in preparing the <hi>Sceleton</hi> by paring away the <hi>Cartilages</hi> (for the Creature was young) which in a longer time would have hardened into a Bone. So likewiſe that <hi>Proceſs</hi> which receives the <hi>Clavicula</hi> call'd <hi>Acromion,</hi> was <hi>Cartilaginous,</hi> as was likewiſe the End of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſus Coracoides,</hi> and of the <hi>Cervix</hi> it ſelf, which laſt received the head of the <hi>Shoulder Bone.</hi> So that as yet there was not a <hi>Sinus</hi> formed here for the receiving it; but that Extream was flatter than uſually and plain; nor was there that <hi>Sinus</hi> under the <hi>Spine,</hi> as in an adult <hi>Humane Scapula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I obſerved no difference in the Figure and Structure of the <hi>Clavicula</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> and in a <hi>Man.</hi> Nor did I obſerve that Bone <hi>Riolan</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but a large <hi>Cartilage</hi> which did conjoyn that Extream of the <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> to the <hi>Acromium,</hi> which in time might become long; this <hi>Cartilage</hi> was about a quarter of an Inch long.</p>

                     <p>(a) There was no Part I think in the whole <hi>Sceleton</hi> where the <hi>Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> differed more from a <hi>Man,</hi> than in the Structure and Figure of the <hi>Os Ilium</hi>: for in a <hi>Humane Sceleton</hi> thoſe Bones are ſpread broad, forming a <hi>Sinus</hi> or Hollow on the Inſide. In the <hi>Pygmie</hi> they were proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably longer and narrower, and not ſo <hi>Concave</hi> on the inſide, but in all reſpects Conformable to the Shape of the ſame Bones in the <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey-kind.</hi> But why <hi>Riolan</hi> ſhould deny the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> to be in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys,</hi> I ſee no reaſon; for naturally there is not that <hi>Dehiſcence</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> as <hi>Coiter</hi> has given in his <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of a <hi>Monkey,</hi> and as he deſcribes it; from whence I ſuppoſe <hi>Riolan</hi> borrows this Deſcriprion: for in the <hi>Sceletons</hi> of two <hi>Monkeys</hi> I obſerved theſe Bones were joined together, and in the <hi>Pygmie</hi> they are cloſed as in a <hi>Man.</hi> When the <hi>Cartilage</hi> that joins them is divided, they will part
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62473:44"/>
aſunder; but otherwiſe they are firmly knit together. This therefore is no reaſon, why they ſhould not run faſt: and the contrary was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> that it did ſo.</p>
                     <p>The length of the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> from it's <hi>Spine</hi> to it's Conjunction with the <hi>Os Iſchium,</hi> was three Inches; where 'twas broadeſt, 'twas an Inch and half; where narroweſt, but three quarters of an Inch. The <hi>Os lſchium</hi> was an Inch and three quarters long; the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> was an Inch long.</p>
                     <p>(b) I did not obſerve any difference in the Structure of the <hi>Thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> from that in <hi>Man</hi>; nor was it's <hi>Articulation</hi> or Inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it's Head into the <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> more oblique than in <hi>Man.</hi> So that from this <hi>Articulation,</hi> I ſaw no reaſon why it ſhould not walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and ſit; our <hi>Pygmie</hi> did both: When I ſaw it, 'twas juſt a little before it's death; and tho' 'twas weak and feeble, it would ſtand, and go upright.</p>
                     <p>The length of the <hi>Thigh-bone</hi> in the <hi>Pygmie</hi> was five Inches: The girth of it in the middle an Inch and three quarters; where 'twas joined to the Bones of the <hi>Leg,</hi> 'twas an Inch and almoſt an half broad.</p>
                     <p>(c) The Neck of the Head of the <hi>Thigh-bone</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was not different in it's length, as I did obſerve, from that of a <hi>Man</hi>'s, but the ſame proportionably; as were likewiſe the two <hi>Apophyſes,</hi> called <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanteres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(d) The <hi>Patella</hi> in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was not yet <hi>oſſified.</hi> As much as I could diſcover of it's ſhape, it was the ſame as in <hi>Man</hi>; round and not long; and but one Bone, and not two, as <hi>Riolan</hi> deſcribes it in the <hi>Monkey.</hi> In the <hi>Sceletons</hi> of the <hi>Monkeys</hi> I uſed, theſe Bones were loſt, ſo that I did not obſerve them.</p>
                     <p>(e) The two Bones in the <hi>Leg,</hi> the <hi>Tibia</hi> and the <hi>Fibula</hi> were juſt the ſame in the <hi>Pygmie</hi> as in <hi>Man</hi>; and their Articulations were alike: The <hi>Tibia</hi> was four Inches long; the <hi>Fibula</hi> was a little ſhorter. The girth of the <hi>Tibia</hi> in the middle was about an Inch; of the <hi>Fibula,</hi> about half an Inch.</p>
                     <p>(f) What makes the <hi>foot</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> ſeem different from a <hi>Man</hi>'s, is chiefly the length of the <hi>Toes,</hi> and the Structure of the <hi>great Toe.</hi> In other reſpects, it has a great reſemblance with it. For the Bones of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> here, ſeemed proportionably as long as in <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Os Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Calcaneum</hi> or <hi>Heel-bone</hi> was not narrow, but broad; and forewards, where 'twas joined to the <hi>Os Cuboide</hi> or <hi>Cubiforme,</hi> not broader, nor lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than behind; where it juts out ſo far, as ſufficiently ſecures it's

ſtanding or walking erect. The <hi>Aſtragalus</hi> I did not obſerve different from a Man's. The <hi>Scaphoides</hi> or <hi>Naviculare</hi> here was <hi>Cartilaginous.</hi> If one reckons three Joints in the <hi>great Toe,</hi> then there can be but four Bones in the <hi>Planta Pedis,</hi> or <hi>Metatarſus</hi>; which with <hi>Euſtachius</hi> I am more inclined to, becauſe really this Part performs upon any occaſion the uſe of an <hi>Hand</hi> too; and the <hi>great Toe,</hi> (like the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi>) ſtands off from the range of the other Fingers. Beſides, I obſerved a difference in the Colour in the Bones of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> and the <hi>Toes</hi>: for the Colour of the <hi>Toes</hi> was white and opace; the Colour of the Bones of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> was like to that of the <hi>Cartilages,</hi> and more tranſparent. Now all the three Bones in the <hi>great Toe</hi> were of the ſame colour, white as were the other <hi>Toes.</hi> Therefore I ſhall make but four Bones in the <hi>Metatarſus,</hi> anſwerable to thoſe of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> in the <hi>Hand,</hi> and three Bones in the <hi>great Toe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(g) And as the <hi>Hand</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> in ſome Parts reſembled the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>; in others the <hi>Ape-kind</hi>: So the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Foot</hi> too. For the <hi>Heel,</hi> the <hi>Tarſus</hi> and <hi>Metatarſus</hi> were like to the <hi>Humane.</hi> But all the <hi>Toes</hi> were liker to the <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Monkey-kind</hi>: For the <hi>Toes</hi> here, if we may call them <hi>Toes,</hi> and not rather <hi>Fingers,</hi> were almoſt as long as the <hi>Fingers</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi>; much longer proportionably than in Man, and not lying ſo cloſe together: But the <hi>Bones</hi> of the <hi>Fingers</hi> in the <hi>Hand,</hi> were larger and bigger than thoſe of the <hi>Toes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(h) The <hi>great Toe</hi> in the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> was ſhorter than the firſt of the other Toes; tho' in a <hi>Man</hi> 'tis altogether as long; and herein it reſembles the <hi>Ape-kind.</hi> But whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (as I have remarked) mentions, that in <hi>Apes</hi> the <hi>middle Toe</hi> is the longeſt, as is the <hi>middle Finger</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi>; In the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> I did obſerve, that the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>middle Toe</hi> were both much of a length, each meaſuring an Inch and three quarters: The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>little Toe</hi> were about an Inch and an half long; the <hi>little Toe</hi> being rather ſomewhat ſhorter than the <hi>third Toe.</hi> If in the <hi>great Toe</hi> you reckon three <hi>Articuli,</hi> as <hi>Euſtachius</hi> does, then from the <hi>Tarſus</hi> to it's Extream, the <hi>great Toe</hi> meaſured two Inches and an half: but if with <hi>Coiter</hi> you make but two <hi>Articuli</hi> or <hi>Joints</hi> in the <hi>great Toe,</hi> and the other to be a Bone of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi>; theſe two were only an Inch and a quarter long: The four Bones of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> were much of a length, being about an Inch and a quarter long.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>great Toe</hi> (as has been already frequently remarked) being ſet off from the range of the others, more reſembles a <hi>Thumb.</hi> This Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I obſerve in it's make, That the Bones that compoſe it, are much bigger and larger, than any of the other <hi>Toes</hi>; and in reſpect of the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the <hi>Hand,</hi> vaſtly bigger. In the <hi>Sceletou</hi> of a <hi>Monkey</hi> I did not obſerve the Bones of the <hi>great Toe,</hi> to exceed thoſe of the other. But as the <hi>Thumb</hi> in the <hi>Foot</hi> is much bigger, than that in the <hi>Hand</hi>; ſo the <hi>Fingers</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi> are much larger than thoſe in the <hi>Foot.</hi>

                     <p>IN Homine <hi>Oſſa Seſamoidea</hi> pauca ſunt, magnaque ex parte cartilagino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, &amp; ſi ea quae pollici applicantur exceperis, in conſtanti ſede firmata.

Duo oſſicula magnitudine ciceris, ſupra utrumque tuberculum femoris in origine gemellorum reperiuntur.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Oſſa Seſamoidea</hi> in our Subject, I have very little to ſay: For it being young, very likely they might be only <hi>Cartilaginous,</hi> and the Skin adhering ſo firmly here, they might be taken off with it. Since they are in <hi>Apes,</hi> I do not doubt, but that they were in our <hi>Pygmie</hi> too, tho' I did not obſerve them.</p>
                     <p>Having now made my Remarks upon the <hi>Compariſon,</hi> that <hi>Riolan,</hi> or rather <hi>Euſtachius</hi> and <hi>Coiter,</hi> have given us, between the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> an <hi>Ape,</hi> and a <hi>Monkey</hi>; and ſhewn wherein the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of our <hi>Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> either agreed or diſagreed from any of them, I ſhall make ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the whole; and more particularly upon ſome Parts, which deſerve here a more diſtinct Conſideration. But ſhall firſt of all take the Dimenſions of the <hi>Sceleton,</hi> and of ſome other Parts I have not mentioned already.</p>
                     <p>As from the top of the <hi>Cranium</hi> to the Extream of the <hi>Heel</hi> in a ſtrait Line, the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of the <hi>Pygmie</hi> meaſured about two Foot; from the firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the <hi>Neck</hi> to the laſt of the <hi>Os Coccygis,</hi> eleven Inches; from the head of the <hi>Shoulder-bone,</hi> to the end of the <hi>middle Finger,</hi> 'twas about fifteen Inches; the end of this <hi>Finger</hi> reaching in an erect Poſture an Inch and half below the <hi>Patella</hi>: whereas in an <hi>Humane Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton,</hi> from the end of the <hi>middle Finger</hi> to the lower part of the <hi>Patel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> it wanted five Inches and an half: Our <hi>Pygmie</hi> therefore herein imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the <hi>Ape-kind.</hi> From the head of the <hi>Thigh-bone,</hi> to the bottom of the <hi>Os Calcis</hi> in the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> was about ten Inches. From the ſetting on of the firſt <hi>Rib,</hi> to the faſtening on of the laſt, was four Inches. The diſtance between the laſt <hi>Rib,</hi> and the <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> not full two Inches. From the <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> to the bottom of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> in a ſtrait Line, was four Inches and three quarters. The diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the end of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Os Ilium</hi> about three Inches.

                     <p>The <hi>Sceleton</hi> of our <hi>Pygmie</hi> was juſt the ſame length of one of a <hi>Monkeys</hi> that I borrowed: But becauſe I obſerved moſt of the <hi>Apophyſes</hi> of the Bones to be <hi>Cartilaginous</hi> in the <hi>Pygmie,</hi> I muſt conclude, that 'twas but young; and that probably it might grow taller; to what height I am uncertain. Yet I can by no means be induced to believe, that it would ever arrive to the Stature of a <hi>Man,</hi> as ſome ſort of this <hi>Species</hi> of Animals has been obſerved to do; for then I could not expect to have ſeen here, the <hi>Bones</hi> themſelves ſo ſolid, or the <hi>Cranium</hi> to be ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oſſiſied, or the <hi>Sutures</hi> to be ſo cloſed and indented, and the <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> and <hi>Ribs</hi> ſo fully hardened, as all the Bones of the <hi>Artus</hi> or <hi>Limbs</hi> were likewiſe, except at their <hi>Apophyſes,</hi> and in the <hi>Carpus</hi> and <hi>Tarſus.</hi> Now all theſe Parts that had theſe <hi>Cartilaginous Apophyſes,</hi> had already acquired ſo great a length, in proportion to the reſt of the <hi>Body,</hi> that 'tis not to be imagined, that they would have exceeded it, or at leaſt not much; and conſidering that <hi>Animals</hi> come to their <gap reason="foreign">

I could have wiſhed that thoſe that have wrote of any of this <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> had given us their Dimenſions and Ages; but they are ſilent herein, or at leaſt too general: only <hi>Le Compte</hi> observed an <hi>Ape</hi> in the Straits of <hi>Molucca</hi> four foot high; but this may not be our ſort. As to thoſe of <hi>Borneo,</hi> I was informed by a Sea-Captain who uſed thoſe Parts, that the King there formerly had one as tall as a <hi>Man,</hi> that would frequently come down to the Town, and a great many Stories are told of him. The ſame Captain had two given him, both young, and about the height of our <hi>Pygmie</hi>; but theſe were not hairy, but naked as a <hi>Man</hi>; and one of them that he carried to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia,</hi> was looked upon as ſo great a Rarity, that all the time he ſtaid there, his Ship was conſtantly viſited by ſuch as came to ſee it. But 'tis Master of Fact, not Reaſoning, that will beſt determine this doubt, and a faithful Obſervation that muſt inform us, to what tallneſs this ſort of <hi>Animal</hi> in <hi>Angola,</hi> and the Countries thereabout, does uſually grow; for in different Countries they may be different in this reſpect, tho' the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> as is ſeen even in <hi>Mankind.</hi>

And if ſo, and our <hi>Ape</hi> be found not much to exceed the meaſures given, I ſhall think my Conjecture in giving this Name, not amiſs. But of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And to proceed:</p>
                     <p>Since the <hi>Bones</hi> are the main Timber-work in this Fabrick of <hi>Animal</hi> Bodies, by which the whole is ſupported, and upon their Structure, in a good meaſure, does depend their manner of <hi>local motion,</hi> we will here more particularly enquire, which may be thought the moſt natural way of walking in our <hi>Pygmie,</hi> either as a <hi>Quadruped</hi> or a <hi>Biped,</hi> for it did both upon occaſion; and we will ſee whether by Nature 'twas equally provided for the doing both.</p>
                     <p>Now when I obſerved it to go upon all four, as a <hi>Quadruped</hi> (as has been already remark'd) it did not place the <hi>Palms</hi> of the <hi>Hands</hi> flat to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62473:48"/>
the Ground, but went upon it's Knuckles, or rather upon the firſt Joints of the Fingers of the Fore-hands, the ſecond and third Joints being bended or touching the Ground; which ſeem'd to me ſo unuſual a way of <hi>walking,</hi> as I have not obſerved the like before in any <hi>Animal.</hi> And I did expect it the leſs here: becauſe the Fore-limbs being ſo very long, it might be thought, that it had the leſs need of thus raiſing the Body. And the whole weight of the Body thus lying upon theſe Joints of the <hi>Fingers,</hi> one would think, that they ſhould be ſoon tired in ſupporting it, and that <hi>Nature</hi> did not deſign it for a Conſtancy, but only upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, or a preſent ſhift: For if it was to be it's uſual way of walking, no doubt, for it's greater eaſe, it would place the <hi>Palms</hi> flat to the Ground, as all other <hi>Animals</hi> do the <hi>ſole</hi> of the <hi>Foot,</hi> and hereby it would be rendered better able to bear this weight.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, when it walks thus upon it's <hi>Fingers,</hi> the <hi>flexure</hi> at the Elbow will be inwards, towards the ſides of the Body, which is different from all other <hi>Quadrupeds,</hi> and in it's Progreſſion will be of no uſe at all, nay, will be an hinderance to it; and it will require a great tention of the <hi>Muſcles</hi> to keep theſe <hi>Fore-limbs</hi> ſtrait; and if they are not kept ſo, they muſt halt, and can't move ſwiftly; which makes me diffident, that this can't be it's Natural Poſture in going; for Nature always contrives the eaſieſt and beſt ways of <hi>Motion.</hi> Now in <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> the flection of the fore and hinder Limbs, is both the ſame way: But in a <hi>Man</hi> and an <hi>Ape</hi> (as I have before remarked from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) 'tis contrary; or as <hi>Pliny</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Homini genua &amp; Cubita contraria, item <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſis &amp; Simia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum generi, ob id minimè pernicibus.</hi> But how <hi>Pliny</hi> comes to bring in the <hi>Bear</hi> here, I do not underſtand: for if with the <hi>Pariſians</hi> 
                        <note n="(93)" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Their Anatomic Deſcription of a Bear in their Memoirs,</hi> p. m. 44.</note> we ſhould here underſtand by <hi>Genua,</hi> the <hi>Heel-bone,</hi> and by <hi>Cubita</hi> a Bone of the <hi>Carpus</hi> (which are often longer in <hi>Brutes</hi> than in <hi>Man</hi>) then this will be a Property not peculiar to <hi>Bears,</hi> but might be obſerved in other <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> too. I ſhould rather own it as a Miſtake in <hi>Pliny.</hi> Nor can I aſſent to the <hi>Pariſians, That all Animals have theſe Parts turned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame, manner, whatever</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>may report thereof.</hi> I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am of <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> mind, and any Body may experience it in himſelf, and obſerve the <hi>flexure</hi> of the <hi>Cubit</hi> to be different from that of the <hi>Knee</hi>; and where 'tis ſo, there the Motion upon all four, will be very awkward and unnatural, and as <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves, it can't be ſwift.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here further obſerve, that in <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> the make of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> the ſetting on of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and the <hi>Articulation</hi> of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> or Shoulder-bone, are much different from what they are in <hi>Bipeds.</hi>: for <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> are narrow Cheſted, and their <hi>Thorax</hi> not ſo round as in a <hi>Man,</hi> becauſe in them the <hi>Scapulae</hi> are to be placed more forward upon the Ribs, and not ſo backwards as in <hi>Men.</hi> And the Articulation or the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62473:48"/>
Shoulder with the <hi>Scapula</hi> in <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> lies nearer the <hi>Ribs</hi>; in <hi>Man</hi> 'tis extended farther from them. Now our <hi>Pygmie</hi> ſo exàctly imitating <hi>Humane-kind</hi> in all theſe Circumſtances, makes me think that <hi>Nature</hi> did not deſign it a <hi>Quadruped,</hi> but a <hi>Biped.</hi> For it had a full round <hi>Chest</hi> or <hi>Thorax,</hi> and it's <hi>Scapulae</hi> placed backwards, not ſo forwards on the <hi>Ribs,</hi> and the Articulation of the <hi>Shoulder</hi> with the <hi>Scapula,</hi> ſtood off from the <hi>Ribs</hi> as it do's in <hi>Man.</hi> And from this very Conſideration <hi>Galen</hi>

                  <p>HAVING had the Opportunity of Diſſecting this remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature, which not only in the <hi>outward ſhape</hi> of the Body, but likewiſe in the ſtructure of many of the Inward Parts, ſo nearly reſembles a <hi>Man,</hi> as plainly appears by the <hi>Anatomy</hi> I have here given of it, it ſuggeſted the Thought to me, whether this ſort of <hi>Animal,</hi> might not give the Foundation to the Stories of the <hi>Pygmies</hi>? and aſtord an occaſion not only to the <hi>Poets,</hi> but <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> too, of inventing the many <hi>Fables</hi> and wonderful and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Relations, that are tranſmitted down to us concerning them? I muſt conſeſs, I could never before entertain any other Opinion about them, but that the whole was a <hi>Fiction</hi>: and as the firſt Account we have of them, was from a <hi>Poet,</hi> ſo that they were only a Creature of the Brain, produced by a warm and wanton Imagination, and that they never had any Exiſtence or Habitation elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>In this Opinion I was the more confirmed, becauſe the moſt diligent Enquiries of late into all the Parts of the inhabited World, could never diſcover any ſuch <hi>Puny</hi> diminutive <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi> That they ſhould be totally deſtroyed by the <hi>Cranes,</hi> their Enemies, and not a Straggler here and there left remaining, was a Fate, that even thoſe <hi>Animals</hi> that are conſtantly preyed upon by others, never undergo.

                  <p>This Opinion had ſo fully obtained with me, that I never thought it worth the Enquiry, how they came to invent ſuch Extravagant Stories: Nor ſhould I now, but upon the Occaſion of Diſſecting this <hi>Animal</hi>: For obſerving that 'tis call'd even to this day in the <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Malabar</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Orang-Outang, i.e.</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> of the <hi>Woods,</hi> or <hi>Wild-men</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought from <hi>Africa,</hi> that part of the World, where the <hi>Pygmies</hi> are ſaid to inhabit; and it's preſent <hi>Stature</hi> likewiſe tallying ſo well with that of the <hi>Pygmies</hi> of the Ancients; theſe Conſiderations put me upon the ſearch, to inform my ſelf farther about them, and to examine, whether I could meet with any thing that might illuſtrate their <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> For I thought it ſtrange, that if the whole was but a meer Fiction, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſucceeding Generations ſhould be ſo fond of preſerving a <hi>Story,</hi> that had no Foundation at all in Nature; and that the <hi>Ancients</hi> ſhould trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves ſo much about them.

                  <p>My Deſign is not to juſtifie all the Relations that have been given of this <hi>Animal,</hi> even by Authors of reputed Credit; but, as far as I can, to diſtinguiſh Truth from Fable; and herein, if what I aſſert amounts to a Probability, 'tis all I pretend to.

                     <p>In the middle of <hi>India</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cteſias</hi>) there are black Men, they are call'd <hi>Pygmies,</hi> uſing the ſame Language, as the other <hi>Indians</hi>; they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62473:73"/>
are very little, the talleſt of them being but two Cubits, and moſt of them but a Cubit and a half high. They have very long hair, reaching down to their Knees and lower; and a Beard larger than any Man's. After their Beards are grown long, they wear no Cloaths, but the Hair of their Head falls behind a great deal below their Hams; and that of their Beards before comes down to their Feet: then laying their Hair thick all about their Body, they afterwards gird themſelves, making uſe of their Hair for Cloaths. They have a <hi>Penis</hi> ſo long, that it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Ancle, and the thickneſs is proportionable. They are flat noſed, and ill favoured. Their Sheep are like Lambs; and their Oxen and Aſſes ſcarce as big as Rams; and their Horſes and Mules, and all their other Cattle nor bigger. Three thouſand Men of theſe <hi>Pygmies</hi> do attend the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>India.</hi> They are good <hi>Archers</hi>; they are very juſt, and uſe the ſame <hi>Laws</hi> as the <hi>Indians</hi> do.

                  <p>Well, if they are ſo good Sports-men, as to kill Hares and Foxes with Ravens, Kites, Crows and Eagles, I can't ſee how I can bring off <hi>Homer,</hi> for making them fight the <hi>Cranes</hi> themſelves. Why did they not fly their <hi>Eagles</hi> againſt them? theſe would make greater Slaughter and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, without hazarding themſelves.

                  <p>I had almoſt forgotten <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> whom <hi>Bartholine</hi> mentions in the cloſe of this Chapter, but lays no great ſtreſs upon his Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he tells us, he is fabulous in a great many other Relations, and he writes but by hear-ſay, that the <hi>Greenlanders</hi> fight the <hi>Cranes; Tandem</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bartholine) neque ideo Pygmaei ſunt, ſi fortè ſagittis &amp; haſtis, ſicut alij homines, Grues conficiunt &amp; occidunt.</hi> This I think is great Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: For <hi>Cteſias,</hi> an Author whom upon all turns <hi>Bartholine</hi> makes uſe of as an Evidence, is very poſitive, that the <hi>Pygmies</hi> were excellent <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>: ſo that he himſelf owns, that their being ſuch, illuſtrates very much that <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> on which he ſpends good part of the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> whoſe Title is, <hi>Pygmaeorum Gens ex Ezekiele, atque rationibus probabilibus adſtruitur</hi>; which we will conſider by and by. And tho' <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> may write ſome things by hear-ſay, yet he cannot be ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous as <hi>Cteſias,</hi> who (as <hi>Lucian</hi> tells us) writes what he neither ſaw himſelf, or heard from any Body elſe. Not that I think <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> his <hi>Greenlanders</hi> were real <hi>Pygmies,</hi> no more than <hi>Cteſias</hi> his <hi>Pygmies</hi> were real <hi>Men</hi>; tho' he vouches very notably for them.

                  <p>Having now conſidered and examined the various Opinions of theſe learned Men concerning this <hi>Pygmaeomachia</hi>; and repreſented the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they give for maintaining their Conjectures; I ſhall beg leave to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn my own: and if what at preſent I offer, may ſeem more probable, or account for this Story with more likelyhood, than what hath hitherto been advanced, I ſhall not think my time altogether miſpent: But if this will not do, I ſhall never trouble my head more about them, nor think my ſelf any ways concerned to write on this Argument again. And I had not done it now, but upon the occaſion of Diſſecting this <hi>Orang-Outang,</hi> or <hi>wild Man,</hi> which being a Native of <hi>Africa,</hi> and brought from <hi>Angola,</hi> tho' firſt taken higher up in the Country, as I was informed by the Relation given me; and obſerving ſo great a Reſemblance, both in the outward ſhape, and, what ſurprized me more, in the Structure likewiſe of the inward Parts, to a <hi>Man</hi>; this Thought was eaſily ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to me, That very probably this <hi>Animal,</hi> or ſome other ſuch of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> might give the firſt riſe and occaſion to the Stories of the <hi>Pygmies.</hi> What has been the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and rendered this Story ſo difficult to be believed, I find hath been the Opinion that has generally
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62473:85"/>
obtained, that theſe <hi>Pygmies</hi> were really a Race of <hi>little Men.</hi> And tho' they are only <hi>Brutes,</hi> yet being at firſt call'd <hi>wild Men,</hi> no doubt from the Reſemblance they bear to <hi>Men</hi>; there have not been wanting thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt the Ancients, who have invented a hundred ridiculous Stories concerning them; and have attributed thoſe things to them, were they to be believed in what they ſay, that neceſſarily conclude them real <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſum up therefore what I have already diſcourſed, I think I have proved, that the <hi>Pygmies</hi> were not an <hi>Humane Species</hi> or <hi>Men.</hi> And tho' <hi>Homer,</hi> who firſt mentioned them, calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet we need not underſtand by this Expreſſion any thing more than <hi>Apes</hi>: And tho' his <hi>Geranomachia</hi> hath been look'd upon by moſt only as a Poetical Fiction; yet by aſſigning what might be the true Cauſe of this Quarrel between the <hi>Cranes</hi> and <hi>Pygmies,</hi> and by diveſting it of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fabulous Relations that the <hi>Indian Hiſtorians,</hi> and others, have load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with, I have endeavoured to render it a true, at leaſt a probable Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I have inſtanced in <hi>Cteſias</hi> and the <hi>Indian Hiſtorians,</hi> as the Authors and Inventors of the many Fables we have had concerning thém: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, I have Examined thoſe Relations; where Speech or Language is attributed to them; and ſhewn, that there is no reaſon to believe, that they ever ſpake any Language at all. But theſe <hi>Indian Hiſtorians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving related ſo many extravagant Romances of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> as to render their whole Hiſtory ſuſpected, nay to be utterly denied, that there were ever any ſuch Creatures as <hi>Pygmies</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> both by <hi>Strabo</hi> of old, and moſt of our Learned Men of late, I have endeavoured to aſſert the Truth of their <hi>being,</hi> from a <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; which being ſo poſitive in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their Exiſtence, creates a difficulty, that can no ways be got over by ſuch as are of the contrary Opinion. This <hi>Text</hi> I have vindicated from the falſe Interpretations and Gloſſes of ſeveral Great Men, who had their Minds ſo prepoſſeſſed and prejudiced with the Notion of <hi>Men Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> that they often would quote it, and miſapply it, tho' it contain'd nothing that any ways favoured their Opinion; but the contrary rather, that they were <hi>Brutes,</hi> and not <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the <hi>Pygmies</hi> were really <hi>Brutes,</hi> I think I have plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> who reckon them amongſt the <hi>wild Beaſts</hi> that breed in thoſe Countries: For tho' by <hi>Herodotus</hi> they are call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet both make them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>wild Beaſts.</hi> And I might here add what <hi>Pauſanias</hi> 
                     <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Pauſanias in Atticis, <hi>p. m.</hi> 21.</note> relates from <hi>Euphemus Car,</hi> who by contrary Winds was driven upon ſome Iſlands, where he tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but when he comes to deſcribe them, tells us that they had no Speech;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62473:85"/>
that they had Tails on their Rumps; and were very laſcivious toward the Women in the Ship. But of theſe more, when we come to diſcourſe of <hi>Satyrs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we may the leſs wonder to find that they call <hi>Brutes Men,</hi> ſince 'twas common for theſe <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> to give the Title of <hi>Men,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Brutes,</hi> but they were grown ſo wanton in their Inventions, as to deſcribe ſeveral Nations of <hi>Monſtrous Men,</hi> that had never any Being, but in their own Imagination, as I have inſtanced in ſeveral. I therefore excuſe <hi>Strabo</hi> for denying the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> ſince he could not but be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, they could not be ſuch <hi>Men,</hi> as theſe <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> have deſcribed them. And the better to judge of the Reaſons that ſome of the Moderns have given to prove the Being of <hi>Men Pygmies,</hi> I have laid down as <hi>Poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's,</hi> that hereby we muſt not underſtand <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> nor yet a Nation of <hi>Men,</hi> tho' ſomewhat of a leſſer ſize and ſtature than ordinary; but we muſt obſerve thoſe two Characteriſticks that <hi>Homer</hi> gives of them, that they are <hi>Cubitales,</hi> and fight <hi>Cranes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having premiſed this, I have taken into conſideration <hi>Caſpar Bartholine Senior</hi> his <hi>Opuſculum de Pygmaeis,</hi> and <hi>Jo. Talentonius's</hi> Diſſertation about them; and upon examination do find, that neither the Humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, nor Divine that they alledge, do any ways prove, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the Being of <hi>Men Pygmies.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who is likewiſe quoted on their ſide, is ſo far from favouring this Opinion, that he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ſuch Creatures exiſt, and if they do, concludes them to be <hi>Apes</hi> or <hi>Monkeys</hi>; and cenſures thoſe <hi>Indian Hiſtorians</hi> for impoſing ſuch Beaſts upon us, as diſtinct Races of <hi>Men. Julius Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon,</hi> and <hi>Adrian Spigelius</hi> utterly deny the Being of <hi>Pygmies,</hi> and look upon them as a Figment only of the Ancients, becauſe ſuch little Men as they deſcribe them to be, are no where to be met with in all the World. The Learned <hi>Bochartus,</hi> tho' he eſteems the <hi>Geranomachia</hi> to be a Fable, and ſlights it, yet thinks that what might give the occaſion to the Story of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> might be the <hi>Nubae</hi> or <hi>Nobae,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> conjectures that it was thoſe <hi>Dwarfs</hi> beyond the Fountains of the <hi>Nile,</hi> that <hi>Dapper</hi> calls the <hi>Mimos,</hi> and tells us, they kill <hi>Elephants</hi> for to make a Traffick with their Teeth. But <hi>Job Ludolphus</hi> alters the Scene, and inſtead of <hi>Cranes,</hi> ſubſtitutes his <hi>Condors,</hi> who do not fight the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> but fly away with them, and then devour them.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe Conjectures do no ways account for <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Pygmies</hi> and <hi>Cranes,</hi> they are too much forced and ſtrain'd. Truth is always eaſie and plain. In our preſent Caſe therefore I think the <hi>Orang-Outang,</hi> or <hi>wild Man,</hi> may exactly ſupply the place of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> and without any violence or injury to the Story, ſufficiently account for the whole Hiſtory of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> but what is moſt apparently fabulous; for what has been the greateſt difficulty to be ſolved or ſatisfied, was their being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62473:86"/>
                     <hi>Men</hi>; for as <hi>Geſner</hi> remarks (as I have already quoted him) <hi>Sed vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nullus aliter de Pygmaeis ſcripſit, quàm Homunciones eſſe.</hi> And the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns too, being byaſſed and miſguided by this Notion, have either wholly denied them, or contented themſelves in offering their Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures what might give the firſt riſe to the inventing this Fable. And tho' <hi>Albertus,</hi> as I find him frequently quoted, thought that the <hi>Pygmies</hi> might be only a ſort of <hi>Apes,</hi> and he is placed in the Head of thoſe that eſpouſed this Opinion, yet he ſpoils all, by his way of reaſoning, and by making them ſpeak; which was more than he needed to do.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſee therefore any thing that will ſo fairly ſolve this doubt, that will reconcile all, that will ſo eaſily and plainly make out this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as by making the <hi>Qrang-Outang</hi> to be the <hi>Pygmie</hi> of the Ancients; for 'tis the ſame Name that Antiquity gave them. For <hi>Herodotus's</hi>

Becauſe this ſort of <hi>Apes</hi> had ſo great a reſemblance to Men, more than other <hi>Apes</hi> or <hi>Monkeys</hi>; and they going naturally erect, and being deſigned by Nature to go ſo, (as I have ſhewn in the <hi>Anatomy</hi>) the Ancients had a very plauſible ground for giving them this denomination of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or ſome ſnch like. Now the Ancient <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Indian Hiſtorians,</hi> tho' they might know theſe <hi>Pygmies</hi> to be only <hi>Apes</hi> like <hi>Men,</hi> and not to be real <hi>Men,</hi> yet being ſo extreamly addicted to <hi>Mythology,</hi> or making Fables, and finding this ſo fit a Subject to engraft upon, and invent Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about, they have not been wanting in furniſhing us with a great many very Romantick ones on this occaſion.

                  <p>This difficulty therefore of their being called <hi>Men,</hi> I think, may fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough be accounted for by what I have ſaid.

                     <hi>That both they and the Horſes there are but ſmall.</hi> He does not ſay <hi>their</hi> Horſes, for they were never mounted upon <hi>Horſes,</hi> but only upon <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, Goats</hi> and <hi>Rams.</hi> And as the <hi>Horſes,</hi> and other <hi>Beaſts</hi> are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally leſs in <hi>Africa</hi> than in other Parts, ſo likewiſe may the <hi>Orang-Outang</hi> be. This that I diſſected, which was brought from <hi>Angola</hi> (as I have often mentioned) wanted ſomething of the juſt ſtature of the <hi>Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>; but it was young, and I am therefore uncertain to what tallneſs it might grow, when at full Age: And neither <hi>Tulpius,</hi> nor <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> nor any that I have hitherto met with, have adjuſted the full ſtature of this <hi>Animal</hi> that is found in thoſe Parts from whence ours was brought: But 'tis moſt certain, that there are ſorts of <hi>Apes</hi> that are much leſs than the <hi>Pygmies</hi> are deſcribed to be.

                  <p>As to our <hi>Ape Pygmies</hi> or <hi>Orang-Outang</hi> fighting the <hi>Cranes,</hi> this, I think, may be eaſily enough made out, by what I have already obſerved; for this <hi>wild Man</hi> I diſſected was <hi>Carnivorous,</hi> and it may be <hi>Omnivorous,</hi> at leaſt as much as <hi>Man</hi> is; for it would eat any thing that was brought to the Table. And if it was not their Hunger that drove them to it, their Wantonneſs, it may be, would make them apt enough to rob the <hi>Cranes</hi> Neſts; and if they did ſo, no doubt but the <hi>Cranes</hi> would make noiſe enough about it, and endeavour what they could to beat them off, which a Poet might eaſily make a Fight: Tho' <hi>Homer</hi> only makes uſe of it, as a <hi>Simile,</hi> in comparing the great Shouts of the <hi>Trojans</hi> to the Noiſe of the <hi>Cranes,</hi> and the Silence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> to that of the <hi>Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> when they are going to Engage, which is natural enough, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt, and contains nothing, but what may eaſily be believed; tho'

They have Teeth larger than Dogs; and Nails like Dogs, but longer and rounder. They dwell up in the Mountains, as far as the River <hi>Indus</hi>; they are black and very juſt, as are the other <hi>Indians</hi> with whom they are mixt; and they underſtand what is ſaid to them, tho' they cannot ſpeak themſelves.

They breed a great many Sheep, Goats and Aſſes; and drink the Milk and Butter-milk of the Sheep. They eat likewiſe the Fruit of the <hi>Sipachora</hi> Tree, from whence comes <hi>Ambar,</hi> the Fruit whereof is ſweet, which having dried, they put up in Baskets, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do <hi>Raiſins.</hi> Theſe <hi>Cynocephali</hi> having made a Boat, they load it with this Fruit, and with <hi>Purpura,</hi> the Flower being firſt picked, and with <hi>Ambar,</hi> to the quantity of Two hundred and ſixty Talents, which they every Year ſhip off, and as much too of the Drug, with which the Dyers dye the Scarlet; and they carry every Year a Thouſand Talents of <hi>Ambar</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> and they take with them other Commodities, which they ſell to the <hi>Indians</hi>; for which they receive Bread, and Meal, and Cotton Garments. And the <hi>Indians</hi> ſell them likewiſe Swords, which they uſe in taking the wild Beaſts; and Bows and Darts, for they are very skilful Archers and Darters. They are invincible, becauſe they inhabit very high, and inacceſſible Mountains. Every fifth year, the King beſtows upon them Three hundred thouſand Bows, and as many Darts: Alſo an Hundred and twenty thouſand Shields, and Fifty thouſand Swords. They have no Houſes, but live in Caves. In hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wild Beaſts, they uſe their Bows and Darts, and purſuing them, they take them; for they run very ſwift. The Women bathe only once a Month, when they have their <hi>Catamenia,</hi> otherwiſe not.

Yet we find <hi>AElian, Pliny, Solinus,</hi> and a great many others have done it; tho' they have added by it little Credit to their Hiſtories, and no doubt much leſſened their own Reputation by tranſcribing the Errors of their Predeceſſors. In the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> therefore of <hi>Nature</hi> we muſt not depend upon the Authority of the Number of thoſe that only tranſcribe the ſame thing, without duly examining the Matter themſelves: For the Authority here wholly depends on the veracity of the firſt Relator: And it what <hi>Cteſias</hi> ſaith is falſe, tho' never ſo many ſay the ſame thing from him, they muſt all be in the wrong. Eſpecially in tranſcribing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and believing their Reports, we ought to be very cautious, ſince 'twas a common Practice amongſt them to diſguiſe and conceal the Truths they would deliver, in <hi>AEnigmatical</hi> and <hi>Mythological</hi> Repreſentations. Many times there is ſomething of Truth contained in their Relations, but 'tis under ſuch Vails, that you will not diſcover it, till you have taken them off.

ſuch Animals in <hi>Africa</hi> which the Ancients called <hi>Satyrs.</hi> And tho' they ſometimes called them <hi>Men,</hi> and for the moſt part worſhipped them as <hi>Gods,</hi> yet I ſhall ſhew, that they were only a ſort of <hi>Monkeys,</hi> and likewiſe Evince, that the <hi>Orang-Outang</hi> was not this ſort of <hi>Monkey</hi> or <hi>Satyr</hi> of the Ancients.</p>
