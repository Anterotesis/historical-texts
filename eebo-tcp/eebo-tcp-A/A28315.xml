         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Introductory Preface TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAveing formerly ſpent ſome of my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful years in the Study of <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and ſince that, in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and the practice of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and finding by good experience how each part doth depend upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for without ſome knowledge in <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> one can be no <hi>Aſtrologer</hi>; and without knowledge in <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> one can be no <hi>Philoſopher</hi>; and without Knowledg both in <hi>Aſtrology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> one can be no good <hi>Phyſitian</hi>: and whoſoever deſireth to make practice, either in the <hi>Aſtrological</hi> or <hi>Chymical</hi> way of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick (as for the Drug way, there can be no certainty in careing thereby, as will plainly appear in this book) having laid his foundation as aforeſaid (which if any Practitioner or Student in Phyſick be ignorant of, this Book will ſufficiently inſtruct them therein) muſt build and rely upon theſe five ſubſtantial Pillars following, without which, there can be no admirable cures done, or wonders wrought in this noble Art of Phyſick, <hi>Viz.</hi> Time, Vertue, Number, Sympathy, and Antipathy. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Time is of great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:48251:10"/>
whereby to gather each Herb or Plant at the right Planetary hours, which this book will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inform you; and likewiſe to know the hour and time when to adminiſter your Phyſick aright, for if the Phyſick be adminiſtred at a wrong hour, be it Purge or Vomit it will work contrary effects, as I have oft times proved: <hi>Example,</hi> If you give a Purge when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in an Earthy Sign, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by a Planet Retrograde, and that the Aſcendant with its Lord doth Correſpond, then the Purge will turn unto a Vomit: and on the contrary, if a Vomit be given when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in a Watery Sign, Aſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Planets ſwift in Motion out of Watery Signs, the Signs Aſcending with its Lord Correſponding, then the Vomit will turn to a Purge: alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act time muſt be obtained whereby to erect your Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure aright, whereby to give judgment upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, its cauſe and termination, which this book will ſufficiently inſtruct you in. For by Urine alone, no true judgement herein can be given, except in ſome few infirmities which proceed from the blood, or paſſages of Urine, for Urine is but the excrement of blood: there are many other conſiderations to be made uſe of by vertue of time, which I for brevities ſake am willing at preſent to paſs over, and ſo ſhall proceed unto the word Vertue, which is in brief, a right knowledge and underſtanding of the Nature, Properties, Elemental Qualities and Effects which each Herb or Plant hath, whereby to cure all kinds of griefs or infirmities whatſoever, either by Sympathy or Antipathy, as this book will ſufficiently inform you; and all growing within our Nation. I ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf or Reader in ſetting forth the dangers in uſing Forrain Drugs, yet I deny not, but that ſome
<pb facs="tcp:48251:10"/>
Drugs, whoſe vertue and operations are well known unto us may in many reſpects be uſeful, by reaſon our Climate doth not afford ſome ingredients which are neceſſary to be uſed in ſome Diſtempers, as Figs, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Currants, Sugar, Wine, and Spirits. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are oft times made uſe of, whereby to make our Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-drinks and ſpirits of Plants extracted the more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, and doth help to work a more forceble effect in many diſtempers, as you will find in this book: and I have accordingly in ſome infirmities made uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, concerning <hi>Number</hi>: there are certain Numbers attributed unto the Planets, which every Aſtrological or Chymical Phyſician ought to know; more eſpecially, ſuch who uſe this way of cure by Herbs or Plants which is the moſt aſſured way extant as beſt agreeing with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> bodies, yet as I have already declared both in Decoctions, and in Chimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Extractions, Ingredients, together with Herbs may be uſed to make it the more forceable and ſavory; but ſhould we take all Herbs or Plants which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted good for every grief, not having regard to any ſelect Number, there being ſo many ſorts of Herbs approved good for the ſame, there would be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty either for the gathering of the Herbs at a right hour, or yet know when you have enough whereby to work your cure: the certainty of a ſelect Number is not only according unto my own experience, but alſo its the Opinion of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> an excellent Philoſopher, and many others: What Numbers are attributed unto each Planet, and the reaſons thereof, I have elſewhere in this book expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Concerning <hi>Sympathy,</hi> that is, when any Planet who is ſtrongeſt in the Heavens by eſſential
<pb facs="tcp:48251:11"/>
dignities, ſhall afflict the Principal ſignificator of the ſick: eſpecially, if more ſtrong than that Planet which is of a contrary nature; then thoſe herbs or Plants which are under his Dominion, ſhall according unto their Vertues and Numbers be collected to cure the infirmity, alwayes provided, they are gathered at the right Planetary hours, which this Book will inform you; <hi>Example,</hi> If <hi>Mars</hi> be the afflicting Planet and is more ſtrong in eſſential dignities than <hi>Venus,</hi> then you muſt make choyce of ſuch Herbs which are under the dominion of <hi>Mars</hi> to cure ſuch infirmities which he uſually produceth, which this Book will alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with. There is no infirmity or diſeaſe whatſoever, but in a ſecond Cauſe proceedeth from the evil influence of the afflicting Planets; and what infirmity ſoever any Planet cauſeth, he hath Herbs by Sympathy to cure it: in this condition, heat muſt fetch out heat, even as if one ſhould burn ones Finger, and then heat it againſt the fire, which cureth by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy: Likewiſe, I have known a great cold taken, to be cured by a Pippin taken in cold water, <hi>Venus</hi> being ſtrong in eſſential dignities; and if we ſhould give cooling remedies when <hi>Mars</hi> is ſtrong, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Patient, as I have often proved; for it ſtands by reaſon, that if a weak man contend with a ſtrong man well armed, he muſt needs be worſted: but if <hi>Mars</hi> be the afflicting Planet, although ſtrong, and <hi>Venus</hi> alſo be near equal in ſtrength, then we muſt chaſe a ſelect leſſer Number of her herbs to joyn with <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſo the doſe muſt be proportionable accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſtrength and weakneſs, and ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies will be between both, rather adhereing unto the ſtrongeſt Planet.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Concerning <hi>Antipathy,</hi> admit the <hi>Moon</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:48251:11"/>
principal Significator of the ſick be afflicted by <hi>Saturn,</hi> a Planet Cold and Dry, and he weak in the Heavens, and the Planet which is of a contrary nature is ſtrong, as inſtance <hi>Jupiter</hi> who is Hot and Moiſt, then a ſelect Number of Herbs under the dominion of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vertue to cure the diſtemper muſt be uſed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they are gathered at the hour when <hi>Jupiter</hi> rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which this book will inform you. But if <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> be near equal in ſtrength, then uſe a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between both, and let one part of your Herbs be by Sympathy under <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the other part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Jupiter,</hi> alwayes adhereing unto the ſtronger Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, both by Number and Doſe; and ever remembring in all Cures whatſoever to uſe a ſelect number of Herbs which are under the <hi>Sun,</hi> in regard he is Fountain of Life, and ſole Monarch of the Heavens; and all thoſe Herbs which are under his Dominion are always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved good to comfort the Heart, Brain, Nerves, Arteries, and Vital Spirits, and are likewiſe good to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſt: Poyſon: Likewiſe in all Cures whatſoever, you muſt have regard unto the age of the Patient, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Complexion, and the ſeaſon of the year, that ſo you may help to ſupport Natures defects, for a Cholerick or Sanguine Man or Woman by nature requireth things more cooling then Flegmatick, or Melancholy Man or Woman, and a Flegmatique or Melancholy man or woman requires things more heating than a Cholerick or Sanguine man or woman; conſider the like between Youth and Age, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year. <hi>Note,</hi> that each herb or plant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Treatiſe, is ſet down by way of Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue under the Planet which owneth the Plant or Herb, it being done according unto their Elemental Qualities and Vertues; Having given ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:48251:12"/>
thereof, I confeſs I much differ from Authors, for what I have written in this book is no Tranſlation, being meerly according unto my Practice and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience for many years, by vertue of which Herbs and plants (through Gods bleſſing) I have done many great and wonderful cures, I dare ſay, greater hath not been done ſince the Apoſtles times, for I have cauſed the blind to ſee; the deafe to hear; both lame and bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid people to go; the dumb to ſpeak, ſuch who have been in extremity of pain, I have eaſed them; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I have cured all kinds of Evils, and all kinds of Agues; together with all ſorts of Madneſs, having in this Book given ſufficient reaſons for the ſame: I have likewiſe inſerted in this Book, the Names, and places of dwelling of ſundry perſons who have been by me cured of ſuch infirmities and griefs aforeſaid, and how performed; that ſo others may be informed how to do the like: I have alſo inſtructed the Learner, how by the <hi>Moon</hi> in acute, or <hi>Sun</hi> in Chronick griefs, or infirmities to find the diſeaſe with its cauſe, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. I have alſo ſhewed the way how to Erect a Figure, and thereby to give judgment, either upon the Decumbiture, ſight of the Urine or any ſtrong fit of the Patient. And for the benefit of ſuch who deſire farther inſpection into this Art of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> having by the Rules in this Book, or by their own ſtudy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto the perfect way of Erecting a Figure: I have ſhewed the way how to give judgment upon any horary queſtion, as Thefts, Strayes, Fugitives, and Urins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it being according unto my way of Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice and Experience for many yeares. I have alſo ſhewed the way and manner how I have caſt forth Devils, out of ſuch who were poſſeſt, that ſo others may be informed to do the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48251:12"/>
               <hi>Courteours Reader,</hi> what I have written in this Book, is not only for my own vindication againſt all ſcandals and falſe aſpertions which are uſually caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, by ſuch who are ignorant of my way of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but chiefly to inſtruct others, and to inable them to do the like Cures as I have done, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds may be kept from periſhing. There are many who do admire at the Cures by me done, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſatisfied of the Legallity of my way of Cure, do thereupon refuſe to come, or ſend to me for help, to cure their infirmities.</p>
            <p>And as for the vindication of the Art of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> I ſhall not at preſent trouble my ſelf or Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but ſhall refer thoſe who are unſatisfied, unto thoſe Epiſtles in my Almanacks, Dated <hi>Anno,</hi> 1658. and 1659. and unto many other authentique Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in Print.</p>

               <head>Some Obſervations Concerning Sympathy of Cure.</head>
               <p>VVHereas in the Catalogue of Plants, the Planet <hi>Saturn</hi> hath but very few Herbs or Plants allotted unto him: yet notwithſtanding in my Epiſtle before going, I told you, that what griefs or infirmities ſoever any Planet cauſed, there are herbs by Sympathy, as well as Antipathy to cure it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know that, although an Herb or Plant may by Elemental qualities be under the Dominion of <hi>Mars,</hi> as being hot and dry, and ſo gathered at his hour, yet in regard of his vertues, and being approved good to cure ſuch infirmities which are under the Dominion of <hi>Saturn,</hi> it may juſtly and rationally be called a Sympathetical Cure, by reaſon <hi>Mars</hi> is exalted in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn</hi> the houſe of <hi>Saturn.

<pb facs="tcp:48251:13"/>
Quartans, are uſually cauſed by <hi>Saturn.</hi> Now Worm-wood, Carduus, and ſuch like Plants being hot and dry, are properly attributed unto <hi>Mars,</hi> both in point of gathering and numbers, yet in regard theſe Herbs and Plants are of known vertues to cure Agues which <hi>Saturn</hi> cauſeth; and <hi>Mars</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in <hi>Capricorn</hi> which is the houſe of <hi>Saturn</hi>: therefore it may properly be called a Sympathetical Cure: And ſo Herbs under the Dominion of <hi>Sol,</hi> cure infirmities by Sympathy cauſed by <hi>Mars,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> is exalted in <hi>Aries</hi> the houſe of <hi>Mars</hi>: And ſo herbs under <hi>Venus</hi> cure by Sympathy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities under <hi>Jupiter,</hi> by reaſon <hi>Venus</hi> is exalted in <hi>Piſces</hi> the houſe of <hi>Jupiter</hi>; and ſo herbs of <hi>Jupiter</hi> cure by Sympathy ſuch diſeaſes which are under the dominion of the <hi>Moon,</hi> by reaſon <hi>Jupiter</hi> is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Cancer</hi> which is her houſe: The benefit which we have from this obſervation is as followeth; If <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Mars</hi> or any other Planet, be the afflicting Planet, and ſtrong (which argueth a Complyance) then thoſe herbs which are under the dominion of that Planet which is exalted in his houſe, being good for to cure the infirmity may be uſed and (for the reaſon aforeſaid) it ſhall be called a Sympathetical Cure, for when Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are ſtrong and afflicting we muſt comply with them, as I have elſewhere expreſſed. <hi>Note,</hi> that in all Sympathetical cures whatſoever, there muſt be one Elemental quality in the Planet of complyance, with the nature of the Planet afflicting; as for Example, Herbs under <hi>Mars</hi> have the quality of drith with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>; and Herbs under the <hi>Sun</hi> have the quality of heat with <hi>Mars</hi>; and Herbs under <hi>Venus</hi> have the quality of moyſture with <hi>Jupiter</hi>; And Herbs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Jupiter</hi> have the quality of moyſture with the <hi>Moon,</hi>

               <p>FIrſt, having by an Herbal found the virtue of the plant which is approved for the curing of ſuch infirmities or diſeaſes which are under the dominion of ſuch a planet, as cauſes them, although the herb or plant agree but in the firſt elemental quality of heat or cold, yet the herb or plant may juſtly and rationally be attributed unto the Planet which owns the grief, and ſo thereby make a ſympathetick cure: As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Jupiter</hi> who is by nature hot and moiſt, and hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy over the liver, lungs, blood, veins, pluriſies, and the like: Now by the Herbal we find, that lung-wort, wood-bittany, agremony, ſcurvigraſs, and ſuch like, are all good to cure ſuch infirmities, notwithſtanding they are all hot and dry in the firſt and ſecond degree, yet having the firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental quality of heat, together with virtue to cure ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which <hi>Jupiter</hi> cauſeth, they may juſtly be attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Jupiter</hi>; and ſo plantane, white beets, and dandelion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by Authors cold and dry, may juſtly be attributed unto <hi>Venus,</hi> as having the firſt elemental quality of being cold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48251:16"/>
ſuch defects which <hi>Venus</hi> cauſeth, or otherwiſe by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy unto <hi>Mars,</hi> as doth plantane, which cureth cuts and wounds which <hi>Mars</hi> cauſeth: Now white beets and dandelion cureth by ſympathy; the firſt bringeth down womens cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the other helpeth to cleanſe the paſſages of urin, always provided in theſe particular applications, that the firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental quality of heat or cold doth agree, as aforeſaid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be no true gathering or attributing the plant aright unto the Planet, as I have ſhewed more at large elſewhere. And farther, ſhould we not ſometimes uſe this particular way herein expreſſed, both <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> who are great friends unto Nature, would have very few herbs or plants allotted unto them, eſpecially <hi>Jupiter</hi> who is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune; for by the Herbal you ſhall find very few herbs or plants which doth accord in elemental qualities of heat and moiſture with <hi>Jupiter</hi>; and the truth is, I find that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do moſt of them agree in the firſt elemental quality, or part of heat or cold, but in the latter part of drith or moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſomewhat differing; and without queſtion they do but gueſs thereat, or otherwiſe by tradition follow each other; neither do they give true knowledge therein (eſpecially in many herbs and plants) as inſtance dandelion, which hath a known virtue to open and cleanſe the paſſages of urin: Now if this plant were cold and dry, which moſt Authors hold, how could it have this virtue to open and cleanſe? for of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity moiſture muſt do it, for all plants which are drying, are uſually ſtopping and binding; and ſo <hi>Saturn,</hi> a Planet cold and dry, when afflicting the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> in earthy ſigns, always produceth bindings in the body: Alſo the bloſſoms of plants are ſomewhat to be regarded, more eſpecially when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the firſt elemental quality of heat or cold; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wood-bittany, hyſſop, bugloſs, burrage, and ſuch like, whoſe bloſſoms are blew, a colour which ♃ owneth: And notwithſtanding they are all hot and dry (except burrage) yet they are rightly appropriated unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> by reaſon of their virtues, as curing ſuch defects which ♃ cauſeth. But ſhould we grant that herbs and plants, which are by Nature cold and dry, to be under <hi>Jupiter</hi> (as many learned Authors do hold as I could name) as inſtance endive, ſuccory, and ſuch like, there can be no reaſon given for it, by reaſon they are ſo much differing in elemental qualities, for the plants are cold and dry, and the Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi> hot and moiſt, clean oppoſite unto each other; wherefore it ſtandeth by reaſon, and is rational to be under <hi>Mercury,</hi> whoſe nature doth ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize, as being cold and dry, and ſo to cure by antipathy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48251:17"/>
unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the herbs being of known virtue to cure ſuch diſtempers, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> cauſeth; likewiſe I find that many Authors do attribute, clary, mints, peny royal, and many Others, unto <hi>Venus</hi> a planet cold and moiſt, whereas the herbs are all hot and dry, of a clean contrary nature. Now theſe plants doe properly belong to the <hi>Sun</hi>; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of their virtues, as being comfortable unto the heart and vital ſpirits, and being of ſweet ſmell and pleaſant taſte: I could inſtance many more, which Authors do wrongfully apply, as inſtance they attribute angelica, ſage, box, and ſuch like to be under the planet <hi>Saturn</hi> whereas the herbs are all hot and dry eſpecially box who is hot and dry in the fourth degree, both the firſt plants are without queſtion under the dominion of the <hi>Sun,</hi> as being of a good ſmell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taſte, and are of known virtues to comfort the heart, arteries, and vital ſpirits and to reſiſt poyſon. The other being very hot, and of bitter taſte rightly belongeth unto the planet <hi>Mars</hi> as agreeing in elemental qualities, I confeſs, I have read many Authors, and I find many of them accord, but clean out of the way of truth: The reaſon is, as I conceive, becauſe their works are many, or moſt of them but tranſlated, and ſo following by tradition each other, not well weighing the reaſons have likewiſe erred, but as to the virtues of herbs and plants they do for the moſt part accord, giving reaſons for the ſame.

Now to reconcile this or any other difference of the like nature, do as followeth; Let both Planets in queſtion at the time of gathering be in <hi>Conjunction, Sextile</hi> or <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, by this rule you may have the true planetary influence of both planets in queſtion: Alwayes provided that the Lord of the Hour doth accord with the firſt elemental quality of the planet be it hot or cold, wherefore in this condition <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> muſt be Lord of the Hour at the time of gathering the herb or plant accordingly. I ſhall inſtance one herb more; Suppoſe, I was minded to gather Sweet-marjerome, which plant is by many Authors appropriated unto the planet <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cury,</hi> the reaſon they give is becauſe <hi>Mercury</hi> is conjoyned in ſome particular operations of the brain, and this plant is of known virtue to comfort the brain. But by my rules and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, I find it to be under the dominion of the ſun; Firſt by reaſon of its elemental qualities as agreeing with heat and drith: Secondly in regard of its virtues, for all herbs and plants, which are of ſweet ſmell, and are of approved virtues to comfort the heart, brain, nerves and arteries, and vital ſpirits, as this plant is are juſtly and rationally accounted to be under the dominion of the <hi>Sun</hi> who is the fountain of life, Lord of <hi>Leo</hi> and exalted in <hi>Aries,</hi> whereas <hi>Mercury</hi> hath only predominancy over ſome particular operations of the brain, as he hath in all the five ſences. Its Generally approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all Authors that the bulk of the brain in all creatures, is under the dominion of the <hi>Moon.</hi> The vital and quickning part under the <hi>Sun,</hi> the operation of <hi>Mercury</hi> as aforeſaid. Now

to gather this plant at the right planetary hour, that ſo you may have the influence of both planets in queſtion, you muſt do as before expreſſed, let thoſe planets concerned be in either <hi>Conjunction, Trine,</hi> or <hi>Sextile,</hi> aſpect unto each other, at the time of gathering, or otherwiſe let the <hi>Moon</hi> be ſeparating and applying from the one planet to the other at the time of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by any of the before going aſpects: Example, If I were minded to gather the ſaid ſweet marjerome in <hi>September,</hi> 1669. about which time ſuch like plants are in their prime to gather. In which moneth upon the fourteenth day the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are in partil <hi>Conjunction,</hi> but their influence holds above a week before and after, for until they are ſeparated ten degrees from each other their Orbs, Raies, or Influence holds ſtrong unto perfection, wherefore you may gather this plant aright upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the fifth day, or upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the tenth day or upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the fifteenth day from the <hi>Suns</hi> riſing until the <hi>Sun</hi> is about an hour in hight; and likewiſe in the afternoon between one and two of the clock as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the perpetual Almanack for the day appointed.

               <p>IN the firſt place, before we come to ſet forth the Method of cure, it will be neceſſary to find what the grief is, and from what cauſe; without which its impoſſible to do any great cures.

I ſhall inſtance the 22 day of <hi>April</hi> 1668 about nine a clock at night, at which time <hi>I</hi> will ſuppoſe one took his bed: Now the queſtion is what the grief is, and whether the Sick will live or die: And when either death or recovery may be expected, you muſt in the firſt place by an Almanack find in what ſign the <hi>Moon</hi> is, and how aſpected: Now at the hour and time aforeſaid, the <hi>Moon</hi> will be in 5 <hi>deg.</hi> 48 <hi>min.</hi> of the ſign <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and at the ſame time. <hi>I</hi> find <hi>Mars</hi> to be in 5 <hi>deg.</hi> 48 <hi>min.</hi> of the ſign <hi>Scorpio,</hi> which maketh a partile <hi>Square</hi> aſpect conſiſting of 90 <hi>deg.</hi>: Now to find what the grief is you muſt repair unto the place in this book, where it is written, <hi>The Moon in</hi> Aquarius <hi>of</hi> Mars <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,</hi>

which argueth, that the Sick ſhall be troubled with great pain at the heart and with ſwooning fits alſo very fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouriſh, likewiſe a pain in the breaſt with difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the blood ſwelling in all the veins, the cauſe of this ſickneſs proceeding from violent affections and vehement paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp;c. Now the next thing conſiderable is to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sick be like to live or die; and the time when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death or recovery may be expected. Firſt the <hi>Moon</hi> is decreaſing in light, Secondly the <hi>Moon</hi> departeth from the <hi>Square</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> and applyed unto the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> both enemical planets: Thirdly, neither <hi>Sol, Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> doth caſt their friendly rayes or influence at the time aforeſaid unto the <hi>Moon,</hi> wherefore according unto the rules aforeſaid, the ſick perſon will die: To find the time, when you muſt frame a critical figure of ſixteen equal parts as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, begining at the place where the <hi>Moon</hi> was at the decumbiture, making that the firſt critical or mortal time, which if the Sick eſcape, then at the next critical or mortal time, you muſt obſerve how the <hi>Moon</hi> is aſpected, at which time you ſhall find the <hi>Moon</hi> meeteth with the oppoſition of ♂ being upon the 29th. day of <hi>April</hi> in the Month aforeſaid at one a clock after noon: Now in regard there is no fortunate planet interpoſing their friendly rays at that time we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the ſick wil depart, and not before, becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> at intercedental and judicial times meeteth with no bad aſpect of the infortunes. Yet notwithſtanding <hi>I</hi> have known ſome, who have been mortally ſtruck according, unto any rational mans judgment at the decumbiture in acute griefs, who through Gods bleſſing, having an expert and skilful Phyſitian, and having withſtood the bad influence of the afflicting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, at the firſt mortal time beyond expectation upon the next critical time have recovered, and ſo it may happily prove to ſome, who ſhall take their bed at the time aforeſaid. The reaſon is becauſe between the time of decumbiture and firſt criſis, there is uſually near ſeven days time, during which time (eſpecial remedies being applyed) the Sick may happily be the better enabled to with-ſtand the encounter, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the intercedental and judicial times be freed from the evil aſpects of the infortunes, as here it falleth out at this laſt decumbiture. The truth is life and death is in the hands of God, and whatſoever ſtars foreſhew, yet he by his power and bleſſing upon the means uſed can preſerve life, when he pleaſeth, wherefore the ſick ought not at any time to deſpair, For I my ſelf have oft times recovered my Patient having out lived the firſt mortal time as aforeſaid, but <hi>I</hi> muſt needs ſay

ſuch changes and chances are ſeldom ſeen, for where one doth eſcape many dieth, for the ſtars are God's Meſſengers, and what they do foreſhew, do aſſuredly without miracle come to paſs. Concerning the way and manner how to cure each diſtemper, I have ſhewed elſewhere.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Aſtrological way of giving Judgement by a Sign of <hi>12</hi> Houſes.</head>
               <p>Although what is already written, <hi>I</hi> have known by good experience to hold true by many examples it being for the moſt part the method of my daily practice; yet for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and better ſatisfaction of Practitioners, and others, well-willers thereunto, eſpecially ſuch who deſire further inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into this Art.

For <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs that in ſuch infirmities, which are natural from the birth, and likewiſe ſome chronick griefs, which have been of long continuance, and likewiſe ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, wherein there is any ſuſpition of witchcraft, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo exactly be diſcovered by the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> afflicted, as by a ſign of twelve houſes for the aſcendant ſixth, eighth, and twelfth Houſes with their Lords will be for the moſt part concerned therein as ſhall be ſhewed in order as followeth. In the firſt place you muſt erect your figure; either for the time of decumbiture, or for the time of any ſtrong fit (if any be) or upon the receipt of the Urin, or time of the firſt viſitation of the Patient, and you muſt be ſure for to frame, and vary your aſcendant, that it together with its Lord may exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate the Sick. Secondly you muſt in order ſet down the Cuſpe of every Houſe. Thirdly you muſt ſet down the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Planets in every Houſe, which for to do, and likewiſe how to frame the aſcendant, I ſhall briefly declare.

                  </gap>t place it will be neceſſary to know whether the grief be natural, or whether it came by Witchcraft or Sorcery: Now if you find the Lord of the twelfth houſe in the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or if the Lord of the twelfth being in the ſixth, or Lord of the ſixth in the twelfth, or if the Lord of the aſcendant be combuſt, that is, when the <hi>Sun</hi> is not above eight degrees thirty minutes diſtant from him, or if one planet be Lord of the aſcendant and twelfth houſe, and an infortune, then you may conclude that the grief is more than natural, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where there is any juſt ſuſpition thereof, which may be ſomewhat deferred by heeding well the nature of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48251:31"/>
as I have ſhewed elſewhere: But in this Figure I find no ſuch thing; wherefore I did conclude, the grief was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; occaſioned by his own diſorder of body: as ſhall be ſhewed in order.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I have known the aſcendent, the ſixth houſe, or their Lords have been afflicted by the Lord of the twelfth houſe and yet the ſickneſs was not from Witchcraft, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, thoſe ſuſpected evils; for if <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> or the <hi>Sun,</hi> do caſt their friendly aſpects unto the afflicted Planet or Cuſp of the Houſe aforeſaid, that then the grief came by ſome diſorder of body: Alſo, if that Lord of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant be in the twelfth, or in the ſixth, the grief is natural: For from the twelfth houſe, we give judgment of ſelf-undoing ſo well as otherwiſe; but any rational experienced practitioner may eaſily diſtinguiſh, the natural diſeaſes, from the unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, by heeding well the manner of their diſtempers, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: And generally I find that thoſe who are taken in this ſnare of Witchcraft, that at the time of any ſtrong fit, or when they are more than uſually tormented, that then the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant together with its Lord doth exactly perſonate the ſick; and at that very time, the Lord of the twelfth houſe doth one way or other afflict, either the aſcendant, or its Lord; or that an infortune Lord of the aſcendant and twelfth houſe, which may ſo happen, when the proper aſcendant is intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firſt houſe, as I have oft times experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to give judgment upon the decumbiture figure before mentioned; and in the firſt place, deſcribe the perſon of the ſick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> y rules diſcover, whether the ſick ſhall live or die, if live, how long time before recovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall by rules ſet forth, what the grief is, and from what came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How and which way he was recovered.</p>
               <p>The mans perſon is deſcribed by the aſcendant <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> his being therein who is Lord thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> one of a middle ſtature, full and well ſet, of a dark or ſwartiſh complection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad brown hair, as you may find more at large in this book.</p>
               <p>Signes of recovery, was firſt <hi>Saturn</hi> Lord of the aſcendant, being his ſignificator is ſtrong as being in his own houſe, and is more ſtrong than <hi>Mars</hi> who is the afflicting Planet. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Moon</hi> doth ſeparate from <hi>Mars,</hi> and apply firſt unto <hi>Venus</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> all fortunes.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48251:31"/>
Thirdly, the <hi>Sun</hi> is increaſing in light. Fourthly neither the <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Saturn</hi> are combuſt; Planets are ſaid to be combuſt, when they are not elongated eight <hi>deg.</hi> thirty <hi>min</hi> from the <hi>Sun.</hi> Fifthly, ſhe is not in that part of the Zodiack called <hi>via combuſta,</hi> which is from the middle of <hi>Libra</hi> to the midſt of <hi>Scorpio.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Venus</hi> Lady of the fourth houſe, which uſually ſheweth the end of all things of this nature, was in friendly aſpect to the <hi>Moon,</hi> at the time of decumbiture; all which are arguments of recovery. The time when follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Firſt, the angles of the figure are part fixt, and part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Secondly, the <hi>Moon</hi> was in a common ſign which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, that the grief was not perfectly, acute, nor yet chronick, but between both and ſo it proved, for upon the laſt critical day the feaver left him, at which time the <hi>Moon</hi> came to the place, ſhe was in at the decumbiture <hi>viz.</hi> unto the ninth <hi>deg</hi> of <hi>Sagitarius</hi>: yet notwithſtanding, at the laſt critical time he had a very ſtrong fit, the <hi>Moon</hi> being then in ſquare to <hi>Mars</hi>; but <hi>Venus</hi> fortune and Lady of the fourth houſe, being in friendly aſpect to the <hi>Moon,</hi> and ſhe together with <hi>Saturn</hi> being both more ſtrong than <hi>Mars,</hi> who was the afflicting Planet, put an end to this ſickneſs at the time aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The next thing conſiderable, is to diſcover the grief, and from what cauſe; and likewiſe, what infirmities ſhe was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſubject unto from the birth: Now concerning the preſent acute grief, I found the <hi>Moon</hi> being in the ſign <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitary,</hi> was the platick ſquare of <hi>Mars</hi> afflicted, for between the ſign <hi>Virgo,</hi> the place where <hi>Mars</hi> is, and the ſign <hi>Sagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the place where the <hi>Moon</hi> is, containeth ninety <hi>deg.</hi> which number maketh a ſquare had the <hi>Moon</hi> been but one degree in the ſign <hi>Sagitary</hi> yet that would have been a platick ſquare, for if we conſider the moity of each Orb, there will be ten <hi>deg.</hi> allotted, at which time and diſtance, the influence of thoſe Planets doth operate, both before and after any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Now to know what the preſent diſtemper was, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was an acute grief; you muſt find out the place in this book entituled, the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Sagitary,</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> oppreſſed, which argueth a high and ſtrong fever with the flux, or lask and cholerick paſſions; the pulſes few and taint heating ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his blood over heated. The bright Star of the Harp: and the Star called the Swans-bill, both of the nature of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the ?a cendant? made the fever the more violent: The cauſe of this ſickneſs was from inordinate exerciſe, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, or too much repletion, as you may find more at large at the place aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48251:32"/>The way of recovery was by application antipathetical unto <hi>Mars</hi> the afflicting planet by reaſon that <hi>Venu</hi> was more ſtrong in eſſential dignities, as being in her houſe. Now in regard that <hi>Mars</hi> is by nature hot and dry, I made choice of ſuch herbs and other remedies, which were cold and moiſt; wherefore I adviſed that ſuch decoctions, ſyrrups, or cordials, which were adminiſtred ſhould be cooling and cleanſing, alſo gliſters the like, ever remembring as in this, ſo in all other cures, to fortifie the heart and vital ſpirits with herbs under the dominion of the <hi>Sun:</hi> Would the Patient have been perſwaded to let blood, the fever would without queſtion, have left him, upon the ſecond critical time, the <hi>Moon</hi> meeting then with the friendly aſpect of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a fortune and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That as we give judgement by the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, in acute and chronick griefs, ſo by the ſame rules you may give judgement by the Lord of the aſcendant or ſixth houſe afflicted,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example,</hi> In the laſt figure, <hi>Mercury</hi> being Lord of the ſixth houſe, and in the ſign <hi>Libra,</hi> is in platick ſquare to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> and conjunction of the Sun, who is much of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> only the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtriketh more upon the vital ſpirits: Now according unto the rule in giving judgement by the <hi>Moon</hi> afflicted in the ſign <hi>Libra,</hi> it ſheweth a ſeveriſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper and blood over heated, occaſioned from ſurfeiting.</p>
               <p>The next thing conſiderable is to know, what infirmities naturally he was ſubject unto from the birth. In this queſtion judgement muſt be given from the aſcendant, ſixth houſe, and their Lords afflicted; firſt the aſcendant is no way afflicted, ſave onely by the preſence of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who is Lord thereof: Now in this queſtion <hi>Saturn</hi> is not accounted an enemy, notwithſtanding he is naturally evil, as being in his own houſe, and Lord of the ſick mans perſon, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the old ſaying, the devil will not hurt his own. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſixth houſe is no way afflicted, wherefore we have onely <hi>Mercury</hi> Lord of the ſixth conſiderable herein, and he I find is in <hi>Libra</hi> in platick coniunction of <hi>Venus</hi> Lady of the fourth. Now any planet although he be naturally a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune may afflict ſo well, as the infortunes being Lord or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the fourth, ſixth, eighth, or twelfth houſes, for every planet muſt do his Office to know what the grief is; you muſt take notice of the ſign, where <hi>Mercury</hi> Lord of the ſixth houſe is, <hi>videl.</hi> in <hi>Libra,</hi> and what parts of the body is ſignified thereby, alſo what griefs or infirmities are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>THat which I have found by daily practice and experience, is carefully ſo to erect your figure (either for the time of decumbiture, or the time of any ſtrong fit, or when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was more than ordinarily ſick or afflicted, or for the time when the urine is brought, or when you go to viſit the patient) that the Aſcendant together with its Lord may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly perſonate the Sick, for if neither the aſcendant nor the Lord thereof doth agree in ſhape, complexion, and hair with the body of the Sick, you cannot ſafely give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a figure of twelve houſes, eſpecially in many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as I have often experienced; for the firſt, fourth, ſixth, eighth, and twelfth houſes will be eſpecially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein; wherefore if you fail in the firſt foundation, the whole building muſt needs be obſtructed and out of order.</p>

Now <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſignifies a man of an upright and tall ſtature, complexion ruddy, face oval, full, and fleſhy, and a kind of a bourn brown hair: Alſo the ſign <hi>Sagitary</hi> repreſents a man much after the ſame ſhape and likeneſs, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears what a vaſt difference it might produce by takeing a wrong aſcendant, both in regard of the perſonal ſhape, and likewiſe in the diſcovery of the grief of the ſick: Whereas it appears by taking the true aſcendant, that it doth not on-only dilineate his perſon, as is before expreſſed, but doth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48251:33"/>
exactly diſcover his preſent diſtemper, and natural infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: For let the time of decumbiture or the time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the urine, or the time of any ſtrong fit be brought, and the Artiſt never ſo curious by enquiry, except by chance, he ſhall not get the true aſcendant, for many reaſons may be objected to the contrary: Firſt clocks may fail, and ſo ſick perſons will hold out longer then others before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and the urine may by the meſſenger be haſtened, or retarded, you ſee one hour maketh a mighty alteration.

This was the firſt cure I did within that City: This Maid having been about Twelve moneths under the Cure of ſeveral <hi>Doctors,</hi> and her Father finding that her grief rather increaſed than diminiſhed, and hearing by ſome what great Cures I had done in other places, came unto me, and after ſome communication I erected a Figure, by which, according unto the rules of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> I quic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as Gold is under the dominion of the <hi>Sun</hi> as being a Metal, ſo likewiſe are many herbs and plants under the dominion of the <hi>Sun</hi> accordingly as being vegetable, and being gathered at the right Planetary hours according unto their number worketh the ſame effects in cure, being worn or otherwiſe. This cure was effected by ſuch herbs ſuitable to the grief which were by antipathy unto <hi>Mercury,</hi> a Planet cold and dry, <hi>viz.</hi> under <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a Planet hot and moiſt, but by herbs which were by ſympathy, under the <hi>Sun,</hi> for let the <hi>Sun</hi> be ſtrong or weak there it no oppoſing of him, as being fountain of life; for in all cures whatſoever, herbs of the <hi>Sun</hi> muſt be uſed, and the rather in this cure, by reaſon the Maid was by nature Melancholy, and likewiſe afflicted under <hi>Mercury</hi> a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Planet. In all kinds of <hi>Evils,</hi> the plants and herbs uſed for cure, muſt be gathered at the right Planetary hours accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto their vertues and numbers: had this Maid been by nature Cholerick, then we might have uſed herbs under <hi>Venus,</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> as being afflicted under the <hi>Sun,</hi> for in all cures we muſt help to ſupport Natures defects, ſo well, as to fortify the Heart; but moſt uſually Melancholy People are afflicted under Melancholy cold Planet: and Cholerick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under hot planets, more eſpecially in <hi>Evils,</hi> for every Element Naturaly doth ſympathiſe with its own like, and doth more vehemently ſtrike thereupon then on the contrary, even as the actions of Men and Women do naturally ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſe with their Complexions be it Choller, or Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IT'S generally called the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> In regard it pleaſed God to give the Kings of this Nation that great gift of curing theſe kinds of infirmities: 'Tis not as many fooliſhly do imagine, called the <hi>Kings-Evil</hi> in regard of any ſins by them committed, and ſo for that cauſe it ſhould fall upon the Subject: for the <hi>Evil</hi> is directly from themſelves occaſioned by ſome extraordinary diſtemper of the brain, and ſo from thence diſperſed by the Nerves into ſeveral parts of the body ſometime I have known it fall into the Eyes and at other times into the Neck and Throat with white kernels, ſwellings; and ſometimes 'twill be in any other parts of the body and the ſwelling is alwayes white. Now in regard that Chyrurgions and Doctors in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times were ignorant, not only of the Cauſe but alſo of the way of cure by reaſon it lay wholly in the Nerves, for theſe kinds of <hi>Evils</hi> coming wholly from the Brain as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: at the firſt beginning never toucheth upon the Fleſh, Brain, or Blood only the Nerves are puffed up and riſeth in kernels white, whereupon ſuch applications which uſually cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other ſwellings were clear antipathetical unto theſe kinds of ſwellings, and rather increaſed than any way diminiſhed their pain: I have cured many of this kind of <hi>Evil</hi> alſo, as is well known unto many in the Country. Many times it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out to be in the <hi>Optick</hi>-Nerves, and then the Eyes are in a very ſad condition. About a year a go I cured the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of one <hi>John Alexander,</hi> living in <hi>Mortimer</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> ſhe was taken in both Eyes, they were ſo cloaſed up, that ſhe could not endure to have them opened whereby to apply any remedy, ſhe lay thus above ſix moneths quite blind, beſides what time the grief was drawing on before, and the more they tampered with her the worſe ſhe was; at length they were fearful that her Eyes would periſh in her head, (as it ſeems one Maids did who was of their acquaintance.) whereupon they came to me and having agreed upon the price for the cure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did undertake and perform it in about a moneths ſpace; the manner how I did perform it I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48251:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before I conclude, I do find that in, former ages multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes periſhed through theſe kinds of Evils, by reaſon (as I ſaid before) that Doctors and Chyrurgeons were ignorant of the true cauſe of the diſtemper, and ſo by conſequence of the cure; whereupon it pleaſed God to give this gift of healing, firſt, unto King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. who for his piety was called the Confeſſor, who was the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, who ſuecceeded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Deans</hi> wete extinguiſhed, and after him ſucceſſively this great gift hath continued unto the Kings of this Nation: I ſhall now proceed to ſet forth the way of cure, not only of this mans Daughter in queſtion, but alſo how to cure it in any part of the body, provided it be taken in hand in time, before the Nerves, Fleſh, and Bones are periſhed, for in length of time, if it be not cured, 'twill get into the Fleſh, Bones, and Blood: and then in the end, commonly that Limb or Member of the Body, be it arm, foot, legg, and ſometimes thigh and all is cut off: The way of curing this Maides eye, was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.

But unto the Eyes I applyed only Celandine-water, given in a ſmall tincture of <hi>Roman</hi>-Vitriol; but at the firſt beginning of the Cure, I did for a few dayes apply raw-freſh meat to the powl or Neck to help dry and divert the humour from the Eyes; by this means through Gods bleſſing ſhe was ſoon recovered. Now the way to cure this kind of Evil when it ſetleth in any other part of the body, is as followeth, You muſt in the firſt place make uſe of three Solary Herbs, as aforeſaid, to wear about their neck: alſo you muſt make a bath of Solary Herbs, according unto the number before mentioned, belonging unto the <hi>Sun,</hi> and being gathered at the right Planetary hour: alſo out of the ſame herbs, you muſt make an oyntment, and once a day you muſt bath the place grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved pretty hot, and then immediately with this oyntment anoynt it, and keep it moderately warm, you muſt be ſure
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48251:58"/>
to make choice of ſuch ſolary herbs, which are eſteemed good for the brain and nerves, as you will find in this Book elſewhere: I ſhall relate one <hi>Example,</hi> This year I cured a Maid, who was the only daughter of Mr. <hi>Henry Bulſtrode,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>Warfield</hi> Pariſh in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> ſhe had the evil in her ear and right ſide of her head, being moſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pained therewith: Her Father tryed many Doctors and others to his great coſt and charge, but inſtead of mending ſhe grew worſe every day than other, and the more they tampered with her, the more ſhe was afflicted; the ſwelling was white, ſhe was in this condition about nine moneths: at length finding no remedy, and hearing by ſome of his Neighbours, what great cures I had done for others, her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came unto me, and having agreed with me about the charge, I did undertake the cure, and in about ſix weeks time did perfect the cure accordingly. The way which I uſed was according to what I have already declared: <hi>Viz.</hi> By Diet-drinks, Baths ointments, and herbs to wear about her neck, as is before expreſſed. All the herbs uſed were Sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. and gathered at the true planetary hour, agreeing with the number attributed to the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That when the <hi>Sun</hi> or any other planet, whoſe herbs you intend to uſe be ſtrong in the heavens, the leſſer numbers will ſerve; but when they are weak then the greater numbers muſt be uſed: A planet is ſaid to be ſtrong when he is in eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dignities, and weak when out of dignities in the heavens, the reaſons I have ſhewed elſewhere in this Book.</p>

               <head>Another kind of Evil, commonly called <hi>Atake.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MOſt People call this kind of Evil <hi>Atake,</hi> by reaſon, that the Patient is on the ſudden perplexed with great pain, whereas uſually natural infirmities doe firſt mind the Patient, before it increaſeth unto extreamity, according as the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the afflicting Planets draweth unto partile aſpect of the ſignificator of the Patient; and if a figure be ſet for the time, when the pain did firſt aſſault the patient, one may by the rules of Aſtrology eaſily diſcover from what cauſe the grief came, and whether natural or from Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>The way which the Witches uſually take for to afflict Man or Beaſt in this kind, is as I conceive, done by image or moddel made in the likeneſs of that Man or Beaſt they intend to work miſchief upon, and by the ſubtilty of the Devil made at ſuch hours and times, when it ſhall work moſt powerful

upon them by thorn, pin, or needle prickt into that Limb or part of the Image, which anſwereth to that limb or member of the body afflicted. For <hi>Example,</hi> I ſhall relate what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened lately as I am credibly informed. An Old woman, who lived near the <hi>Deviſes</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> (ſhe was impriſoned about the time, when I began to write this book, in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now immediately after ſhe was gone, they went to the place, and there found an image like a man with a thorn prickt into it, at which time there was a man in the Pariſh, who was in great tormenting pain in one of his limbs, which by compare did anſwer to that limb prickt with a thorn into the image: and when they took forth the thorn, the man had preſent eaſe, but when they put the thorn in again the man was tormented. When witchcraft is wrought only by image prickt as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Patient is uſually pained outwardly, in one limb, member, or part of the body and the ſwelling if any is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally white: There is no pain whatſoever more tormenting, than it, and commonly ſuch pains are white ſwellings; and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually with moſt people called evils or <hi>Takes,</hi> not thinking from what cauſe it cometh. Yet I am of opinion and do find by experience, that all white ſwellings are not ſuch evils, which cometh from evil perſons, for it may proceed from ſome extraordinary diſtemper of the nerves, ſuch as is the evil commonly called the Kings evil, as I have already declared. Its obſervable that in all kinds of evil, the more they are temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the worſe they are; for except the right way of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be applyed, the Patient will be but the more tormented: I know many have loſt their limbs and ſometimes life, and all in regard thoſe who have undertaken to cure them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unskilled in the way of Aſtrology could not effect the cure. I have cured many, who have been taken in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to my knowledge have never failed, where the Patient was cureable but when the bones, ſinews, nerves, and arteries, and fleſh is periſhed before one begins, and joynts diſlocated, then there can be no perfect cure expected, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome good may be wrought in ſtaying farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. There is no grief or infirmity whatſoever, but may through Witchcraft and Sorcery, by the help of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be wrought upon the bodies of men and beaſt, and I could inſtance many, which I have cured. I ſhall mention two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: The firſt being a cure done upon a Maid living at <hi>Newton</hi> near <hi>Newbery</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> ſhe lay two years bed-rid, and could wag neither hand nor foot; her father told
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48251:59"/>
me he had tryed many Doctors, which coſt him above an hundred pounds, but ſhe was never the better, but rather the worſe; ſhe took no ſuſtenance, ſave onely verjuice poſſet, For if at any time ſhe took ought elſe, ſhe ſoon did vomit it up all, her body and limbs outward, were taken in the nature of a dead Palſie and her inward parts with a great ſtop at the breaſt and ſtomack, her Father told me the time when ſhe firſt took her bed, by which I erected a Scheme, and according unto the rules of Aſtrology, I told her Father, I found ſhe was taken either by Witchcraft or Sorcery, if not both, and that was the reaſon why the drug Doctors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not help her; I undertook the cure at a price, and within eight weeks, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered both her body and limbs, and ſhe hath continued well ever ſince, it being above nine years ago, ſince the cure was done. <hi>The Way how to cure either Witchcraft or Sorcery is ſet down in another place in this Book.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the firſt place I endeavoured to afflict the Witch</hi>; and then by diet drinks and ointments made of planetary herbs <hi>antipathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> unto the afflicting planet (being <hi>Saturn</hi>) gathered at the planetary hours, their qualities, virtues, and numbers, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding; the herbs uſed were under the dominion of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi> It appeareth that both Witchcraft and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery had been wrought upon the Maid, by reaſon that both her limbs outward, and body inward, were afflicted as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. <hi>Objection,</hi> If Witchcraft worketh alone only but upon one limb or member of the body as before is declared; then how cometh it to paſs, that her whole body and limbs generally were thus made uſeleſs, To which I anſwer that if the thorn, pin or needle were prickt in the head, when the ſign that is the <hi>Moon</hi> was in <hi>Aries,</hi> and that the infortunes as inſtance <hi>Saturn</hi> were in bad aſpect unto her (as probable it was) when the Witch firſt began her miſchief, then it might unhappily work miſchief or damage unto the whole body: for it ſtandeth by good reaſon that if the brain, which is the fountain from whence the Nerves do proceed be oppreſſed, that then the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole body muſt needs be obſtructed, for the Nerves which is a ſmall ſtring that runneth under the veins through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole frame of the body proceeding from the brain are the onely ſenſitive part of motion; Inſomuch that if a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion happen to prick a nerve, when he letteth any one blood, the limb will be in danger to be uſeleſs, and I heard of two, who loſt the uſe of their arms thereby When I liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and as it fareth with the body to be ſenceleſs and ſo uſeleſs, when the brain and nerves are oppreſſed, ſo
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48251:60"/>
likewiſe it fareth with the body, as being dead, and void of life, when the heart and arteries are oppreſſed, I ſhall inſtance one example hereof, about eight or nine years ago I cured a Maid, whoſe name was <hi>Mary Boyer,</hi> ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen years of age, her Father, together with this maid did live in <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> being above eight miles from my dwelling: he brought her to my houſe where I now dwell to be cured; her condition was as followeth, Every day near the ſame hour ſhe was taken with a great pain and pricking at her heart, and then immediately, ſounding fits followed, laſting two or three hours; ſhe was above twelve moneths in this condition before I undertook the cure; and as her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told me, he had been at great charge going after many Doctors, and yet notwithſtanding, was rather worſe, than any whit amended, and no marvel, for how can any Doctor cure ſuch diſtempers, when they are ignorant of the cauſe, for Witchcraft or Sorcery can no way be diſcovered, nor yet cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but by the way of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> except a Miracle be wrought, 'tis true, God can do what he pleaſeth; but I never knew, or heard of any Man or Beaſt that was cured (ſince the Apoſtles times) that were bewitched, any other way, than by the <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical</hi> way of Phyſick: and 'tis a great mercy, that God is pleaſed to raiſe up, and to give knowledge unto a mortal man to do it; for, although the afflictions of this kind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Devil and his inſtruments, which we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call evils or takes, yet the cure cometh by, and through Gods bleſſing upon the honeſt induſtry of the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who are the men only acquainted with theſe kinds of cures: and as it pleaſeth God to ſuffer the Devil and his Inſtruments the Witches to afflict his people, by reaſon of their neglect of duty and Prayer: ſo again, it pleaſeth God through Prayers joyned with lawful means, to take off their power, and to return the evil back from whence it came, and ſo to have their infirmities and diſeaſes cured: theſe cures are not done as many fooliſhly do imagine, by ſuch who are called white Witches, for the white Witches and the black Witches are all one, as I ſhall make appear, and tis but a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſo the grief being gotten into the fleſh, bones, blood, nerves, arteries and the like, that then they could not cure them, for then Remedies proper made with planetary herbs, as dyet-drinks, bathes, oyntments, and ſuch like remedies, as I have elſewhere expreſſed, muſt be uſed, for 'tis not enough when gotten into the fleſh and blood, to take out the thorn or pin; and thoſe who go unto ſuch cunning women, if they ſtay too long as aforeſaid, are afterwards inforced to come unto me, or ſome others, who are skilled in the Art of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> for cure, for Witches cannot help them; and I have known ſometimes, that ſuſpected Witches when they could not help their Patients, have come unto me for remedies, and I have cured them.</p>

very early in the morning to fetch water from the Conduit, now the cuſtom is, firſt come, firſt ſerved; it ſo fell out, that this maid and another maid meeting at the place, fell together by the ears concerning who ſhould be firſt ſerved, whereupon, the other maid being worſted vowed revenge; and the ſame day immediately after, ſhe was taken in this condition, as I ſhall relate: now her Father told me, that the other maid lived with one who was much ſuſpected to be a Witch, and according unto my Figure which was ſet for the day and hour when ſhe was firſt taken in this condition, I found, that ſhe was afflicted by the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> Lord of the twelfth, which is the houſe of Witchcraft, which Planet, according unto the rules of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> did exactly perſonate the ſuſpected Witch. The power of Witchcraft was ſo ſtrongly wrought upon this maid, that for twelve moneths together ſhe could not go into any bed until after midnight; beſides her daily fits, which uſually took her near one hour of the day as followeth; firſt, when the fit began it would prick about her heart, as if needles were thruſt into her, and then immediately after it would diſperſe throughout her whole body by the arteries, and then for ſome hours ſhe would ſeem dead: and further, the power of Witchcraft was ſo ſtrong upon her, that if at any time of the day, or night, (before midnight) ſhe did but touch any bed, ſhe would immediately fall into a fit, as I at her firſt coming did make ſeveral tryals, I conceive, that the Witch did not only work by Witchcraft alone, by Image prickt into the heart which by ſympathy, through the ſubtilty of the Devil did work upon the heart and arteries of the maid, but alſo did uſe ſome way of Sorcery whereby to aflict her inward parts, for ſhe was much troubled with griping pains in her belly and ſtomack, whereas formerly ſhe was healthful: now the way uſed for the curing of this maid, was as followeth, firſt, according unto the rules hereafter mentioned, I did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to afflict the Witch to the end, ſhe might forbear to act any farther in her villany. Secondly I made her dyet drinks, by decoctions with ſuch herbs being gathered at their right planetary hours, which were under the dominion of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> being antipathetical unto the afflicting Planet <hi>Saturn</hi>; and likewiſe with thoſe herbs <hi>I</hi> made oyntments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to comfort the heart and arteries, with cataplaſms to the hand-wreſts, ſometimes when I found the veins high, I let her blood, fearing the arteries might be oppreſſed thereby, for as I have already declared the arteries and nerves run both under the veins: <hi>I</hi> likewiſe for a time accuſtomed her to eat hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

help to fortify her heart: I alſo gave her water-grewel made with ſuch herbs which were agreeable to her condition, to be taken an hour after ſhe had taken her dyet-drink every morning as indeed we uſually do in all diſtempers, according unto which rules before going this maid was well and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured within ten weeks, notwithſtanding, ſhe was above twelve moneths in this condition before ſhe came unto me: and notwithſtanding, her Father as he told me had tryed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctors to his great charge, for as in this, ſo in all other kinds of evils, the more they are tampered with the worſe the patient will be, except they had the knowledge by the rules of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> to underſtand the way of Cure.</p>

               <p>I find by experience, that there is another kind of Evil wherewith many are infected, and I ſhall inſtance one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. A woman living at a place called <hi>Nutbeam</hi> within a mile of <hi>Way-hill</hi> where once a year the great fair is kept, was taken with this kind of evil as followeth: the cauſe of this womans diſtemper was from Sorcery, as by my Figure was diſcovered and the party ſuſpected was the Miniſter of the Pariſh, by my Figure deſcribed to be a man of <hi>Saturn,</hi> in the times of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which ſignifies a man of reaſonable ſtature ſwarthy complection, and of a lumpiſh countenance, and ſad or black hair; he was a man of ſmall wealth, only hired to execute the office or Function, for the time being: the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion which moved him to do it, was, as the woman told me, becauſe ſhe would not truſt him for mault; whereupon he threatned revenge, and at a goſſiping feaſt he had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do it, as followeth; Firſt, he moved to have a health go round the table, and ſo did undertake to ſpice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones cup, but when it came unto this womans turn to drink, ſhe did obſerve, that he took ſpice out of another paper which he had prepared, pretending that it was all one: this woman told me ſhe was not willing to take it, fearing leaſt he ſhould do her ſome miſchief; but being unwilling to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe the company, well-hoping that his malice would not have laſted ſo long, ſhe drank it, after which, before the day was ended, ſhe began to be very ill, being taken with a great pain and griping in her belly, and likewiſe every day encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in bigneſs of body, being grown ſo big as three ordinary women, inſomuch, at length a reaſonable horſe could not well

much ſuſpected to be a Witch, and minding to make ſport with her, calls her old witch, demanding whether ſhe was going, ſhe not anſwering, he threw ſeveral ſtones at her, with that ſhe began to be angry, and ſaith unto him (as the boy after he could ſpeak related) ſirrah I will make you hold your tongue, uſing many threatning ſpeeches; and indeavoured to run after the boy, who was too nimble on foot for her: After which time during three years, as aboveſaid, he became ſpeechleſs and ſeeming ſimple, and ſo might without queſtion have continued unto this day (without miracle) had not the Aſtrological way been uſed both for the diſcovery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his diſtemper. The Friends of this boy told me they had ſpent much mony about his cure, but to no purpoſe, having as they ſaid tryed many Doctors and others, inſomuch that they thought him uncureable: But by accident hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me, and of the many cures by me done, the friends of this boy came unto me, deſiring to know whether I would undertake to help him to his ſpeech again: I ask'd them, if they could tell the time, when he firſt loſt his ſpeech, which they readily told me. It being done upon a holy day, they could the better do it, whereupon having erected a figure, according unto the day or time given, <hi>I</hi> quickly found the cauſe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper (without which there could be no cure wrought) and told them, that I was confident through Gods bleſſing, that I could help them The Planet afflicting was ♄ a cold, dry, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, earthy, evil Planet: the defect lay wholly in the <hi>

I believe it will be a warning unto him, how to meddle with ſuch Creatures in a morning without prayer. I ſhall relate one paſſage, which happened between the Boys Unkle and my ſelf, as followeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The month being expired, wihich was the time ſet for the Boys cure, he came to ſee whether the Boy could ſpeak or no, whereupon I called in the boy and bad him ſpeak to his unckle, which he did, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to know how all his friends did; whereupon his Unkle ſeemed to be much troubled, and ſad, for as he told me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, he did verily believe, that I had infuſed a ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boy to make him ſpeak; and his reaſon was becauſe the Doctors and others, who had undertaken to help him (but could not) ſaid he would never be cured, as they verily believed by any man whatſoever: whereupon the boys Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle deſired me to keep him ſomewhat longer, and then he would come and bring money for the cure: The reaſon why he brought no money with him, was, becauſe he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I could help him; and he made his bargain ſo, that if I did not cure the boy, I was to have nought for my charge and pains. And about a week after he came privately to my Servants, deſiring to ſpeak with the boy, which he did, and then, but not before he was ſatisfied, for the boy could both pray and readily give anſwers unto queſtions. After which, about a week following, he came again with one of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who both heard the boy ſpeak and pray again, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48251:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was fully ſatisfied, paying me, what we had agreed upon for the cure. It ſeems they were not onely diſheartened by Phyſitians, but alſo hearing that I did many times ſet figures, concerning Nativities, thefts, ſtrays, and fugitives, &amp;c. As though I had wrought the cure by unlawful means. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted, I gave them both ſuch ample ſatisfaction, that they went away well contented and ſatisfied, being joyful, that it was their good hap to come unto me.</p>
               <p>Now whether this Boy was by this woman bewitched or whether it pleaſed God to lay ſuch an affliction upon the Boy. It may be a queſtion worthy of anſwer; unto which I ſhall briefly reply in point of art, That in regard the only afflicting planet was Lord of the twelfth and an evil planet, <hi>I</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the infirmity might proceed from faſcination or witchcraft, but not without Gods permiſſion, for (as I have elſewhere declared) if we neglect daily prayers, we lie ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the aſſaults of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and his Inſtruments for the time being; eſpecially in our bodies: For our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> taught us to pray daily, not only for bread but alſo to deliver us from evil, wherein, if we fail, the fault is ours.</p>

               <p>THe way to know whether the patient be bewitched or not I have already ſet down, elſewhere in this Book. I find by experience, that thoſe, who are taken in the ſnare of witchcraft are uſually afflicted in ſome outward limb or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body cauſed by an image made in the likeneſs of man or beaſt, and through the ſubtilty of the Devil made at ſuch hours and times, when by ſympathy it ſhall reflect upon the man or beaſt whom they intend to hurt or deſtroy; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done by thorn, pin, or needle prickt into that part of the image, which anſwereth unto that part of the body of man or beaſt wherein they are pained or grieved. An <hi>Example</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have already mentioned, concerning the Woman lately taken at the <hi>Deviſes</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>: But that which <hi>I</hi> conceive is the moſt uſual way practiſed by Witches is moſt properly called Sorcery: For by the help of the Devil ſome poyſonous matter is prepared, and mixt with ſome blood and vital ſpirit of the Witch, and ſo by ſmell or taſte infuſed into the body of man or beaſt bewitched, or rather by which they are infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For its obſervable in Philoſophy: <hi>Si acceperis terram ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daveroſam cujuſcunque viri mulierisve, qui notabili quocunque morbo moriebatur, eandemque des ullo maſculo aut foeminae, eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem morbo contaminabuntur; in morbis aliquibus odore tantùm hoc efficitur, Exempla gratia, in peſte, Lue Venereae, ſeu morbo Gallico Elephantiaſi ſive Lepra.</hi>

and ſpoiled, as inſtance bear cream, and milk, whey, and ſuch like, that neither Houſewife or Dairy Maid could make any good uſe thereof. I ſhall relate one <hi>Example</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. when I was a Boy my Father kept a Dairy at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Shenfield</hi> near <hi>Reading,</hi> and one of my Siſters had the charge thereof, upon a time my Father deſired her to make ſome wilde curds, and to ſend them home; which ſhe did endeavour to do, but could make none. The reaſon was, as ſhe conceived becauſe an Old woman (ſuſpected for a witch) was at that time denyed whey, who went muttering away diſcontented. The next day my Father came with one of his Brothers, named <hi>John Blagrave,</hi> a man of great knowledge in Aſtrology and Philoſophy, as appears by his many works in print Now my Father aſkt her why ſhe ſent him no curds, ſhe told him, ſhe could make none, notwithſtanding ſhe had uſed her beſt ſkill; and related what is aforeſaid concerning the Woman ſuſpected: Now my Fathers Brother aforeſaid being deſirous to make further tryal hereof went into the Houſe, and cauſed the whey to be hung over the fire again which no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er was done, but preſently it rumbled, and made a noiſe, as if many bullets had been in it, whereupon he cauſed the Kettle and whey to be taken from the fire, and cauſed a greater fire to be made: He alſo called for a cord and an iron wedge, he took the cord, and bound the Kettle round about, and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it very hard, and then cauſed the Kettle with whey to be ſet over the fire again, and having heat the wedge red hot, put him into the whey, and immediately there was abundance of curds roſe up, after which my Unckle ſent a meſſenger to the ſuſpected Witches houſe to know how ſhe did, who brought word, that after much knocking at length ſhe opened the door, where he found the Witch or ſuſpected perſon ſhrunk up like a purſe or leather put into the fire. By which it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that part of the vital ſpirit of the Witch was infuſed into the whey, for otherwiſe it could not have wrought ſo violently upon her, for ſhould the poyſonous matter, or thing be given or uſed alone without ſome blood or vital ſpirit of the Witch mingled with it, the burning of the patients blood or urin would not hurt them, or the putting this red hot wedg into the whey, could no way have afflicted her, which it did by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, as appeared by her body being ſhrunk up as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>THe curing of ſuch who are bewitched, is not done only by ſuch, who are called white Witches, (as many fooliſh do imagine) for the white Witch and the black Witch are all one, as I have elſewhere expreſſed, they are but confederate Witches, the one Witch by thorn, pin, or needle pricks into the Image through the ſubtilty of the Devil cauſeth the infirmity, pain, or lameneſs; the other Witch giveth forth, that ſhe can cure, and ſo when the friends of the bewitched cometh unto the white Witch, or cunning wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (they divide the gain) and the cure is quickly done, its but pulling forth, the thorn, pin or needle, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is cured, and I have been credibly informed by ſome who have gon to theſe cunning women, or white Witches; that their Cattle, or the Patient afflicted have been perfectly well before they have gotten home: but as I have already declared, after either man or beaſt have been bewitched above moneth, they cannot cure them, eſpecially, if the pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in one place all that time but ſometimes they will move the thorn, pin, or needle into ſome other part of the body, that ſo they may have remedy when they come unto them; for after the pain or infirmity have been of above a moneth ſtanding, the grief will get into the fleſh, blood and vital parts, and then the pulling forth of the thorn, and the reſt will do the Patient but little good, and cannot poſſibly help them, wherefore in this condition the Patients friends muſt of neceſſity repair unto ſuch who are well skilled in <hi>Aſtrological</hi> and <hi>Philoſophical</hi> way of cure as I ſhall declare in order hereunto, but before we proceed unto the way of cure, it will be neceſſary to ſhew, how to afflict the Witch, that ſo ſhe may be diſcouraged to act any further in her miſchief: for notwithſtanding their witchcraft by image, as aforeſaid, yet I ſeldom find, eſpecially where the Patient hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a moneth bewitched, but that Sorcery is wrought ſo well as Witchcraft, upon the Patient; and ſometimes immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together with the Witchcraft, eſpecially, where there are no confederate Witches, for the white Witches cannot help, where Sorcery hath been wrought upon the Patient, by reaſon it breaketh forth immediately into ſome Poyſonous or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious inward grief or infirmity, which can no way be cured (except by accident) but by the <hi>Aſtrological, Philoſophical</hi> way of Phyſick.</p>

               <head>Here followeth ſome experimental Rules, whereby to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Witch, cauſing the evil to return back upon them.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ONe way is by watching the ſuſpected party, when they go into their houſe; And then preſently to take ſome of her thatch from over the door, or a tile, if the Houſe be tyled; if it be thatch you muſt wet and ſprinkle it over with the patients water, and likewiſe with white ſalt, then let it burn or ſmoke through a trivet, or the frame of a ſkillet: you muſt bury the aſhes that way, which the ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Witch liveth. Its beſt done either at the change, full, or quarters of the <hi>Moon:</hi> Or otherwiſe, when the Witches ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator is in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>Moon.</hi> But if the Witches houſe be tiled, then take a tile from over the door, heat him red hot, put ſalt into the patients water, and daſh it upon the red hot tile, until it be conſumed, and let it ſmoke through a trivet or frame of a ſkillet, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another way is to get two new horſeſhooes, heat one of them red hot, and quench him in the patients urine, then immediately nail him on the inſide of the threſhold of the door with three nailes, the heel being upwards: then hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the patients urine ſet it over the fire, and ſet a trivet over it, put into it three horſe nails, and a little white ſalt: Then heat the other horſhooe red hot, and quench him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times in the urine, and ſo let it boil and waſte until all be conſumed; do this three times and let it be near the change, full, or quarters of the <hi>Moon</hi>; or let the <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> unto the Witches Significator</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another way is to ſtop the urine of the Patient, cloſe up in a bottle, and put into it three nails, pins, or needles, with a little white Salt, keeping the urine alwayes warm: If you let it remain long in the bottle, it will endanger the witches life: for <hi>I</hi> have found by experience, that they will be grievouſly tormented making their water with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if any at all, and the more if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Scorpio</hi> in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to his Significator, when its done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another way is either at the new, full, or quarters of the moon; but more eſpecially, when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the Planet, which doth perſonate the Witch, to let the patient blood, and while the blood is warm, put a little white ſalt into it, then let it burn and ſmoke through a trivet, I conceive this way doth more afflict the Witch,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48251:67"/>
then any of the other three before mentioned by reaſon the blood hath more life in it then the urine; for the urine is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, but as the excrement of blood: The reaſon why the Witch is tormented, when the blood or urine of the patient is burned, is becauſe there is part of the vital ſpirit of the Witch in it, for ſuch is the ſubtlety of the Devil, that he will not ſuffer the Witch to infuſe any poyſonous matter into the body of man or beaſt, without ſome of the Witches blood mingled with it, as appeareth by the whey before mentioned. For 'tis the Devils policy, either by this means to detect them or otherwiſe by torment to bring them unto their ends: for the devil well knoweth, that when the blood or urine of the patient is burned, that the Witch will be afflicted, and then they will deſire to come to the place, for to get eaſe, for by the ſmell thereof, their pain is mitigated by ſympathy; even as by ſympathy, when the blood and urine is burning, they are tormented, yet ſometimes they, will rather indure the miſery of it than appear, by reaſon country people oft times will fall upon them, and ſcratch and abuſe them ſhrewdly. I conceive the onely reaſon the devil doth ſuck the Witches blood is mearly to detect them, or otherwiſe one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bring them to their ends, and ſometimes they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered by their tet, at which place the Devil uſually ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their blood, whereby to mix with the poiſon, which they by their wicked ways do infuſe into the body of man or beaſt, and ſo infect them. I do find by practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that few or none are bewitched by Image or Moddel alone, but that there is Sorcery wrought with it for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the burning of the blood or urine of the patient could no way afflict them in any ſympathetick way, as aforeſaid; having by the rules aforegoing ſet forth the way, how to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Witch. I ſhall in the next place diſcover the general way of cure.</p>

               <p>THe Aſtrological way whereby to give judgement at the view or firſt ſight of the urine, both in acute and chronick griefs, is immediately to erect a figure, and ſo to vary your aſcendant that it may be radical and that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant together with its Lord may perſonate the ſick, and if the griefs be acute, then the time of decumbiture or firſt falling ill, muſt be inquired after, that ſo the aſſured place of the <hi>Moon</hi> in any of the twelve Signs may be obtained, for by the <hi>Moon</hi> in any of the twelve Signs afflicted of the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the grief is diſcovered together with its cauſe and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But if the grief be chronick that is of above a Months ſtanding then from the <hi>Sun</hi> the aſcendant ſixth houſe and their Lords afflicted, judgment is uſually given. In regard <hi>I</hi> have already at large ſet forth my way of practice herein, I ſhall in this place onely in brief ſet down, what I find concerning my experience in urins, for although an exact judgement both concerning the grief, together with its cauſe and termination (by urine) cannot be obtained, yet ſome general judgements thereby may be given, which may well ſerve for a four penny reward: Firſt if the urin be of an amber colour (and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ill) for generally that coloured urine ſheweth health of body) Then the grief or infirmity lyeth in the vital and animal ſpirits from whence doth proceed palſies, palpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and convulſions, and ſuch like diſtempers: In this condition the urine is not concerned by reaſon the blood and thoſe paſſages from whence the urine doth proceed, are not infected, for the urine is but the excrement of blood; if the urine be white or paleiſh, it ſheweth great weakneſs both in ſtomach and body, and if the urine be high coloured and red, it argueth a fever, or that ſome extraordinary pain doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Sick, but the place where and cauſe why cannot be known without a figure: ſometimes it ſheweth plenitude of blood; eſpecially if the veins be high, if gravel or red ſand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the bottom it ſheweth the Stone in the reins, kidnies, or bladder. If the urine be of a light ſandy colour, and ſomewhat thick, it ſheweth great cold taken, and oft times it turneth unto an ague, and if the urine be ſlimy and ſomwhat thick, it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth worms in young people, and conſumptions in elder; but if the urine be green or black coloured it uſually ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death to enſue, alſo if the urine be of a ſad brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it threatneth death, I queſtion not but that Authors have largely and learnedly written hereupon, unto whom I ſhall

               <p>THe occaſion which firſt moved me to undertake the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting forth of Devils was as followeth. One Goodman <hi>Alexander</hi> a Turner by trade, living at <hi>Baſing-ſtoke</hi> in the County of <hi>Southampton</hi> had a Daughter, who was not onely perplexed with very ſtrong fits, which uſually took her eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day near the ſame hour, every fit laſting above twelve hours, being very terrible to behold, during which time with many ſhrieks and cries, and through extream torment ſhe was brought ſo low, both in body and Spirit, that ſhe could not move or wag any part of her body or limbs from the middle downward; her Father told me he had ſpent much money upon ſeveral Doctors and others but they could do her no good, whereupon hearing by ſome, what great cures I had done, he came and told me what her condition was, as I have in part related, deſiring me to undertake the cure. <hi>I</hi> deſired to know at what hour and time her fits uſually did begin, which he told me, according unto which time I did erect a Scheam, and according to the Rules of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> in this book elſewhere expreſſed, I did find ſhe was either bewitched or poſſeſſed: Her Father was very earneſt with me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the cure, and I could not blame him ſhe having been in this condition, above twelve months; and beſides he made his bargain ſo, that it <hi>I</hi> did not effect the cure, I was to loſe all my pains and charges upon which, agreement being made; the Maid was brought to my houſe, whereupon obſerving and taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her kind of ſits, and having made ſome tryal upon her

by way of queſtions, and her anſwers, for ſhe could not ſay, or once name God, Jeſus Chriſt, or Deliver us from Evil, or the like but that immediately ſhe would be tormented, falling into ſtrange fits; whereupon, I told her Father, that ſhe was poſſeſſed by the Devil, and that it would be impoſſible to cure her, except the Devil were firſt caſt forth; I alſo adviſed him, to get one godly Miniſter or other to try what he could do by his means, and devotion; whereupon, and not before he told me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48251:75"/>
to loſe a ſack of Corn out of the Market: The man hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pitched his ſack down in the Market, and went away to ſet up his horſe, but before he returned, his ſack of Corn was ſtole, and no body could tell what became of it: at length un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that this Maid could tell any thing that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for any time paſt, he went to the ſaid Goodman <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Father of this Maid, deſiring him to uſe the means that ſo his Daughter might diſcover what became of his Corn, whereupon, the Mother of this Maid deſired her to tell this man, who had his Corn, and what became of it, and where it was at that inſtant: This Maid ſaid, that one, calling him by his name, had the Corn, and had ſet it under his ſtaires; the man that ſtole it, was a Porter that uſed to carry burthens in the Market, more eſpecially Corn, when it was bought or ſold. The man who loſt the Corn went preſently to the place afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, where he had his Corn accordingly. I could inſtance many more ſuch paſſages, but I ſuppoſe this one is enough for ſatisfaction herein. Now as concerning the way and method by me uſed, in caſting forth of both kinds of Devils; or evil Spirits before mentioned; I ſhall relate as followeth, (there are three principal cauſes or things conſiderable in caſting forth of Devils, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith, and the eſpecial gift of God thereupon, for except that you find that your Faith is ſtrong, its in vain to undertake this buſineſs:) Firſt, you muſt heartily pray that God would be pleaſed to give you this great gift, and to ſtrengthen your Faith, and to enable you to perform this great work: this was the ſubſtantial matter of my Prayer, as for matter of form I had none; the room being made in readineſs ſo cloſe as I could, I made a fume of three ſubſtantial matters, or things which, were Solary, which number three I conceived to be a moſt choice ſelect number for many perſons, and is attributed to the <hi>Sun,</hi> its the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the bleſſed Trinity, its alſo the number of time, <hi>viz.</hi> paſt, preſent and to come; alſo I conſidered, that the three wiſe men brought gifts unto Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold, Frankinſence, and Myrrh, which gifts are all of a Solary quality and vertue, and are under the dominion of the <hi>Sun,</hi> whereupon I made choice of the two latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Frankinſence and Myrrh, but inſtead of Gold I took Roſe-mary with theſe I made the fume, which I continued until the work was ended: I alſo oft times gave the Maid of the diſtilled waters of Marygolds, Roſemary, and Angelica, or ſuch like Solary plants, being all three under the dominion of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and gathered at the right planetary hours, when I firſt began, I laid my hand upon the Patient, but finding that ſhe, together with the Devil began to ſtrive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and ſo to get from me, ſhe being marvellous ſtrong, yet I held faſt, and deſired her Father (who was by me all the while I was about it) to help me, which he did, but for the moſt part I held her my ſelf, having gotten her at the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage I could: I often prayed, and repeated theſe words following, <hi>viz.</hi> by this high and mighty Power and Name <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> and in the name of the bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, I charge, and command the Devil and unclean Spirit to come forth of this Maid, and to depart from her in peace, and not to moleſt or trouble her any more; after this, when I ſaw that the unclean Spirit would not come forth, I ſaid three ſeveral times, <hi>In the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Nazareth I charge thee to come forth,</hi> yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (as yet) the Devil would not come forth: the truth is, I find that all Devils or evil Spirits, when once they are gotten into the poſſeſſion of any one will be very unwilling to come forth of their habitation; more eſpecially, when they have been long ſetled in the body: I often gave the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the diſtilled waters before mentioned, and then pray'd again as at the firſt; I alſo repeated thoſe words before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned oftentimes, reſolving not to give over until the Devil was inforced to leave her, and during the ſpace of above two hours I continued ſometimes in Prayer, and between whiles repeating the words over before rehearſed; at length the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill came forth but inviſible, with a great cry and hideous noiſe-rayſing a ſuddain guſt of wind, and ſo vaniſhed, doing no harm either to her Father (who was preſent all the while) nor yet to my ſelf, or any part of the houſe: her Father ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very fearful, and ſate trembling, (and truly I do not much blame him for I believe he was never preſent at any ſuch buſineſs before) but I cheared him up ſo well as I could, bidding him fear nothing, and willed him to truſt in God not doubting: the truth is, when I ſaw him ſo fearful I willed him to depart, telling him, that except he found that his Faith was ſtrong, and he throughly reſolved to indure the danger, cries noiſe, and trouble of it, he might unhappily interrupt me when I was moſt buſie; for he knew by what the Miniſter had done before, that we ſhould have ſome ſtrugling, but his anſwer was, that what ever came of it, he was reſolved to live and dye with his Child, rather than fail; whereupon I went on with the work, but before I had half done my task, he hearing, and ſeeing how grievouſly his Daughter was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, his Spirits and Faith began to fail him, deſiring me by all means to deſiſt, and give over; but I being very earneſt with him, and telling him of his breach of

promiſe, and uſing ſome arguments unto him, and telling him that except he would either ſit ſtill and not any more inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupt me, or otherwiſe depart the room, I would not meddle any further in the Cure, whereupon he reſolved to indure it, and promiſed me once more, that he would be ſilent until I had finiſhed, which accordingly he did perform; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Devil left her the Maid began to ſpeak, and he fitts never troubled her any more; and within a few weeks after, with Dyet-drinks, bathes and oyntments, this Maid was perfectly recovered both of her health, and limbs; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for a year paſt, ſhe could not move from the middle downwards, her limbs being uſeleſs, and of no ſtrength, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept during the time of her fits, and then ſometimes ſhe would be very ſtrong and at other times ſeemingly dead, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the mouth, ſometimes ſhe would ſhreek, cry, and groan, ſometimes crawle about the room, as in part I have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: I ſhall relate one paſſage more which happened, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the time of her fits, there was alwayes brought unto her three pins and but one at a time, at the receipt thereof ſhe ſeemed to rejoyce and ſmile, ſaying, <hi>ah</hi> and then preſantly ſhe would put the pin into her mouth, which when her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother perceived, they would inſtantly get it from her, fearing ſhe ſhould choak her ſelf with it; ſometimes they were much troubled to get it from her, for ſhe would be very unwilling to part with it; they ſhewed me a box near full of them for ſhe had three brought her every night during twelve moneths; and that night when I caſt the Devil forth of her ſhe had two brought her in my preſence but no more ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; alſo 'twas obſervable, that during the time that I was imployed about this buſineſs, there was ſeen by my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſervants three Women to walk about the houſe, and more eſpecially near the Window where I was imployed, which women her Father did judge were three ſuſpected witches, who had ſpake ſome words, and were afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by the Maids Father, one of them dyed, as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the Priſon in <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and weat became of the other two I knew not, for I never inquired more after them.</p>

               <head>I ſhall now proceed to ſet forth the way and manner how I did caſt forth a dumb Spirit out of one who was poſſeſſed, as followeth.</head>
               <p>THat which confirmed me and others of this Maid now in queſtion, of her being poſſeſſed of a Dumb Spirit, was in regard that ſhe could not ſay or once name God, Jeſus Chriſt, nor yet endure to pray, or ſuffer any one elſe either to pray, or repeat any Sacred words or expreſſions, but that immediately ſhe was tormented, and ſometimes would fall down dead: This Spirit would not anſwer to any queſtion as the other ſpeaking Devil did, not yet ſuffer the Maid: in her fits ſhe was alwayes dumb and ſilent, her fits uſually began about five a clock in the morning, and laſted four hours, during which time ſhe would not utter one word, but would ſometimes leap about with her arms and legs like a Frog, ſometimes ſhe would play cop-head, over and over; ſometimes with all the might ſhe had, ſhe would knock her head againſt the Beds-poſt or Wall, which was neareſt. Alſo being in a Chamber ſhe would ſtrive to get to the ſtairs that ſo ſhe might through her ſelf down. Now the way which I uſed to caſt forth this dumb Spirit, was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, In the firſt place the room being made ſo cloſe as I could with conveniency, I made a fume of ſuch ſolary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients as is before expreſſed; which fume I continued all the time I was in this action: the time which I took to caſt forth this dumb Spirit, or Devil, was between the hours of nine and twelve a clock upon the Sabbath day: the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which I uſed, was according unto what I have already related in caſting forth the ſpeaking Spirit; and likewiſe I oft repeated the ſame wayes as aforeſaid. But this dumb Spirit would not come forth until the third Sabbath day: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I was near three hours every time in action, &amp; during all the time I was implyed in this buſineſs, ſhe would be much afflicted; upon the third Sabbath day between the hours afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, this dumb Spirit came forth in a kind of vomit, no ſhape or form of any thing appearing, after which, by dyet drink and oyntment made of Planetary herbs, antipathetical to the afflicting Planet, ſhe was ſoon recovered and never had any more fits after the third Sabath day before mentioned. <hi>Note,</hi> That dumb Spirits are far more difficult to be caſt forth than thoſe which ſpeake: and that was the only reaſon why I took the benefit of thoſe hours upon each Sabbath
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48251:77"/>
day, it being the uſual hours of Prayer in all Churches, and Congregations.</p>
               <p>I know there are ſome fooliſh people, who being ignorant of the Scripture, that do, and will judge unrighteouſly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this great work, unleſs they are convinced, and truly I need not uſe any other arguments then what we find written by the holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, as firſt, the anſwer of our Bleſſed Saviour to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as is before mentioned. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we find that our Saviour gave that eſpecial gift unto his Apoſtles and Diſciples; and without queſtion unto all other Believing Chriſtians, who may through ſtrength of Faith do it; as appeareth in <hi>Mark</hi> Chap. 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. And when the Apoſtles told our Saviour <hi>that they did forbid ſome who did undertake to do it,</hi> our Saviour ſaid, <hi>forbid them not, &amp;c.</hi> But unto ſuch who preſume to do it who wanted Faith and did not Believe: nay, although they uſed the very words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, yet the Devil would not obey, nor yet be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth by them: as you may find in the 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, there you ſhall find, that one <hi>Sevah</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> had ſeven Sons who were exorciſts, or Conjurers, theſe following <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles, and hearing the words which they uſed, aſſayed to do the like, preſuming to caſt forth a Devil out of one who was poſſeſt, ſaying, <hi>I adjure you by Jeſus, whom Paul Preacheth to come forth,</hi> but the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Jeſus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye? and the man in whom the evil Spirit was, fell upon them, heat them and tore all the cloathes from their backs,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion put them into a great fright, for we find, that they all ſeven ran out of the houſe wounded, and naked, and glad (I warrant you) that they eſcaped ſo, this act of theirs was noiſed abroad, and alſo known throughout all the City of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and fear fell on them all, inſomuch, that I believe never any <hi>Jew</hi> durſt to attempt any ſuch thing afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day; for St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>Theſe Signes ſhall only follow thoſe that believe in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>: in his name ſhall they caſt out Devils; wherefore, unto thoſe who believe not in Chriſt Jeſus, it plainly appears they ſhall not do it. And whoſoever doth, or ſhall undertake this buſineſs, his faith and belief muſt be ſtrong without doubting, otherwiſe he may fail in the performance, for although ſome ceremonies may be uſed herein as I have before related, yet without Gods eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial bleſſing upon the words, wayes, and means uſed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſtrength of Faith, believing, no man can prevail herein, as plainly appeareth by thoſe ſeven Exorciſts, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers aforeſaid.</p>

I conſtantly find, that the Sign Aſcending, at or near the beginning of each fit, together with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48251:78"/>
its Lords doth exactly perſonate the ſick, and without doubt was their proper Aſcendant at their Birth, by vertue of which Aſcendant, together with the ſixth and twelfth houſes, and their Lords afflicted, I always diſcovered the grief, with its cauſe and termination: the truth is, except a Figure be ſet for either the time of Decumbiture, or firſt fit, or ſome other ſtrong fit, there can be no true diſcovery made from what cauſe it began, and if the true cauſe be not known, there can be no certainty in cure; for although the <hi>Moon</hi> in acute and the <hi>Sun</hi> in Chronick ſickneſſes by the Planets afflicting, doth generally diſcover each diſtemper with its cauſe, yet in theſe particular infirmities as Quotidian griefs before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I find by experience, that the fits have conſtantly kept their courſe, and have been very ſtrong when neither <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> have been afflicted, wherefore it appears, that the ſign or Conſtellation under which the Patient was born (which Sign we uſually call the Aſcendant) doth wholly reflect upon the Patient both at the beginning and durance of their daily fits aforeſaid; and truly I find even as in <hi>Quotidian</hi> Agues, and other infirmities aforeſaid, ſo likewiſe in Evils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Aſcendant doth uſually perſonate the ſick, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the fits are uſually near one hour, or at the time when the Patient undergoeth any ſtrong pain or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more then other; for ſuch is the ſubtilty of the Devil, that he knowing each bodies Aſcendant, can thereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtruct the <hi>Witch</hi> how to frame the Image, that ſo it may thereby work the ſtronger upon the Patient when the Sign aſcendeth, and by that means the <hi>Witch</hi> may by the rules of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> be the more eaſie diſcovered, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are thereby detected, for its well known unto many, that in a Philoſophical way when a Taleſman is framed for the deſtruction of vermine, as inſtance, the <hi>Scorpions,</hi> the way to make it is when the Sign <hi>Scorpio</hi> Aſcends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

longe continuance Fifthly, to cauſe the Patient to wear one or more Solary Plants: The way which I alwayes uſed, is as followeth, having by the Figure found under what Planet the Patient is moſt afflicted, as inſtance <hi>Mars,</hi> then take herbs under <hi>Venus</hi>; if under <hi>Saturn,</hi> then take herbs under <hi>Jupiter</hi>; if both <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> afflict, as ſometimes 'twill fall out, then let your herbs be under <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>; but if <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> be ſtrong in the Heavens, and more ſtrong than the fortunes <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> then their own herbs will do it; alwayes provided, that one of the ſmalleſt numbers of herbs under one or both the fortunes, together with herbs of the <hi>Sun</hi> be uſed together with the reſt; but if the infortunes be weak, then the ſmalleſt number attributed unto them, and the greater number of the fortunes together with a ſelect number of herbs under the <hi>Sun</hi> will do it, for the Dyet-drink you may together with the herbs, aforeſaid, add Raiſons, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Liquoriſh, Aniſeed, Sweet fennel-ſeed, or Coryander-ſeed, to make the Dyet-drink nutrative, as alſo more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and good to expel wind: the Dyet-drink is made by way of decoction and given to the Patient three times a day <hi>viz.</hi> morning, afternoon, and night: I have cured many only by Dyet-drink and herbs, ſuitable as aforeſaid, laid to the hand-wreſts, made up by way of Cataplaſm: The herbs which you lay to the hand-wreſts muſt be ſhred very ſmall and pounded in a Morter with Raiſons and white Salt, you may add a little <hi>Venus</hi>-Turpentine to make it hold together, you muſt uſe the quantity of two walnuts, it muſt be laid on hot and bound faſt to the hand-wreſt: if the Patient doth not mend after one or two fits tryal, then you muſt give the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a vomit, juſt when the fit doth begin as followeth: Take one dram of <hi>Stibium</hi> more or leſs according unto the ſtrength and age of the Patient, beat it into a very fine powder with a Peſtel and Morter, then warm a quarter of a pint of white wine and put the powder into it, keep this in a glaſs twenty four hours and ſhake it often, and when the Ague is ready to come put forth the wine into ſo much new milk, but leave the dregs behind and give it the Patient blood warme and let them take poſſet drink after every vomit, if the Patient doth not amend after one or two fits tryal, then you muſt let the patient blood, for after the Patient hath been afflicted above a Moneth 'twill get into the blood alſo, if need require you muſt give the Patient another vomit, more eſpecially, if the Ague have been of long continuance, and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been inforced to let blood more than once; you muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If they are by nature Sanguine, then they will be inclined unto mirth, as ſinging, dancing, and the like.

I have known ſometimes that an afright hath cauſed madneſs; in this condition applications muſt be chiefly to the brain, not omitting Dyet drink, made ſuitable by antipathy to their Complexion: I have known ſome Females who have been mad only by the ſtop of their monethly Courſe; the cure is by herbs proper to help ſuch infirmities, as you ſhall find in this book. I have known ſome women, who have fell mad after they have been delivered of their Child; occaſioned ſometime from great cold taken, or diſorderly dyet and ſometimes by Witchcraft as <hi>I</hi> have already declared, occaſioned by the Tender, or Nurſe; for their bodies being open and weak, any infirmities may the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier be wrought upon them by ſuch wretches, and yet the cauſe undiſcovered and the Patient many times dyeth.</p>
               <p>The worſt kind of madneſs that I know is occaſioned from Sorcery or Witchcraft; and I believe there are multitudes of this kind in <hi>Beathlaem,</hi> and elſewhere, that lye many years in this condition; for except the Witches power be taken off and ſtaid, its in vain to adminiſter Phyſick; more eſpecially, where the Witch ſometimes may have admittance to come to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient: others may perhaps be poſſeſſed, and then the Devil muſt be caſt forth; for (as I have ſaid already, except the true cauſe of each kinds of madneſs be diſcovered, its impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cure without a Miracle, except by accident; now to cure this kind of madneſs which cometh from Witchcraft: In the firſt place, you muſt by the Rules of Art, endeavour to afflict the Witch, and then by herbs antipathetical unto the afflicting Planet and complection of the Patient you muſt make Dyet-drinks Oyntments, and Gliſters, not omitting ſome ingredients ſuitable, as Figs, Raiſons, Currants, Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, Aniſeeds, or any other ſeeds good to expel wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; ſometimes when the body is bound, which moſt mad people are very ſubject unto; you muſt make choyce of ſuch herbs
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48251:83"/>
amongſt your Numbers which are Purging and loſening. <hi>Note</hi> that I alwayes found in my Practice, that the afflicting Planet and Complexion of the Patient were uſually one, as inſtance, Cholerick people are commonly afflicted of <hi>Mars,</hi> and Melancholy under <hi>Saturn</hi>; for ſuch is the ſubtilty of the Devil, and the Witches, that they ſtrike moſt upon that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour whereunto they find the nature of men and Women moſt prone, and apt to receive impreſſion</p>
               <p>If theſe Rules which <hi>I</hi> have inſerted, be well obſerved and followed, there is no one mad body whatſoever, but may (through Gods bleſſing) be recovered: to my knowledge <hi>I</hi> have not failed theſe many years where I have undertaken; notwithſtanding, ſome whom I have cured have been mad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years: but I muſt needs ſay, the longer they are mad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a right means is uſed, the more difficult the cure is, and ſomewhat the more time it will require to perfect their cure: For according unto that ſaying in Philoſophy, <hi>Cuſtom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a ſecond Nature,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <head>To all ſuch who are Students, and well-Willers unto this moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Science of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Preſume, that no ſooner are theſe following Books come forth, but ſome will be ready to ſay, What needs this Treatiſe, ſince we have ſo many books of this nature extant, written both ſo Learned and Copious even in our own Language that one would think, nothing more could be written of this Subject? but yet we know, that in all Arts and Sciences whatſoever, no man can ſo curiouſly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly write of any matter or thing, of what Nature ſoever, but that ſomething might be added thereunto; and were it but only a confirmation of what have been written formerly by other Authors, yet its but reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that ſuch perſons who have been Practitioners and Students in this Art, ſhould likewiſe have liberty to write their Knowledge and Experience herein: And although in general we keep cloſe unto one intire Method and Rule, as in our Introduction appears, compared with others, even as with young Scholars, ſo in this Science, there muſt be beginning or entrance at the firſt, after which, each induſtrious Student and Practitioner may increaſe in knowledge, and ſo make farther progreſs and diſcoveries herein; and having attained thereunto ſome perfection, may do well to communicate their knowledge unto others, that ſo this Art may continually be inlarged: we find that in
<pb facs="tcp:48251:84"/>
all Ages this Art hath ſtill increaſed, by means of thoſe Worthies who have been Students and Practitioners therein, whoſe Books are extant of this nature: I confeſs, in ſome material matters and circumſtances I differ from many Authors, yet I keep cloſe unto the Principles of Art, giving ſufficient reaſons for what I write; thoſe that read my Books, being compared with other Authors may follow that way and method (which by tryal) doth manifeſt its ſelf to be moſt effectual: I do not intend by this my vvriting, in the leaſt, to diſparage other vvorthy Authors, but do high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praiſe and extol thoſe excellent Works vvritten by our Learned and Ingenious Countrey-men, vvho have taken much pains in Demonſtrating the Art; only as I have already ſaid, vvhere there is a Continuance of Practice each ingenious perſon may vvithout doubt add ſomething to the increaſe of knovvledge; and I queſtion not, but that each Practitioner and young Student vvill gain ſomevvhat by my Labours herein. And as for ſuch vvho are vvell learned in this Art, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my vvriting may not adde much unto their knovvledge herein, yet in point of vviſdom and love to the Art and Artiſts I preſume they vvill take vvhat I have vvritten in good part, and paſs by my failings (if any) vvith ſilence: But as to the envious, they ſhall not much trouble me, conſidering their perſons vvill be ſufficiently revvarded, as being to themſelves moſt deſtructive. But unto ſuch vvho are loving and true lovers of the Art, I vviſh a bleſſing upon their Studies and that they may increaſe in knovvledge, <hi>Vale.</hi>
