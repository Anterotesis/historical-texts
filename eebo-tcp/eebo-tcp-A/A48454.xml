         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and to the comfort and encouragement of all the Saints, who, from the
conſideration of the ſweet ſupporting power of God, appearing to others
in their bonds, are the more encouraged publiquely to hold forth their
profeſſion of the truths of the Lord Ieſus with much more boldneſſe
and confidence, as knowing that that God which hath appeared to
others of the Saints in times of ſufferings, even before their eyes,
will alſo appeare to them in the like condition; and therefore wee

wicked in their owne ſnares, making the rage of man turne to his owne

To which I replied are you ſo? And for my owne part, I am not much

but it may be you may be deceived. Come (ſaith he) give us ſome wine,
and with that he ſwore an Oath, he would give me a quart of Sacke,
for joyfulneſſe of our meeting, and ſo he called for it and dranke to me:
And I told him, I would drinke no wine. To which hee replied, and
ſaid in theſe words: Come (ſaid he) be not ſad, you are but fallen into

and made me ſit downe by him, and put on my hat, and began with
me after this manner: Mr. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> what is your Chriſtian name? I
ſaid, <hi>Iohn,</hi> Did you live in <hi>London</hi> before you went into <hi>Holland?</hi> Yes,
that I did, Where? Neare <hi>Londonſtone.</hi> With whom there? With Mr.
<hi>Thomas Hewſon,</hi> What Trade is he? A dealer in Cloath, I told him.
How long did you ſerve him? About five yeares. How came you to
part? After this manner: I<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>But the greateſt ground was Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries malice, who ſent his Purſevants to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend me, for my viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of (and welwiſhing to) Noble Dr.</hi> Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke, which forced me to fly to ſave my ſelfe from thſe cruell blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers.</note> perceiving my Maſter had an intention to
deſiſt his Trade, I often moved him that I might have my liberty, to
provide for my ſelfe, and at the laſt hee condeſcended unto it;
and, ſo I went into the Country, to have the conſent of my
friends; and after that departed into <hi>Holland.</hi> Where were you there?
At <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> And from thence you went to <hi>Amſterdam?</hi> Yes, I was at
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> What <hi>Bookes</hi> did you ſee in <hi>Holland?</hi> Great ſtore of <hi>Bookes,</hi>
for in every <hi>Bookeſellers</hi> ſhop as I came in, there were greate ſtore of
Bookes. I know that, but I aske you, if you did ſee Dr. <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

them there, and if you pleaſe to goe thither, you may buy an hundred of
them at the <hi>Bookeſellers,</hi> if you have a minde to them Have you ſeene the

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96031:4"/>
But did you not ſend over ſome of theſe <hi>Bookes?</hi> I ſent
not any of them over. Doe you know one <hi>Harguſt</hi> there? Yes,
I did ſee ſuch a man. Where did you ſee him? I met with him one
day accidentally at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> How oft did you ſee him there?
Twiſe upon one day. But did not he ſend over <hi>Bookes?</hi> If he did, it is
nothing to me, for his doings is unknowne to me. But he wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

more than you. But did you ſee him no where elſe there? Yes, I ſaw
him at <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> What conference had you with him? Very little;
But why doe you aske me all theſe queſtions; Theſe are beſides the
matter of my impriſonment, I pray come to the thing for which I am

doe belong to the thing for which you are impriſoned. But doe you
know of any that ſent over any <hi>Bookes?</hi> What other men did, doth not
belong to me to know or ſearch into, ſufficient it is for me to looke

               </gap> you will not aske me about the

me of that, I ſhall then anſwer you, and doe anſwer, that for the thing
for which I am impriſoned: which is for ſending over Bookes, I am
cleare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I ſent none: And of any other matter that you have to accuſe
me of, I know it is warrantable by the Law of God, and I thinke by
the Law of the Land, that I may ſtand upon my juſt defence, and not
anſwer to your intergatorie; and that my accuſers ought to be brought
face to face, to juſtifie what they accuſe me of; And this is all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that for the preſent I am willing to make: And if you aske me of
any more things I ſhall anſwer you with ſilence. At this he was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
angry, and ſaid: There would be courſe taken with me to make
me anſwer, I told him I did not way what courſe they would take
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96031:5"/>
with me; onely this I deſire you to take notice of that I doe not refuſe
to anſwer out of any contempt but onely becauſe I am ignorant what
belongs to an examination, (for this is the firſt time that ever I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.)
and therefore I am unwilling to anſwer to any importinent
queſtions for feare that with my anſwer I may doe my ſelfe hurt. This
is not the way to get liberty. I had thought you would have anſwered
punctually, that ſo you might have beene diſpatched as ſhortly as might
be. So I have anſwered punctually to the thing for which I am impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and more I am not bound to anſwer, and for my liberty I muſt
waite Gods time. You had better anſwer, for I have two examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
where in you are accuſed Of what am I accuſed? <hi>Chillington</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
you for printing ten or twelve thouſands of Books in <hi>Holland,</hi> and
that they ſtand you in about eighty pound, and that you had a Chamber

that you would have printed the <hi>Vnmasking of the Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> if
you could have got a true Copy of it. I doe not beleeve that <hi>Chillington</hi>
ſaid any ſuch things and if he did, I know, and am ſure, that they are
all of them lies. You received money of Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ſince you came to
Towne, did you not? What if I did? It was for <hi>Bookes?</hi> I doe not ſay
ſo. For what ſorts of <hi>bookes</hi> was it? I doe not ſay it was for any, and I
have already anſwered you all, that for the preſent I have to anſwer and
if that will give you content, well and good, if not, doe what you pleaſe.
If you will not anſwer no more (here I told him if I had thought you
would have inſiſted upon ſuch impertinent queſtions, I would not
have given him ſo many anſwers) wee have power to ſend you to the
place from whence you came. You may doe your pleaſure, ſaid I. So
hee called in anger for my Keeper, and gave him aſtrict charge to
looke well to me. I ſaid they ſhould not feare my running away. And
ſo I was ſent down to Sir <hi>Iohn Bankes</hi> himſelf. And after that he had read
over what his man had writ, he called me in, and ſaid, I conceive you
are unwilling to confeſſe the Truth. No Sir, I have ſpoken the Truth
This is your Examination, is it not? What your man hath writ I
doe not know. Come neare and ſee that I read it right. Sir, I doe not
owne it for my Examination for your man hath writ what it pleaſed
him, and hath not writ my anſwer, for my anſwer was to him, and ſo
is to you that for the thing for which I am impriſoned (which is for
ſending over <hi>bookes</hi>) I am cleare, for I did not ſend any, and for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter that is laid to my charge. I know it is warrantable by the
Law of God, and I thinke by the Law of the Land, for me to ſtand
upon my juſt defence, and that my accuſers ought to be brought face to
face, to juſtifie what they accuſe me of And this is all that I have to ſay
for the preſent. You muſt ſet your hand to this your Examination. I
beſeech you Sir pardon me, I will ſet my hand to nothing but what I
have now ſaid. So he tooke the Pen and writ, the examined is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96031:5"/>
to anſwer to any thing but that for which hee is impriſoned. Now
you will ſet your hand to it? I am not willing in regard I doe not
owne that which your man hath writ, but if it pleaſe you to lend me the
Pen. I will write my Anſwer, and ſet my hand to it. So he gave mee
the Pen, and I begun to write thus: The Anſwer of me <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> is,
And here hee tooke the Pen from me, and ſaid he could not ſtay, that
was ſufficient. Then one of my Keepers asked him if they might have me
backe againe? And he ſaid yea: for he had no Order for my inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo I tooke my leave of him, and deſired the Lord to bleſſe
and keepe him, and came away.</p>
            <p>And then about ten or twelve dayes after, I was had forth to <hi>Grayes
Inne</hi> againe, but when I went, I did not know what they would doe
with me there: And when I came there, I was had to the <hi>Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
Office; and being there, as the Order is, I muſt enter my appearance,
they told me, I ſaid, to what, for I was never ſerved with any <hi>Subpoena;</hi>
neither was there any Bill preferred againſt me<note n="*" place="margin">No legall proceeding in Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> that I did heare of.
One of the <hi>Clarkes</hi> told me, I muſt firſt be examined, and then Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>
would make the Bill: it ſeemes they had no grounded matter againſt
me for to write a Bill, and therefore they went about to make me betray
my owne innocency, that ſo they might ground the Bill upon my
owne words: but my God ſhewed his goodneſſe to me, inkeeping me,
(a poore weake worme) that they could not in the leaſt intangle mee,
though I was altogether ignorant of the manner of their proceedings:
And at the entrance of my appearance, the <hi>Clarke</hi> and I had a deale of
pritty diſcourſe; the particulars whereof for brevity ſake I now preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
but in the concluſion he demanded mony of me for entring of my
appearance: and I told him I was but a young man, and a priſoner, and
money was not very plentifull with me, and therefore I would not
part with any money upon ſuch termes. At which anſwer the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wonder that I ſhould ſpeake ſo to him, and with that the whole
company of the <hi>Clarkes</hi> in the Office began to looke and gaze at me.
Well (ſaid he) if you will not pay your ſee, I will daſh out your name
againe. Doe what you pleaſe (ſaid I) I care not if you doe. So he made
a complaint to Mr. <hi>Goad,</hi> the Maſter of the Office, that I refuſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my appearance. And then I was brought before him, and he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of me what my buſineſſe was? I told him, I had no buſineſſe with
him, but I was a priſoner in the <hi>Fleete,</hi> and was ſent for but to whom
and to what end I doe not know, and therefore if he had nothing to ſay
to me, I had no buſineſſe with him. And then one of the <hi>Clarks</hi> ſaid, I
was to be examined. Then Mr. <hi>Goad</hi> ſaid, tender him the <hi>booke.</hi> So I
looked another way, as though I did not give eare to what he ſaid; and
then he bid me pull off my glove, and lay my hand upon the <hi>booke.</hi>
What to doe Sir? ſaid I. You muſt ſweare ſaid he. To what? <hi>That you</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Iuſt in quiſition like.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall make true anſwer to all things that is asked you,</hi> Muſt I ſo Sir? But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96031:6"/>
before I ſweare, I will know to what I muſt ſweare. As ſoone
as you have ſworne, you ſhall, but not before. To that I
anſwered. Sir, I am but a young man, and doe not well
know what belongs to the nature of an Oath, and therefore
before I ſweare, I will be better adviſed. Saith he, how old are you?
About twenty yeares old, I told him. You have received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have you not? Yes that I have. And you have heard the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
deliver Gods Word, have you not? Yes, I have heard Sermons.
Well then, you know the holy Evangeliſt? Yes that I doe. But Sir
though I have received the Sacrament, and have heard Sermons, yet it
doth not therefore follow that I am bound to take an Oath, which I
doubt of the lawfulneſſe of. Looke you here, ſaid he; and with that he
opened the <hi>booke,</hi> we deſire you to ſweare by no forraigne thing, but to
ſweare by the holy Evangeliſt. Sir, I doe not doubt or queſtion thatonely I queſtion how lawfull it is for me to ſweare to I doe not know
what. So ſome of the <hi>Clarks</hi> began to reaſon with me, and told me every
one tooke that Oath; and would I be wiſer than all other men? I
told them, it made no matter to me what other men doe; but before I
ſweare, I will know better grounds and reaſons than other mens pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
to convince mee of the lawfulneſſe of ſuch an Oath, to ſweare I
doe not know to what. So Mr. <hi>Goad</hi> bid them hold their peace, he was
not to convince any mans conſcience of the lawfulneſſe of it, but onely
to offer and tender it; Will you take it or no, ſaith he? Sir, I will be
better adviſed firſt; with this there was ſuch looking upon mee, and
cenſuring me for a ſingular man, for the refuſing of that which was
never refuſed before: whereupon there was a Meſſenger ſent to Sir <hi>Iohn
Bankes,</hi> to certifie him, that I would not take the <hi>Star-Chamber Oath.</hi> And
alſo to know of him what ſhould be done with me. So I looked I
ſhould be committed cloſe priſoner or worſe. And about an houre after
came Mr. <hi>Cockſchey,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> chiefe <hi>Clarke;</hi> what (ſaid he) Mr. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> it
ſeemes you will not take your Oath, to make true anſwer? I told him, I
would be better adviſed before I took ſuch an Oath. Well then (ſaith he)
you muſt<note n="*" place="margin">This is the Divinities of the Prelates and their Creatures.</note> goe from whence you came and then I ſpoke merrily to my
Keepers, and bid them, let us be gone, we have beene long enough here.
Thus have I made a true Relation of that dayes worke.</p>
            <p>But before I proceede, I deſire to declare unto you, the Lords good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
manifeſted unto me in being my counſellour and director in my
great ſtraights. The Prelates intendment towards me was carried ſo
cloſe, that I could not learne what they would doe with me, onely I
ſuppoſed they would have mee into the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> in regard I was
removed by the Lords of the Counſell; and alſo tidings was brought
unto me by ſome friends, what cruelty their Creatures did breath out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, but I incouraged my ſelfe in my God, and did not feare
what man could doe unto me. <hi>Eſay</hi>

good conſcience within me, and the aſſurance of Gods love reconciled
unto me in the precious blood of his Sonne JESVS CHRIST;
which was as good as Shield and Buckler unto me, to keepe off all the
aſſaults of my enemies, and I was, as it were, in a ſtrong walled Towne,
nothing dreading but lightly eſteeming the cruelty of my Adverſaries,
for I knew God was my God, and would be with me, and inable me
to undergoe whatſoever, by his permiſſion they could inflict upon me,
and to his praiſe I deſire to ſpeak it: I found his gracious goodneſſe and
loving kindnes ſo exceedingly made known unto me, that he enabled me
to undergoe my captivity with contentedneſſe, joyfulneſſe, and chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe:
And alſo was pleaſed, according to his promiſe, to be a mouth
unto me, whenſoever I was brought before them, and gave me courage
and boldneſſe to ſpeake unto them, his holy and bleſſed name be praiſed
and magnified for it.</p>
            <p>Vpon the Fryday next, after this, in the morning, one of the Officers
of the <hi>Fleete</hi> came to my Chamber, and bid mee get up and make mee
ready to goe to the <hi>Star-Chamber-barre</hi> forth with, I having no time to fit
my ſelfe, made me ready in all haſte to goe; (yet when I came there,
the Lord according to his promiſe was pleaſed to be preſent with me by
his ſpeciall aſſiſtance, that I was inabled without any dantedneſſe of

And then after I had obtained leave to ſpeake, I ſaid: My noble Lords,
as for that <hi>Affidavit,</hi> it is a moſt falſe lie, and untruth. Well, ſaid the
<hi>Lord-keeper,</hi> why will you not anſwer? My Honorable Lord (ſaid I)
I have anſwered fully, before Sir <hi>Iohn Bankes</hi> to all things that belongs to
me to anſwer unto, and for other things, which concerne other men, I
have nothing to doe with them. But why doe you refuſe to take the <hi>Star-Chamber
Oath?</hi> Moſt Noble Lord, I refuſed upon this ground, becauſe
that when I was examined, though I had fully anſwered all things that
belonged to me to anſwer unto, and had cleared my ſelfe of the thing
for which I am impriſoned, which was for ſending <hi>bookes</hi> out of <hi>Holland,</hi>
yet that would not ſatisfie and give content, but other things was put
unto me, concerning other men, to inſnare me, and get further matter
againſt me, which I perceiving refuſed, being not bound to anſwer to
ſuch things as doe not belong unto me; and withall I perceived the
Oath to be an Oath of inquiry; and for the lawfulneſſe of which Oath
I have no warrant, and upon theſe grounds I did, and doe ſtill refuſe the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96031:7"/>
Oath: with this ſome of the Kings Counſell, and ſome of the Lords
ſpoke, would I condemne and contradict the Lawes of the Land,<note n="*" place="margin">There is no Law in this Land for warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thu Oath.</note> and
be wiſer than all other men, to refuſe that, which is the Oath of the

he looked over his ſhoulder at me, &amp; bid me pull off my glove, and lay

then directing my ſpeech unto the Lords, I ſaid: Moſt Honorable and
Noble Lords, with all reverence and ſubmiſſion unto your Honours;
ſubmitting my body unto your Lordſhips pleaſure, and whatſoever
you pleaſe to inflict upon it yet muſt I refuſe the Oath. My Lords, ſaid
the <hi>Arch Prelate</hi> (in a deriding manner) doe you heare him, hee ſaith,

Noble Lords, with all willingneſſe I ſubmit my body unto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
pleaſure, but for any other ſubmiſſion, moſt Honourable Lords,
I am conſcious unto my ſelfe, that I have done nothing, that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a convention before this illuſtrious Aſſembly; and therefore for me
to ſubmit, is to ſubmit I doe not know wherefore. With that up ſtood
the Earle of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and ſaid: My Lords, this is one of their private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
Doe you heare him, how he ſtands in his owne juſtification?
Well my Lords, ſaid the great Prelate; this fellow (meaning me) hath
been one of the notoriouſeſt diſperſer of Libellous <hi>bookes</hi> that is in the
Kingdome, and that is the Father of them all (pointing to old Mr. <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.)</hi>
Then I replied, and ſaid, Sir, I know you are not able to prove,
and to make that good which you have ſaid. I have teſtimony of it, ſaid
he. Then ſaid I produce them in the face of the open Court, that wee
may ſee what they have to accuſe me of; And I am ready here to anſwer

that they had had him in<note n="*" place="margin">O cruell perſecutors</note> five ſeverall priſons within this two yeares,

refuſed to be examined upon Oath, and in regard that we refuſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

theirs were little better than Treaſon; but our crime was ſo farre

or any thing againſt the Law of the Land in them, yet we were but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedly
guilty, for the things were never fully proved againſt us; indeed
there was two Oathes read in court, which they ſaid was ſworne againſt
us by one man but he was never brought face to face, and in both his
Oathes he hath forſworne himſelfe, as in many particulars thereof wee
both are able to make good. In the concluſion, my <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> ſtood
up, and ſaid, My Lords, I hold it fit, that they ſhould be both for their
contempt committed cloſe priſoners till Tueſday next; and if they doe
not conforme themſelves betwixt this and then to take the Oath, and
yeeld to be examined before Mr. <hi>Goad,</hi> then that they ſhall be brought
hither againe, and cenſured, and made an Example;<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>O brave
Iuſtice.</hi>
               </note> Unto which they
all agreed; and ſo we were committed cloſe priſoners, and no friends
admitted to come unto us.</p>
            <p>And upon Munday after we were had to <hi>Grayes Inne,</hi> and I being
the firſt there, Mr. <hi>Goad</hi> ſaid to me, according to the Lords Order upon
Friday laſt, I have ſent for you to tender the Oath unto you. Sir, I
beſeech you, let me heare the Lords Order. So he cauſed it to be read
unto mee, and then tendered mee the <hi>Booke.</hi> Well Sir, ſaid I, I
am of the ſame minde I was, and withall I underſtand, that
this Oath is one and the ſame with the <hi>High Commiſsion Oath,</hi> which Oath
I know to be both againſt the Law of God, and the Law of the Land;
and therefore in briefe I dare not take the Oath, though I ſuffer death
for the refuſall of it. Well, ſaid he, I did not ſend for you to diſpute
with you about the lawfulneſſe of it, but onely according to my place
to tender it unto you. Sir I dare not take it, though I looſe my life for
the refuſall of it. So he ſaid, he had no more to ſay to me; and I tooke
my leave of him and came away. And after that came the <hi>old Man,</hi> and
it was tendered unto him, which he refuſed to take: (and as he hath
told me) he declared unto him how the Biſhops had him eight times
in priſon for the refuſall of it, and he had ſuffered the Biſhops mercileſſe
cruelty for many yeares together, and he would nownever take it as long
as he lived; and withall told him, that if there were a Cart ready at the
doore to carry him to <hi>Tiburne,</hi> he would be hanged, before ever hee
would take it. And this was that dayes buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Upon the next morning about ſeven a clocke, we were had to the
<hi>Star-Chamber-bar</hi> againe to receive our Cenſure; and ſtood at the <hi>Bar</hi>
about two boures before Sir <hi>Iohn Bancks</hi> came; but at the laſt hee began
his accuſation againſt us, that we did ſtill continue in our former ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneneſſe:
and alſo there was another <hi>Affidavit</hi> of the foreſaid <hi>Edmond
Chillingtons</hi> read againſt us; the ſumme of which was, that I had confeſſed
to him, that I had printed Dr. <hi>Baſtwickes Anſwer</hi> to Sir <hi>Iohn Bancks</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and his <hi>Letany;</hi> and an other <hi>booke,</hi> called, <hi>An Anſwer unto
certaine Objections;</hi> and another <hi>booke</hi> of his, called <hi>the Vanitie and Impiety
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96031:8"/>
of the old Letany;</hi> and that I had divers other <hi>bookes</hi> of Dr. <hi>Baſtwickes</hi> a
Printing; and that Mr. <hi>Iohn Wharton</hi> had beene at the charges of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a <hi>booke</hi> called <hi>A breviate of the Biſhops late proceedings;</hi> and an other
<hi>booke,</hi> called <hi>Sixteene new Quertes,</hi> and divers other factious <hi>bookes;</hi> and
that one <hi>James Ouldam,</hi> a Turner in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> had diſperſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of theſe <hi>bookes.</hi> So it came to me to ſpeake; and I ſaid after this
manner: Moſt Noble Lords, I beſeech your Honours, that you would
be pleaſed to give me leave to ſpeake for my ſelfe, and to make my juſt
defence; and I ſhall labour ſo to Order my ſpeeches, as that I ſhall not
give your Honours any juſt diſtaſte; and withall ſhall doe it with as
much brevitie as I can. So having obtained my deſire, I began, and
ſaid, My Lords, it ſeemes there was divers <hi>bookes</hi> ſent out of <hi>Holland,</hi>
which came to the hands of one <hi>Edmond Chillinton,</hi> which made this <hi>affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit</hi>
againſt us: and as I underſtand, he delivered divers of theſe <hi>bookes</hi>
unto one <hi>Iohn Chilliburne,</hi> ſervant to this <hi>old Man</hi> Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> (I, ſaid he,
my Lords, and I had given him a ſtrict charge, that he ſhould not meddle
with any,) and his Maſter being in Priſon, he diſperſed divers of them
for the foreſaid <hi>Chillingtons</hi> uſe, whereupon the <hi>bookes</hi> were taken in his
Cuſtody, and he being found diſperſing of them, gos to one <hi>Smith,</hi> a <hi>Taylor</hi>
in Bridewell (as I am informed) &amp; deſires him to get his peace made with
the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whereupon he covenants with ſome of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Creatures,
to betray me into their hands, being newly come out of <hi>Holland,</hi> which
(as he ſaid) did ſend over theſe <hi>bookes.</hi> So my Lords, he having purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his owne libertie, layes the plot for betraying me, and I was taken
by a Purfevant and foure others of his aſſiſtance, walking in the ſtreets
with the foreſaid <hi>Iohn Chilliburne,</hi> who had laid and contrived the plot
before (as I am able to make good) and the next morning I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Sir <hi>Iohn Lamb</hi> to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> (now my Lords, I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
before your Honours in the word of a Chriſtian that I did not ſend
over thefe <hi>bookes,</hi> neither did J know the Ship that brought them, nor
any that belongs to the ſhip, nor to my knowledge did never ſee with
my eyes, either the ſhip, or any that belongs unto it.</p>
            <p>(But before I proceede with my Speech, I deſire to digreſſe a little, in
regard that <hi>Iohn Chilliburne</hi> doth yet ſtifly maintaine, that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
me, nor laid the plot, and therefore I doe him wrong for accuſing
him, he ſaith. To which I anſwer, and ſay, in this, he is worfe than <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
himſelfe; for after he had betrayed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he came and confeſſed his
ſinne, and ſaid; I <hi>have ſinned in betraying the innocent blood;</hi> and this man
hath betraied <hi>Chriſt</hi> in betraying me his member, for what is done to
his ſervant, he takes it as done to himſelfe: but he is not ſo good as <hi>Iudas,</hi>
who confeſſed his fault, but he hides and juſtifies his ſinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will declare my Grounds and Demonſtrations, whereupon I am
ſure he was the <hi>Judas:</hi> The firſt is thus, He and I appointed to meete
one day upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> at] two a clocke, unto which place I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96031:8"/>
came, and ſtaid long for his comming, but hee came not: and I verily
thinke, he ſent two or three in his place, two of them being <hi>Arminians,</hi>
living in <hi>Cornehill,</hi> which J my ſelfe knew, who paſſed againe and again
by me, vewing very narrowly my apparell, viſage and countenance, as
J thinke for that end that they might know mee againe: and when J
ſat downe, they would paſſe by, and goe a little from me, and ſit downe
and fix their eyes upon me, inſomuch that J was afraid that J ſhould
there have beene taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which forced me to depart. And at our next
meeting J told him of it, and how that (unleſſe J had knowne him
well) J ſhould have beleeved he had betrayed me. Unto which hee
gave me no ſatisfactory anſwer, but put it off, and ſaid his libertie was
as precious as mine; and if he ſhould betray me, he muſt betray him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and therefore J needed not to doubt any ſuch thing: the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
blinded my eyes; J could not ſee into his treacherous heart, but
tooke this for a currant anſwer, J knowing that he had had a deepe hand
in the diſperſing of <hi>bookes,</hi> and therefore J gave credite to that which he
had ſaid, as being a reall Truth, the Lord having a ſecret hand of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in it, (J hope at the laſt for his glorie and my good) did ſo Order it,
that I ſhould not take notice, or perceive his perfidiouſneſſe, though I had
an incling given me of it before by ſome friends, yet J could not beleeve
it, till the event manifeſted it, for that day J was taken, he hearing (by
what meanes I doe not know) that I was to meete one at the <hi>Temple,</hi>
and underſtanding that I had a deſire to ſee his Maſter at his owne
houſe (being newly let out of priſon) we came towards the <hi>Temple,</hi> and
met me in <hi>Fleet-ſtreete,</hi> and ſo we went backe towards the <hi>Temple,</hi> and
had ſome diſcourſe there, in which he put me forward to goe ſee and
ſpeake with his Maſter, unto whom I declared, how fearefull I was
to goe thither (in regard I heard they laid waite for me) leaſt I ſhould
be taken; but he made all things cleare, and contrived a way, by
meanes of which he ſaid, I might without any feare goe ſpeake
with him. So we parted, and appointed to meete at the ſtaires
that goes from <hi>Bridewell to Black-Fryers.</hi> I came to the Staires, and
ſtood a great while, but he came not, till I was a comming away;
and I expecting him to come out of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> I having ſent him in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to ſpeake with one, unto whom I thinke he did not goe, but yet he
told me, he was with him; but rather he went to <hi>Flamſted</hi> the Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to get him in a readineſſe, for he came to me from <hi>Flamſteds-houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
downe from <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> being a cleane contrary way to that I
ſent him. So we went towards his Maſters houſe, and parted againe,
and appointed to meet at <hi>Tantlins-Church;</hi> and when I came there, I ſaw
one walking with him, which I verily beleeve was one of the five that
tooke me; and when I came to him, I declared unto him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
downe <hi>Soper-lane,</hi> I ſaw a fellow ſtand in a corner, very ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
who looked very wiſhfully at me, and I at him; and therefore I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96031:9"/>
deſired him to goe, and ſee who it was, and whether I might goe ſafely
to his Maſters or no. So he went, and came backe, and told me his
Maſter was come to the doore, and I might goe without any danger,
and as we went, I declared unto him my fearefulneſſe, to goe to his
Maſters; and I told him, I would halfe draw my ſword, that I might
be in a readineſſe; and he went before towards his Maſters; and I doe
verily thinke acquainted them how it was with me; and I going after
him in the narrow Lane, I paſſed by two great fellowes, ſuſpecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and by and by they ſeazed upon my backe and ſhoulders, and
cried out in the Kings Name for helpe, they had taken the Rogues
<hi>Whartons</hi> men, and <hi>Iohn</hi> was the third man that ſeized upon me, laying
faſt hold of my left ſhoulder, and they three pulled my cloake croſſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my armes, that ſo, though I had my ſword halfe drawne, yet by no
meanes could I get it out; which if I had, and got my backe againſt
the wall, I doe not doubt but I ſhould have made them be willing to
let me alone; for though they had faſt hold of me, they quaked and
trembled for feare; and though they were five or ſixe, yet they cryed out
for more helpe to aſſiſt them. I being but one, and when they all ſeaſed
on me, then they called me by my name, and though we were in the
darke, yet they knew my habit, that I was in as well as my ſelfe, and
ſhewed me their warrant with my name in it. I have beene forced of
neceſſity to recite theſe things in regard of his dayly ſpeeches againſt me,
and his writing to me in juſtification of his innocency though as yet,
for all I have ſent for him, hee would never come face to face: Tart
Letters likewiſe I have received from <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Chillington,</hi> for ſpeaking
that which I have ſaid in publique of them: and as for <hi>Smith,</hi> take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
what I ſaid of him; and I here give my reaſons for that I ſaid, it is
knowne that at the laſt time the <hi>bookes</hi> were taken at Mr. <hi>Whartons,</hi> part
of them was not taken; which <hi>Iohn</hi> can not deny, but he carried them
unto <hi>Smith;</hi> and what paſſed betwixt them, they themſelves beſt know:
but this is ſure, <hi>Iohn</hi> was never troubled for the <hi>bookes,</hi> though hee was
taken diſperſing of them; and I am ſure, his libertie was obtained by
<hi>Smiths</hi> and <hi>Sam, Bakers</hi> the Prelate of <hi>Londons</hi> Chaplaines meanes. Alſo
<hi>Smith</hi> is not ignorant, but doth very well know that promiſe that <hi>Iohn</hi>
made to Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> about twelve moneths agoe, to doe him ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
about ſuch things, which promiſe I doe verily beleeve he hath
faithfully kept; for he hath confeſſed to his Maſter ſince the beginning
of my trouble, that he hath uſed to carry to <hi>Baker</hi> all new <hi>bookes</hi> he could
get, as ſoone as they came out, and how for the which he gave him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but how much he beſt knowes.</p>
            <p>Alſo, what free and ſamiliar acceſſe <hi>Iohn</hi> hath had to him, and he and
<hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Baker,</hi> and for thoſe ſecrets which <hi>Iohn</hi> from time to time hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to him and <hi>Baker,</hi> what they are I name not, but appeale to their
owne conſciences: for it is too manifeſt that hee is a darling both to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96031:9"/>
               <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Baker,</hi> in regard they ſtand ſo ſtoutly for him as they doe;
for Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> being not long ſince with <hi>Baker,</hi> he told him hee heard
he was about to put away his Man <hi>Iohn.</hi> Yea (ſaid he) what ſhould I
do with him elſe? Well (ſaid he) if you doe it, and put him away, the
Chamberlaine will make you take him againe. Will he ſo (ſaid he) he
can not doe it, for he is a <hi>Iudas,</hi> and a Theefe, for he hath ſtolne money
from me, and I can prove it ſaid the <hi>Old Man;</hi> and therefore he can not
make me take him againe. <hi>Baker</hi> could not well tell what to ſay to it;
but yet did perſwade him to keepe him.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Old man</hi> told me himſelfe, it ſeemes they have kept him at his
Maſters, as a private and ſecret ſervant for their owne turnes above this
fourteene Moneths and they would ſtill, if they could keepe him there.
But what ſecret miſchiefe hee hath done by his ſo frequent reſorting to
<hi>Baker</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> is not yet fully knowne, but I hope it will come out by
degrees: Therefore, let all that heares of it take notice of it, and let ſome
of thoſe that were in the information with the three Worthies, caſt back
their eyes and ſee if they can finde and ſpie out who was their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Accuſer and Betrayer. Theſe things may be worth the making
knowne, though I may incurre hatred and ſpite from them for it, yet I
weigh not that, for I have not declared theſe things out of any revenge,
for I commit that unto God.</p>
            <p>And for that wrong they have done unto mee, I freely forgive
them; and if any of them belong to God, I pray him to call them home
unto him. But theſe things I have ſet downe, being forced thereunto
for vindicating my good name from their bitter reproaches and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations,
and all you that read this, judge and cenſure what I have ſaid.
But now after my Digreſſion I will returne againe to our former
matter.</p>
            <p>And being at the Gatehouſe I was removed by (ſixe of your <hi>Honours</hi>)
to the <hi>Fleete,</hi> at which time the ſaid <hi>Chillington</hi> was removed from <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and being kept<note n="*" place="margin">And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtarved.</note> cloſe there: then he by their threats and
perſwaſions and the procuring of his owne liberty, goes and accuſes me
for printing ten or twelve thouſand <hi>Bookes</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> And at my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
before Sir <hi>Iohn Bankes</hi> I cleared my ſelfe of that, and upon
Fryday laſt he made an <hi>Affidavit</hi> againſt me, in which hee hath moſt
falſly forſworne himſelfe, and to day he hath made another, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a moſt falſe untruth: And withall my Lords, he is knowne to be a
notorious lying fellow, and hath accuſed mee for the purchaſing of his
owne liberty, which he hath got. And therefore, I beſeech your Honours,
to take into your ſerious conſideration, and ſee whether I am to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
upon ſuch a fellowes <hi>Affidavits</hi> or no. Then ſaid the Lord Keeper,
thou art a mad fellow, ſeeing things are thus, that thou wilt not take
thine Oath, and anſwer truely. My Honourable Lord I have declared
unto you the reall Truth, but for the Oath, it is an Oath of Inquiry, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96031:10"/>
of the ſame nature of the High-Commiſſion-Oath; Which Oath I
know to be unlawfull; and withall, I finde no warrant in the Word
of God, for an Oath of Inquiry, and it ought to be the director of mee
in all things that I doe, and therefore my Lords at no hand, I dare not
take the Oath (when I named the Word of God, the Court began to
laugh, as though they had had nothing to doe with it) my Lords (ſaid
Mr. <hi>Goad</hi>) he told me yeſterday, he durſt not take the Oath, though he
ſuffered death for the refuſall of it. And with that my Lord <hi>Privy Seal</hi>
ſpoke: Will you (ſaid he) take your Oath, that that which you have
ſaid is true? My Lord (ſaid I) I am but a young Man, and doe not well
know what belongs to the nature of an Oath (but that which I have, ſaid
is a reall truth) but thus much by Gods appointment, I know an Oath
ought to be the end of all controverſie and ſtrife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. And if it
might be ſo in this my preſent cauſe, I would ſafely take my Oath, that
what I have ſaid is true. So they ſpoke to the <hi>Old man</hi> my fellow
partner, and asked him whether he would take the Oath. So he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them to give him leave to ſpeake; and he begun to thunder it out
againſt the Biſhops, and told them they required three Oathes of the
Kings Subjects; namely, the Oath of Churchwardenſhip, and the
Oath of Canonicall Obedience, and the Oath <hi>Ex Officio;</hi> Which (ſaid
he) are all againſt the Law of the Land, and by which they deceive and
perjure thouſands of the Kings Subjects in a yeare. And withall, my
Lords, (ſaid he) there is a Maxime in Divinity, that we ſhould prefer
the glory of God, the good of our King and Country, before our owne
lives: but the Lords wondering to heare the <hi>Old Man</hi> begin to talke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner, commanded him to hold his peace, and to anſwer
them, whether he would take the Oath or no? To which he replied,
and deſired them to let him talke a little, and he would tell them by
and by. At which all the Court burſt out of a laughing; but they
would not let him goe on, but commanded ſilence, which if they
would have let him proceed, he would ſo have peppered the Biſhops as
they were never in their lives in an open Court of <hi>Iudicature.</hi> So they
asked us againe, whether we would take the Oath? which we both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
refuſed; and withall I told them, that for the reaſons before I
durſt not take it. Then they ſaid, they would proceed to Cenſure. I
bid them doe as they pleaſed, for I knew my ſelfe innocent of the thing
for which I was impriſoned and accuſed; but yet notwithſtanding did
ſubmit my body to their Honours pleaſure. So they cenſured us 500.
pound a peece; and then ſtood up Judge <hi>Ioans,</hi> and ſaid: It was fit, that
I being a young man for example ſake, ſhould have ſome-corporall
<note n="*" place="margin">So my youth was the cauſe of my whipping by Iudge <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ones</hi> his Law.</note> puniſhment inflicted upon me. So my Cenſure was to be whipt, but
neither time nor place allotted. And for the <hi>Old Man,</hi> in regard of his
age, being 85. yeares old, they would ſpare his corporall puniſhment,
though (ſaid they) hee deſerves it as well as the other (meaning me)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96031:10"/>
yet he ſhould ſtand upon the Pillory; but I could not underſtand or
perceive by Cenſure, that I was to ſtand upon the Pillory. So we tooke
our leaves of them. And when I came from the <hi>Bar,</hi> I ſpoke in an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
voice, and ſaid: My Lords, J beſeech God to bleſſe your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and to diſcover and make knowne unto you the wickedneſſe
and cruelty of the Prelates.</p>
            <p>So here is an end of my publike proceedings, as yet, which I have had
ſince I came into my troubles, the Lord ſanctifie them unto me, and
make me the better by them, and put an end to them in his due time, and
make way for my deliverance, as I hope he will.</p>
            <p>After our Cenſure we had the libertie of the priſon for a few dayes;
but the <hi>Old Man,</hi> my fellow partner, went to the <hi>Warden of the Fleete;</hi>
and told him the ſumme of that which he intended in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi>
to have ſpoken againſt the Biſhops, if the Lords would have let him; So
he told the <hi>Warden,</hi> how the Biſhops were the greateſt Tyrants that ever
were ſince <hi>Adams</hi> Creation; and that they were more crueller than the
<hi>Cannibals,</hi> thoſe Men-eaters, for (ſaid he) they preſently devouted men,
and put an end to their paine, but the Biſhops doe it by degrees, and are
many yeares in exerciſing their cruelty and tyranny upon thoſe that
ſtand out againſt them; and therefore are worſe than the very <hi>Canibals;</hi>
(and in this he ſaith very true, for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſaith: <hi>They that be
ſlaine with the Sword, are better than they that be ſlaine with Hunger;</hi> and he
gives the reaſon of it: <hi>For thoſe pine away, ſtriken through, for want of the
fruits of the field, Lamen.</hi> 4. 9 Whereas thoſe that are ſlaine out-right, are
ſoone out of their paine;) and ſaid he, they have perſecuted mee
about forty yeares, and caſt mee into eight ſeverall Priſons;
and all to undoe me, and waſte my eſtate, that ſo I might not be
worth a penny to buy me meate, but ſtarve in priſon, for want of food,
and yet were never able to lay any thing to my charge, that I had done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt Gods Law, or the Law of the land; and (ſaid he) they are the
wickedeſt men that are in the Kingdome; and I can prove them (ſaith
he) to be enemies of God, and of the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and of the King
and Common-wealth; Or elſe I will be willing to looſe my life; and
alſo told him that they did thruſt the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> out of his Prieſtly,
Propheticall and Kingly Offices, and hath ſet up a will worſhip of their
owne invention, contrary to the Holy Scriptures; and that they led by
their wicked practiſes the greater halfe of the Kingdome to Hell with
them; and that they rob the King of a million of money in
a yeare, and the ſubjects of as much by their powling, ſinfull wicked
Courts; and that their living by which they lived was got by<note n="*" place="margin">Very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</note> lying
and cozning of poore ignorant Children; for (ſaid he) the Pope and the
Prieſt did promiſe the Children of deceaſed Parents, if they would give
ſo much to the Church, they would pray their Parents out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
and ſo cozened them of their eſtates; &amp; (ſaid he) by ſuch diſſemblings and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96031:11"/>
cozening wayes and meanes, as this, were their livings at the firſt raiſed,
Yea, but Sir, (ſaith the <hi>Warden</hi>) what is that to them, that was in time
of Popery? Yea, but Sir, (ſaid he) their livings hath continued ever
ſince, and they live ſtill to this day upon the ſweetneſſe and fatneſſe of
them.</p>
            <p>This and much more he then told the <hi>Warden,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi>
himſelfe ſince then hath told me. And there being a Papiſt with foure or
five more in the roome, the <hi>Warden</hi> ſaid; <hi>Papiſt</hi> come hither, and heare
what the <hi>Old Man</hi> ſaith. So it came to the Lords of the Counſels eares,
whereupon we were the next Munday after brought both together and
locked upcloſe priſoners in one <hi>Chamber,</hi> without any Order or Warrant
at all, but only <hi>Warden</hi> INGRAMS bare Command and Pleaſure.
But the <hi>Old Man,</hi> about three weekes after, made a Petition to the Lords
of the Counſell, that he might have ſome liberty, and being very weake,
more likely to dye than to live, hee had his libertie granted till the
Tearme; but I doe ſtill remaine cloſe Priſoner; but for my owne part,
I am as cheerefull and merry, and as well contented with my preſent
condition (in regard I ſee the over-ruling hand of my good God in it)
as ever I was with any condition in my life, I bleſſe his holy name for it;
for in all my troubles I have had ſuch ſweete and comfortable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from my God, that though my impriſonment, and thoſe ſtraights
that I have beene in, might ſeeme to the World, to be a great and heavy
burthen, yet to me it hath beene a happy condition, and a cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

notice of the execution of my Cenſure, till this
preſent morning, I prepared my ſelfe by prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, that he would make good his promiſe, to be
with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enable me to undergoe my affliction
with joyfulneſſe and courage: and that hee would
be a mouth and utterance unto me to enable me to
ſpeake that which might make for his greateſt honour. And in my
Meditations my ſoule did principally pitch upon theſe three places of
Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That in <hi>Eſay 41. 10. 11. 12. 13. Feare thou not, for I am with thee,
be not diſmaid, for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will helpe thee,
yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſſe. Behold all they
that were incenſed againſt thee ſhall be aſhamed and confounded, they ſhall be as
nothing, and they that ſtrive with thee ſhall periſh, Thou ſhalt ſeeke them, and
ſhalt not find them, even them that contended with thee, they that warre againſt
thee ſhall be as nothing, and as a thing of naught. For the Lord thy God will hold
thee by thy right hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying unto thee, feare not, I will helpe thee, Feare not thou

redeemer the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that place in <hi>Eſay</hi> 43. 1. 2. Where God ſpeakes thus to his
Elect. <hi>Feare not, for I have redeemed thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have called thee by thy name, thou

            <p>Thirdly, that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. 6. In theſe words, <hi>For he hath ſaid I will

            <p>With the conſideration of theſe and other gracious promiſes, made
to his people. I being one of his choſen ones, did claime my ſhare and
intereſt in them, and the Lord of his infinite goodneſſe enabled me to
caſt my ſelfe upon, and reſt in them, knowing and ſtedfaſtly beleeving
that he is a God of faithfulneſſe and power, who is able and willing to
make good theſe his promiſes to the utmoſt, and (to his praiſe be it
ſpoken, I deſire to ſpeake it) my ſoule was that morning exceedingly
lifted up with ſpirituall conſolation: and I felt within me ſuch a divine
ſupportation, that the baſeneſſe of my puniſhment. I was to undergoe
did ſeeme as a matter of nothing to me. And I went to my ſuffering
with as willing and joyfull a heart as if I had been go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

with all willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe, whereupon the Executioner
tooke out a cord and tied my hands to the Carts-Arſe, which cauſed
me to utter theſe words, <hi>Welcome be the Croſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With that there drew neere a young man of my acquaintance, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96031:12"/>
bid me put on a couragious reſolution to ſuffer cheerefully, and not to
diſhonour my cauſe, for you ſuffer (ſaid he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a good cauſe I gave him
thanks for his Chriſtian encouragement, I replying I know the cauſe is
good <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is Gods cauſe, and for mine owne part, I am cheerfull and
merry in the Lord, and am as well contented with this my preſent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as if I were to receive my preſent liberty: For I know my God
that hath gone along with me hitherto, will carry me through to the
end. And for the affliction it ſelfe, though it be the puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon Rogues, yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I eſteeme it not the leaſt diſgrace, but the
greateſt honour that can be done unto mee, that the Lord counts mee
worthy to ſuffer any thing for his great Name.</p>
            <p>And you my brethren that doe now here behold my preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not diſcouraged, be not diſcouraged at the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
by reaſon of the Croſſe that accompanies it, for it is the lot and
portion of all which will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, to ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
            <p>The Cart being ready to goe forward, I ſpake to the Executioner
(when I ſaw him pull out his Corded whip out of his pocket) after
this manner; Well, my friend, doe thy office; to which he replyed, I
have whipt many a Rogue, but now I ſhall whip an honeſt man, but
be not diſcouraged (ſaid hee) it will be ſoone over.</p>
            <p>To which I replyed, I know my God hath not onely enabled me
to believe in his Name, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake. So the Carman
drove forward his Cart, and I laboured with my God for ſtrength to
ſubmit my backe with cheerfulneſſe unto the ſmiter, and he heard my
deſire, and granted my requeſt; for when the firſt ſtripe was given, I
felt not the leaſt paine, but ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be thy Name, O Lord my God, that
haſt counted mee worthy to ſuffer thy glorious Names ſake;</hi> and at the giving
of the ſecond, I cryed out with a loud voyce, <hi>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Glory,
Honour and Praiſe be given to thee, O Lord, for ever, and to the Lambe that ſits
upon the Throne.</hi> So wee went up to <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> the Lord enabling me to
endure the ſtripes with ſuch patience and cheerefulneſſe, that I did not
in the leaſt manner ſhew the leaſt diſcontent at them, for my God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
my backe and ſteeled my reynes, and tooke away the ſmart and
paine of the ſtripes from mee.</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſſe, if I had had no more but mine owne naturall
ſtrength, I had ſunke under the burthen of my puniſhment; for to the
fleſh the paine was very grievous and heavie, but my God in whom I
did truſt, was higher and ſtronger than my ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſtrengthened and
enabled mee not onely to undergoe the puniſhment with cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
but made mee triumph, and with a holy diſdaine, to inſult over
my torments.</p>
            <p>And as wee went along the <hi>Strand,</hi> many friends ſpoke to mee and
asked how I did, and bid me be cheerfull, to whom I replied I was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96031:13"/>
and cheerfull, and was upheld with a divine and heavenly ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
comforted with the ſweet conſolations of Gods Spirit. And about
the middle of the <hi>Strand,</hi> there came a friend, and bid mee ſpeake with
boldneſſe; to whom I replied, when the time comes ſo I will; for
then if I ſhould have ſpoken and ſpent my ſtrength, it would have been
but as water ſpilt on the ground, in regard of the noyſe and preſſe of
people: And alſo at that time I was not in a ſit temper to ſpeake;
becauſe the duſt much troubled me, and the Sunne ſhined very hot
upon mee; and the tipſtaffe-man at the firſt would not let me have
my hat to keepe the vehement heate of the Sunne from my head:
Alſo hee many times ſpake to the Cart-man to drive ſoftly, ſo that the
heate of the Sunne exceedingly pierced my head, and made me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
faint. But yet my God upheld mee with courage, and made mee
undergoe it with a joyfull heart: And when I came to <hi>Chearing Croſſe,</hi>
ſome <hi>Chriſtian friends</hi> ſpake to me, and bid me be of good cheere; ſo I
am (ſaid I) for I reſt not in mine owne ſtrength, but I fight under the
Banner of my great and mighty Captaine, <hi>The Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who
hath conquered all his Enemies, and I doubt not but through his
ſtrength I ſhall conquer and overcome all my ſufferings for his power
upholds me, his ſtrength enables mee, his preſence cheeres mee, and his
Spirit comforts me, and I looke for an immortall crowne, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall fade nor decay; the aſſured hope and expectation whereof
makes mee to contemne my ſufferings, and count them as nothing;
for my momentany affliction will work for me a farre more exceeding
crowne and weight of glory. And as I went by the Kings Palace, a
great multitude of people came to looke upon me; and paſſing through
the gate unto <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> many demanded what was the matter.</p>
            <p>To whom I replyed, My brethren, againſt the Law of God, againſt
the Law of the Land, againſt the King or State have I not committed
the leaſt offence that deſerves this puniſhment, but onely I ſuffer as an
object of the Prelates crueltie and malice; and hereupon one of the
<hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleets-officers,</hi> began to interrupt inee, and tols me my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
were juſt, and therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould hold my tongue; whom I
bid meddle with his owne buſineſſe, for I would ſpeake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come what
would, for my cauſe is good for which I ſuffered, and here I was ready
to ſhed my deareſt blood for it.</p>
            <p>And as wee went through <hi>Kings-ſtreet,</hi> many encouraged mee, and
bid mee be cheerfull; others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe faces (to my knowledge) I never
ſaw before, and who, I verily thinke, knew not the cauſe of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but ſeeing my cheerfulneſſe under it, beſeeched the Lord to bleſſe
me and ſtrengthen me.</p>
            <p>At the laſt we came to the Pillorie, where I was unlooſed from the
Cart, and having put on ſome of my clothes, wee went to the <hi>Taverne,</hi>
where I ſtaid a prettie while waiting for my Surgeon, which was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96031:13"/>
not yet come to dreſſe mee, where were many of my friends, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
rejoyced to ſee my courage, that the Lord had enabled me to
undergoe my puniſhment ſo willingly, who asked mee how I did.
I told them, as well as ever I was in my life, I bleſſe my God for it;
for I felt ſuch inward joy and comfort, cheering up my ſoule, that I
lightly eſteemed my ſufferings.</p>
            <p>And this I counted my wedding day, in which I was married to the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for now I know hee loves me, in that hee hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſo rich apparell this day upon mee, and counted mee worthy to
ſuffer for his ſake.</p>
            <p>I having a deſire to retire into a private roome from the multitude of
people that were about mee, which made mee like to faine; I had not
beene there long, but Mr. <hi>Lightborne,</hi> the Tipſtaffe of the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi>
came unto me, ſaying, the Lords ſent him to me to know if I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my ſelfe to be in a fault, and then hee knew what to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me. To whom I replyed, Have their Honours cauſed mee to be
whipt from the <hi>Fleet</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and do they now ſend to know if I
will acknowledge a fault? they ſhould have done this before I had
beene whipt; for now, ſeeing I have undergone the greateſt part of my
puniſhment, I hope the Lord will aſſiſt me to goe through it all: and
beſides, if I would have done this at the firſt I needed not to have come
to this; But as I told the Lords when I was before them at the Barre,
ſo I deſire you to tell them againe, that I am not conſcious to my ſelfe
of doing any thing that deſerves a ſubmiſſion, but yet I doe willingly
ſubmit to their Lordſhips pleaſures in my cenſure. Hee told mee, if I
would confeſſe a fault, it would ſave mee a ſtanding in the Pillorie,
otherwiſe. I muſt undergoe the burthen of it.</p>
            <p>Well (ſaid I) I regard not a little outward diſgrace for the cauſe of
my God, I have found alreadie that ſweetneſſe in him in whom I have
believed, that through his ſtrength, I am able to undergoe any thing
that ſhall be inflicted on me; But me thinks that I had very hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that I ſhould be condemned and thus puniſhed upon two Oathes,
in which the partie hath moſt falſly forſworne himſelfe; and becauſe
I would not take an Oath to betray mine owne innocencie. Why <hi>Paul</hi>
found more mercy from the Heathen <hi>Romane Governours</hi> for they would
not put him to an Oath to accuſe himſelfe, but ſuffered him to make
the beſt defence he could for himſelfe, neither would they condemne
him, before his accuſers and hee were brought face to face to juſtifie,
and fully to prove their accuſation; but the Lords have not dealt ſo
with me, for my accuſers and I were never brought face to face to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their accuſation againſt me: it is true two falſe Oaths were ſworne
againſt me, and I was thereupon condemned; and becauſe I would
not accuſe my ſelfe. It is true (ſaid hee) it was ſo with <hi>Paul,</hi> but the
Lawes of this Land is otherwiſe than their Lawes were in thoſe dayes.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96031:14"/>
Then ſaid I, they are worſe and more cruell, than the Lawes of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
and Heathen <hi>Romanes</hi> were, who would condemne no man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
witneſſes, and they ſhould be brought face to face, to juſtifie their
accuſation, and ſo he went away, and I prepared my ſelfe for the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory,
to which I went with a joyfull courage; and when I was upon
it I made obeyſance to the <hi>Lords,</hi> ſome of them (as I ſuppoſe) looking out
at the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> window towards me, And ſo I put my necke into
the hole, which being a great deale too low for mee, it was very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to me, in regard of continuance of the time that I ſtood on the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorie,
which was about two houres, my backe alſo being very ſore, and
the Sunne ſhining ſo exceeding hot, and the <hi>Tipſtaffe-man</hi> not ſuffering
mee to keepe on my hat to defend my head from the heate of the Sunne,
ſo that I ſtood there in great paine; yet through the ſtrength of my
God I underwent it with courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the very laſt minute; and lifting
up my heart and ſpirit unto my God.</p>
            <p>While I was thus ſtanding on the pillorie; I craved his powerfull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
with the Spirit of wiſedome and courage, that I might open
my mouth with boldneſſe, and ſpeake thoſe things that might make for
his greateſt glory, and the goood of his people; and ſo caſting mine
eyes on the multitude, I began to ſpeake after this manner:</p>
            <p>My <hi>Chriſtian Brethren,</hi> to all you that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and
deſire that he ſhould raigne and rule in your hearts and lives, to you
eſpecially, and to as many as heare me this day, I direct my ſpeech.</p>
            <p>I ſtand here in the place of ignominy and ſhame; yet to me it is not
ſo, but I owne and embrace it, as the <hi>Welcome Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and as a
badge of my <hi>Chriſtian Profeſsion:</hi> I have beene already whipt from the
<hi>Fleete</hi> to this place, by vertue of a cenſure, from the <hi>Honourable Lords</hi> of
the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> hereunto, the Cauſe of my cenſure I ſhall declare
unto you as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>The Lord by his ſpeciall hand of providence, ſo ordered it, that not
long agoe I was in <hi>Holland,</hi> where I was like to have ſettled my ſelfe in
a courſe of trading that might have brought me in a pretty large porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of earthly things, (after which my heart did too much runne) but the
Lord having a better portion in ſtore for me, and more durable riches
to beſtow upon my ſoule, by the ſame hand of providence, brought me
backe againe, and caſt mee into eaſie affliction, that thereby I might
be weaned from the world, and ſee the vanity and emptineſſe of all
things therein. And hee hath now pitched my ſoule upon ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of beautie, amiableneſſe and excellencie, as is as permanent and
endurable, as Eternity it ſelfe, namely, the perſonall excellencie of the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the ſweetneſſe of whoſe preſence, no affliction can
ever be able to wreſt out of my ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now, while I was in <hi>Holland,</hi> it ſeemes there were divers Bookes,
of that noble and renowned Doctor <hi>Iohn Baſtwicke</hi> ſent into <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96031:14"/>
which came to the hands of one <hi>Edmond Chillington,</hi> for the ſending
over of which I was taken and apprehended, the plot being before laid,
by one <hi>Iohn Chilliburne</hi> (whom I ſuppoſed, and tooke to be my friend)
ſervant to my old fellow ſoldier, Maſter <hi>Iohn Wharton,</hi> living in <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi>
after this manner.</p>
            <p>I walking in the ſtreet with the ſaid <hi>Iohn Chilliburne,</hi> was taken by the
<hi>Purſevant</hi> and his men; the ſaid <hi>Iohn,</hi> as I verily believe, having given
direction to them where to ſtand, and hee himſelfe was the third man
that laid hands on mee to hold mee.</p>
            <p>Now at my cenſure before the <hi>Lords,</hi> I there declared upon the
word of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that I ſent not over thoſe Bookes neither did I know
the Ship that brought them, nor my of the men that belonged to the
Ship, nor to my knowledge did I ever ſee, either Ship, or any apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to it in all my dayes.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, I was accuſed at my examination before the <hi>Kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney</hi>
at his Chamber, by the ſaid <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

living in Canon-ſtreet,</hi> neere <hi>Alchurch Lane,</hi> and late priſoner in <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
and <hi>Newgate,</hi> for printing ten or welve thouſand Bookes in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that I woud have printed the <hi>Vnmasking the myſterie of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie;</hi>
if I could have gotten a true copy of it, and that I had a Chamber
in Maſtor <hi>Iohn Foots</hi> houſe at <hi>Delfe,</hi> where he thinks the Books were kept.</p>
            <p>Now, here I declare before you all, upon the word of a ſuffering
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that hee might as well have accuſed me of printing a hundred
thouſand hookes, and the one been as true as the other; and for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               </hi> upon the word of an honeſt

farre from having a Chamber there, as I never lay in his houſe but
twice or thrice at the moſt: and upon the laſt Friday of the laſt Terme,
I was brought to the <hi>Star-Chamber Barre,</hi> where before me was read the
ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">It hath beene an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing in the Star-chamber and high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forge Affidavits, or to make addition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</note> 
               <hi>Edmond Chillingtons Affidavit,</hi> upon Oath, againſt M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and my ſelfe; the ſumme of which oath, was, That hee and I had
printed (at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>) Doctor <hi>Baſtwicks Anſwer,</hi> and his <hi>Letany,</hi>
withdivers other ſcandalous Bookes.</p>
            <p>Now, here againe, I ſpeake it in the preſence of God, and all you that
heare mee, that Maſter <hi>Wharton</hi> and I never joyned together in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
either theſe, or any other Bookes whatſoever, neither did I receive
any money from him toward the printing any.</p>
            <p>Withall, in his firſt Oath, hee peremptorily ſwore; that wee had
printed them at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> unto which I likewiſe ſay, That he hath
in this particular forſworne himſelfe; for mine owne part, I never
in all my dayes either printed, or cauſed to be printed, either for
my ſelfe, or for Maſter <hi>Wharton</hi> any Bookes at <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> neither
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96031:15"/>
did I come into any Printing-houſe there, all the time I was in the
Citie.</p>
            <p>And then upon the Tueſday after, he ſwore againſt both of us againe.
The ſumme of which Oathes was, that I had confeſſed to him (which
is moſt falſe) that I had printed Doctor <hi>Baſtwicke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Anſwer to Sir <hi>Iohn
Bancks</hi> his <hi>Information,</hi> and his <hi>Letany;</hi> and another Booke, called, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Anſwers to Certaine Objections:</hi> and another Booke, called, <hi>The
Vanity and Impiety of the old Letany;</hi> and that I had divers other Bookes
of the ſaid Doctor <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> in printing, and that Maſter <hi>Wharton</hi> had
been at the charges of printing a Book called <hi>A Breviate</hi> of the Biſhops
late proceedings; and another Booke called ſixteene <hi>new Queries,</hi> and
in this his Oath hath ſworne they were printed at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
elſe in <hi>Holland;</hi> and that one <hi>Iames Oldam,</hi> a <hi>Turner,</hi> keeping Shop
at <hi>Weſtminſter-hall-gate,</hi> diſperſed divers of theſe Bookes. Now, in this
Oath he hath againe forſworne himſelfe in a high degree; for whereas
he tooke his Oath that I had printed the Booke called <hi>The Vanity and
Impiety of the old Letany;</hi> I here ſpeake it before you all, that I never in
all my dayes did ſee one of them in print, but I muſt confeſſe, I have
ſeene and read it in written hand, before the Doctor was cenſured,
and as for other Bookes, of which he ſaith, I have divers in printing.
To that I anſwer, that for mine owne particular. I never read nor ſaw
any of the Doctors Bookes; but the forenamed foure in Engliſh, and
one little thing more of about two ſheets of paper, which is annexed to
the <hi>Vanity of the old Letany</hi> and as for his Latine Bookes, I never ſaw
any but two. Namely, his <hi>Flagellum,</hi> for which he was firſt cenſured in
the <hi>High Commiſsion Court,</hi> and his <hi>Apologeticus,</hi> which were both in print
long before I knew the Doctor. But it is true, there is a ſecond edition
of his <hi>Flagellum,</hi> but that was at the preſſe above two yeeres agoe: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1634. and ſome of this impreſſion was in <hi>England</hi> before I
came out of <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are the maine things for which I was cenſured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
being two oathes in which the ſaid <hi>Chillington</hi> hath palpably
forſworne himſelfe; and if hee had not forſworne himſelfe, yet by the
Law (as I am given to underſtand) I might have excepted againſt
him, being a guiltie perſon himſelfe, and a priſoner, and did that
which he did againſt mee for purchaſing his owne libertie, which hee
hath by ſuch Judaſly meanes got and obtained; who is alſo knowne
to be a lying fellow, as I told the Lords I was able to prove and
make good.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, there was an inquiſition-oath tendered unto mee
(which I refuſed to take) on foure ſeverall dayes; the ſumme of
which Oath is thus much: You ſhall ſweare that you ſhall make
true anſwer to all things that ſhall be asked of you: So helpe you
God. Now this Oath I refuſed as a ſinfull and unlawfull Oath: it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96031:15"/>
being the <hi>High-Commiſsion Oath,</hi> with which the Prelates ever have,
and ſtill doe, ſo butcherly torment, afflict and undoe, the deare Saints
and Servants of God. It is an oath againſt the Law of the Land (as
Maſter <hi>Nicholas Fuller</hi> in his Argument doth prove: And alſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
againſt the <hi>Petition of Right an Act of Parliament Enacted</hi> in the
ſecond yeere of our King. Againe, it is abſolutely againſt the Law
of God; for that Law requires no man to accuſe himſelfe, but if any
thing be laid to his charge, there muſt come two or three witneſſes at
the leaſt to prove it: It is alſo againſt the practice of Chriſt himſelfe,
who in all his examinations before the High Prieſt, would not accuſe
himſelfe, but upon their demands, returned this anſwer: <hi>Why aske you
me? goe to them that heard me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Withall, this Oath is againſt the very law of Nature; for nature is
alwaies a preſerver of it ſelfe, and not a deſtroyer: But if a man takes
this wicked oath, he deſtroyes and undoes himſelfe, as daily experience
doth witneſſe. Nay, it is worſe than the Law of the Heathen <hi>Romanes,</hi>
as wee may reade, <hi>Acts 25. 16. For, when Paul ſtood before the Pagan Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and the Iewes required judgement againſt him, the Governour replyed,
it is not the manner of the Romans to condemne any man, before he and his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
be brought face to face to juſtifie their accuſation.</hi> But for mine owne part,
if I had beene proceeded againſt by a Bill, I would have anſwered and
juſtified all that they could have proved againſt me, and by the ſtrength
of my God, would have ſealed whatſoever I have done with my blood,
for I am privie to mine owne actions, and my conſcience beares mee
witneſſe, that I have laboured ever ſince the Lord in mercy made the
riches of his grace knowne to my ſoule, to keepe a good conſcience,
and to walke inoffenſively both towards God and man. But as for that
oath that was put upon mee, I did refuſe to take it, as a ſinfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
oath, and by the ſtrength of my God inabling me, I will never
take it, though I be puld in pieces with wilde horſes, as the ancient
Chriſtians were by the bloody Tyrants, in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> neither
ſhall I thinke that man a faithfull Subject of Chriſts Kingdome, that
ſhall at any time hereafter take it, ſeeing the wickedneſſe of it hath been
ſo apparently laid open by ſo many, for the refuſall whereof many doe
ſuffer cruell perſecution to this day.</p>
            <p>Thus have I as briefly as I could, declared unto you, the whole cauſe
of my ſtanding here this day, I being upon theſe grounds cenſured by
the Lords at the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> on the laſt Court day of the laſt Terme, to
pay 500. pounds to the King, and to receive the puniſhment which with
rejoycing I have undergone, unto whoſe cenſure I doe with willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and cheerefulneſſe ſubmit my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing I now ſtand here at this preſent, I intend, the Lord aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
me with his power, and guiding me by his Spirit, to declare my
minde unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96031:16"/>
I have nothing to ſay to any mans perſon, and therefore will not
meddle with that, onely the things that I have to ſay in the firſt place,
are concerning the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and their calling: They challenge their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> and for the oppugning of which, thoſe there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
living martyrs of the Lord, Doctor <hi>Baſtwicke,</hi> Maſter <hi>Burton</hi>
and Maſter <hi>Prin,</hi> did ſuffer in this place, and they have ſufficiently
proved, that their calling is not from God, which men I love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and doe perſwade my ſelfe that their ſoules are deare and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the ſight of God, though they were ſo cruelly and butcherly
dealt with by the Prelates; and as for Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Prin,</hi>
they are worthy and learned men, but yet did not in many things
write ſo fully as the Doctor did, who hath ſufficiently and plentifully
ſet forth the wickedneſſe, both of the Prelates themſelves and of their
callings (as you may reade in his Bookes) that they are not <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi>
which noble and reverend Doctor I love with my ſoule; and
as he is a man that ſtands for the truth and glory of God, my very life
and heart-blood I will lay downe for his honour, and the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his cauſe for which hee ſuffered, it being Gods cauſe. As for
the Biſhops, they uſed in former times to challenge their juriſdiction,
callings and power from the King; but they have now openly in the
<hi>High Commiſsion Court</hi> renounced that, as was heard by many, at the
cenſure of that Noble Doctor. And as you may fully reade in his
<hi>Apologettcus;</hi> and in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Sir <hi>John Bancks</hi> his <hi>Information.</hi> Now
I will here maintain it before them all, that their callings is ſo far from
being, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> (as they ſay they are) that they are rather <hi>jure Diabolico,</hi>
which if I be not able to prove, let mee be hanged up at the Hall gate.
But my brethren, for your better ſatisfaction, reade the 9. and 13.
<hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and there you ſhall ſee, that there came <hi>Locuſts</hi>
out of the <hi>Bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> part of whom they are, and they are there
lively deſcribed. Alſo you ſhall there finde, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (which is
the Pope, or <hi>Romane</hi> State and government) hath given to him by the
<hi>Dragon</hi> (the <hi>Divell</hi>) his power and ſeate, and great authoritie, So that
the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie comes from the divell, and the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and their
Creatures in their printed Bookes, doe challenge their authoritie,
juriſdiction and power, (that they exerciſe over all ſorts of people)
is from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for proving of the Church of England, to be a true Church,
their beſt and ſtrongeſt argument is, that the Biſhops are lineally deſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from his Holineſſe (or Impiouſneſſe) of <hi>Rome,</hi> as you may reade in
<hi>Pocklingtons</hi> Booke, called <hi>Sunday no Sabbath.</hi> So that by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
they ſtand by that ſame power and authority that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the <hi>Pope.</hi> So that their calling is not from God, but from
the Divell. For the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot give a better authoritie or calling to
them then he himſelfe hath; but his authority and calling is from the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96031:16"/>
Divell, therefore the Prelates calling and authority is from the Divell
alſo, <hi>Revel. 9. 3. And there came out of the ſmoake, Locuſts upon the earth,
and unto them was given power, as the Scorpions of the earth have power to
hurt and undoe men,</hi> as the Prelates daily doe: and alſo, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 2.
<hi>And the Beaſt which I ſaw</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>was like unto a Leopard,
and his feete were as the feete of a Beare, and his mouth as the mouth of
a Lion, and the Dragon</hi> (that is to ſay, the Divell) <hi>gave him his power, his
ſeat and great authoritie;</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 15. 16, 17. And whether the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
as well as the Pope, doe not daily the ſame things, let every man
that hath but comon reaſon judge.</p>
            <p>For, doe not their daily practiſes and cruell burthens impoſed on
all ſorts of people, high and low, rich and poore, witneſſe that
their diſcent is from the Beaſt, part of his ſtate and kingdome: So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 13, 14. all which places doe declare, that their power
and authoritie being from the Pope, (as they themſelves confeſſe)
therefore it muſt needs originally come from the Divell; for their
power and callings muſt of neceſſitie proceed either from God, or
elſe from the Divell; but it proceeds not from God, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſufficiently declare, therefore their calling and power proceeds
from the Divell, as both Scripture and their owne daily practiſes doe
demonſtrate and prove, and as for that laſt place cited, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. 14.
If you pleaſe to reade the ſecond and third parts of Doctor <hi>Baſtwicks
Letany,</hi> you ſhall finde, hee there proves, that the Prelates practices
doe every way ſuit with, and make good that portion of Scripture
to the utmoſt. For in their Sermons that they preach before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
how doe they incenſe the King and Nobles againſt the people
of God, labouring to make them odious in his ſight, and ſtirring
him up to execute vengeance upon them, though they be the moſt
harmeleſſe generation of all others.</p>
            <p>And as for all theſe officers that are under them, and made by them,
for mine owne particular, I cannot ſee, but that their callings are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
as the Biſhops themſelves; and in particular, for the callings
of the Miniſters, I doe not, nor will not ſpeake againſt their perſons,
for I know ſome of them to be very able men, and men of excellent
gifts and qualifications, and I perſwade my ſelfe, their ſoules are very
deare and pretious in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, this proves not their callings to be ever the
better, as it is in civill government: If the King (whom God hath
made a lawfull Magiſtrate) make a wicked man an officer, hee is as
true an officer, and as well to be obeyed, comming in the Kings name,
as the beſt man in the world comming with the ſame authority; for in
ſuch a caſe, hee that is a wicked man, hath his calling from as good
authoritie as the godlieſt man hath; and therefore his calling is as
good as the others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96031:17"/>
But on the other ſide, if hee that hath no authority make officers,
though the men themſelves be never ſo good and holy, yet their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
makes their calling never a whit the truer, but ſtill is a falſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
in regard his authority was not good not lawfull that made them:
and even ſo the Miniſters be they never ſo holy men, yet they have one
and the ſame calling with the wickedeſt that is amongſt them, their
holineſſe proves not their callings to be ever the truer, ſeeing their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that made them Miniſters is falſe, and therefore they have more
to anſwer for than any of the reſt, by how much the more God hath
beſtowed greater guifts upon them than upon others, and yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the truth in unrighteouſneſſe from Gods people, and doe not
make knowne to them as they ought, the whole Will and Counſell,
of God.</p>
            <p>And againe, the greater is their ſinne, if their callings be unlawfull
(as I verily believe they are) in that they ſtil hold them and do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lay down and renounce them, or they do but deceive the people,
and highly diſhonour God, and ſin againſt their own ſoules, while they
preach unto the people by vertue of an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and unlawfull
calling; and the more godly and able the Miniſter is that ſtill preaches
by vertue of this calling, the more hurt he doth; for the people that have
ſuch a Miniſter will not be perſwaded of the truth of things, though
one ſpeake and informe them in the name of the Lord, but will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to reply, Our Miniſter that preaches ſtill by vertue of this Calling,
is ſo holy a man, that were not his calling right and good, I doe aſſure
my ſelfe he would no longer preach by vertue thereof. And thus the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of the Miniſter is a cloake to cover the unlawfulneſſe of his
calling, and make the people continue rebels againſt Chriſt his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Kingdome, which is an aggravation of his ſinne: for by this
meanes the people are kept off from receiving the whole truth into their
ſoules, and reſt in being but almoſt Chriſtians, or but Chriſtians in
part. But, Oh my brethren, it behoves all you that feare God, and
tender the ſalvation of your owne ſoules, to looke about you, and to
ſhake off that long ſecurity and formality in Religion, that you have
laine in: For God of all things cannot endure <hi>Lukewarmneſſe, Rev.</hi> 3. 16.
and ſearch out diligently the truth of things, and try them in the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of the Sanctuary.</hi> I beſeech you take things no more upon truſt, as
hitherto you have done, but take paines to ſearch and find out thoſe
ſpirituall and hidden truths that God hath enwrapped in his ſacred
Booke, and find out a bottome for your owne ſoules: for if you will
have the comforts of them, you muſt beſtow ſome labour for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them, and you muſt ſearch diligently before you finde them,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 2. Labour alſo to withdraw your necks from under that ſpirituall
and Antichriſtian bondage (unto which you have for a long time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
your ſoules) leſt the Lord cauſe his plagues, and the fierceneſſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96031:17"/>
of his wrath to ſeize both upon your bodies and ſoules; ſeeing you
are now warned of the danger of theſe things.</p>
            <p>For he himſelfe hath ſaid, <hi>Rev. 14. 9. 10, 11. That if any man worſhip
the Beaſt and his Image and receive his marke in his forehead, or in his hand;
the ſame ſhall drinke of the wine of his wrath, which is powred out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
into the cup of his indignation, and he ſhall he tormented with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lambe, and
the ſmooke of their torment aſcended up for ever and ever, and they have no reſt,
day nor night, who worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and whoſoever receiveth the
marke of his name.</hi> Therefore, as you love your owne ſoules, and looke
for that immortall Crowne of happineſſe in the world to come, looke
that you withdraw your ſelves from that Antichriſtian power and
ſlavery that you are now under, even as God himſelfe hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and injoyned you in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. ſaying, <hi>Come out of her my people, that
you be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that you receive not of her plagues, for her
ſinnes have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities.</hi> Here
is the voyce of God himſelfe commanding all his choſen ones, though
they have lived under this Antichriſtian ſlaviſh power and eſtate along
time, yet at laſt, to withdraw their obedience and ſubjection from it.
My brethren, we are all at this preſent, in a very dangerous and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
condition, under the Idolatrous and ſpirituall bondage of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
in regard wee have turned traytors unto our God, in ſeeing his
Almighty great name, and his heavenly truth troden under foot, and ſo
highly diſhonoured by them, and yet wee not onely let them alone in
holding our peace, but moſt ſlaviſhly and wickedly ſubject our ſelves
unto them, fearing the face of a piece of dirt, more than the Almighty
great, God of Heaven and Earth, who is able to caſt both body and
ſoule into everlaſting damnation.</p>
            <p>Oh repent, I beſeech you therefore repent, for that great diſhonour
you have ſuffered to be done unto God by your fearefulneſſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe,
and for the time to come, put on couragious reſolutions
like valiant ſouldiers of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and fight manfully in this his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
battell, in which battell ſome of his ſouldiers have already loſt
part of their blood, and withall, ſtudy this Booke of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and
there you ſhall find the myſterie of iniquitie fully unfolded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained;
and alſo you ſhall ſee what great ſpirituall battels have beene
fought betwixt the Lambe and his Servant, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> (the <hi>Divell</hi>)
and his vaſſals, and ſome are to fight.</p>
            <p>Therefore, gird on your ſpirituall armour, ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. that
you may quit your ſelves like good and faithful ſouldiers, and feare no
colours, the victory and conqueſt is ours already; for wee are ſure to
have it (I doe not ſpeake of any bodily and temporall battell, but onely
of a ſpirituall one) and be not diſcouraged and knocked off from the
ſtudy of it, becauſe of the obſcurity and darkneſſe of it, fore Lord
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96031:18"/>
hath promiſed his enlightening Spirit unto all his people that are labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and ſtudious to know him aright, and alſo hee hath promiſed a
bleſſing, and pronounced a bleſſedneſſe unto all that reade and labour
to keep the things contained in this booke, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 3. My Chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, I beſeech you doe not contemne the
things that are delivered to you, in regard of the meanneſſe and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of me the inſtrument, being but one of the meaneſt and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt
of the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Lord many times doth great
things by weake meanes, that his power may be more ſeene; for we
are too ready to caſt our eye upon the meanes and inſtrument, not
looking up unto that Almighty power that is in God, who is able to
doe the greateſt things by the weakeſt meanes, and therefore out of the
mouths of <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings</hi> he hath ordained ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 2. And
he hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and
God hath choſen the weake things of the world to confound the things
which are mighty, and baſe things of the world, and things which are
deſpiſed hath God choſen, yea, things which are not, to bring to nought
things that are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. 28. And he gives the reaſon wherefore he is
pleaſed ſo to doe. <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So you ſee God is not tyed to any inſtrument and meanes to effect
his owne glory, but hee by the leaſt inſtrument is able to bring to paſſe
the greateſt things.</p>
            <p>It is true, I am a young man, and no Scholler, according to that
which the world counts Schollerſhip, yet I have obtained mercy of
the Lord to be faithfull, and bee by a divine providence, hath brought
mee hither this day; and I ſpeake to you in the name of the Lord being
aſſiſted with the ſpirit and power of the God of heaven and earth, and I
ſpeake not the words of raſhneſſe or inconſiderateneſſe, but the words of
ſoberneſſe, and mature deliberation; for I did conſult with my God,
before I came hither, and deſired him that hee would direct and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
me to ſpeake that which might be for his glory, and the good of his
people. And as I am a ſouldier, fighting under the banner of the great
and mighty Captain, <hi>the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and as I looke for that crowne
of immortality, which one day I know ſhall be ſet upon my temples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the condition that I am in, I dare not hold my peace, but ſpeake
unto you with boldneſſe in the might and ſtrength of my God, the
things which the Lord in mercy hath made knowne unto my ſoule,
come life come death.</p>
            <p>When I was here about, there came a fat <hi>Lawyer,</hi> I doe not know
his name and commanded me to hold my peace, and leave my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
To whom I replyed and ſaid, Sir, I will not hold my peace, but
ſpeake my mind freely, though I be hanged at <hi>Tiburne</hi> for my paines. It
ſeems he himſelfe was galled and touched as the <hi>Lawyers</hi> were in Chriſts
time, when he ſpake againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which made them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96031:18"/>
ſay, <hi>Maſter, in ſaying thus, thou revileſt us alſo.</hi> So he went his way, and (I
think) complained to the <hi>Lords,</hi> but I went on with my ſpeech and ſaid:</p>
            <p>My brethren, be not diſcouraged at the wayes of God for the
affliction and croſſe that doth accompany them, for it is ſweet and
comfortable drawing in the yoake of Chriſt for all that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I have
found it ſo by experience; for my ſoule is fild ſo full of ſpirituall and
heavenly joy, that with my tongue I am not able to expreſſe it, neither
are any capable (I think) to partake of ſo great a degree of conſolation,
but onely thoſe upon whom the Lords gracious afflicting hand is.
And for mine owne part, I ſtand this day in the place of an evill
doer, but my conſcience witneſſeth that I am not ſo. And herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
I put my hand into my pocket, and puld out three of worthy
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> Books, and threw them among the people, and ſaid, There
is part of the Bookes for which I ſuffer, take them among you, and reade
them, and ſee if you find any thing in them againſt the Law of God, the
Law of the Land, the glory of God, the honour of the King or State.</p>
            <p>I am the ſonne of a Gentle man, and my friends are of ranke
and qualitie in the Countrey where they live, which is 200. miles
from this place, and I am in my preſent condition deſerted of them
all, for I know, not one of them dare meddle with mee in my preſent
eſtate, being I am ſtung by the <hi>Scorpions</hi> (the <hi>Prelates</hi>) and for any
thing that I know, it may be, I ſhall never have a favourable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
from any of them againe, and withall, I am a young man, and
likely to have lived well, and in plenty, according to the faſhion of the
world; yet notwithſtanding, for the cauſe of Chriſt, and to doe him
ſervice, I have, and doe bid adue to father, friends, riches, pleaſures,
eaſe, contented life and blood, and lay all downe at the foot-ſtoole
of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> being willing to part with all, rather then I will diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, or in the leaſt meaſure part with the peace of a good
conſcience, and that ſweetneſſe and joy which I have found in him,
for in naked Chriſt is the quinteſſence of ſweetneſſe, and I am ſo farre
from thinking my affliction and puniſhment which this day I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
and ſtill doe endure and grone under (a diſgrace) that I receive
it as the welcome <hi>Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and doe thinke my ſelfe this day more
honoured by my ſufferings, then if a crowne of gold had beene ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my head; for I have in ſome part beene made conformable to
my Lord and Maſter, and have in ſome meaſure drunke of the ſame
Cup which hee himſelfe dranke of, while he was in this ſinfull world;
for hee ſhed his moſt pretious blood for the ſalvation of my poore
ſoule, that ſo I might be reconciled to his father, therefore am I willing
to undergoe any thing for his ſake, and that inward joy and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
within me that carries me high above all my pains and torments and
you (<hi>my brethren</hi>) if you be willing to have Chriſt, you muſt owne him,
and take him upon his own termes, and know that Chriſt and the croſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96031:19"/>
is inſeparable; for he that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer
perſecution and affliction, it is the lot and portion of all his choſen ones,
through many afflictions and trialls we muſt enter into glory; and the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>that if wee be without afflictions, whereof all are partakers, then are
yee Baſtards, and not Sonnes.</hi> And therefore, if you will have Chriſt, ſit
downe and reckon before ever you make profeſſion of him, what hee
will coſt you, leſt when you come to the triall, you diſhonour him,
and if you be not willing and contented with all, and let all goe for his
ſake, you are not worthy of him.</p>
            <p>If Parents, Husband, Wife or children, lands or livings, riches or
honours, pleaſure or caſe, life or blood, ſtand in the way, you muſt be
willing to part with all theſe, and to entertaine Chriſt naked and alone,
though you have nothing but the Croſſe, or elſe you are not worthy of
him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37. 38.</p>
            <p>Oh, my brethren, there is ſuch ſweetneſſe and contentedneſſe in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> alone, that it is able, where it is felt, to make a man
goe through all difficulties, and endure all hardſhips that may poſſibly
come upon him. Therefore, if he call you to it, doe not deny him, nor
his truth in the leaſt manner; for he hath ſaid, <hi>Hee that denyes him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, him will he deny before his Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And now
is the time that wee muſt ſhew our ſelves good ſouldiers of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>
for his truth, his cauſe and glory lies at ſtake in a high degree, therefore
put on couragious reſolutions, and withdraw your necks and ſoules
from all falſe power and worſhip, and fight with courage and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in this ſpirituall battell, in which battell, the Lord before your
eyes hath raiſed up ſome valiant Champions that fought up to the eares
in blood, therefore be couragious ſouldiers and fight it out bravely, that
your God may be glorified by you, and let him onely have the ſervice,
both of your inward and outward man, and ſtand to his cauſe, and love
your owne ſoules, and feare not the face of any mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll man; for God
hath promiſed to be with you, and uphold you, that they ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt you, <hi>Eſay</hi> 41. 10, 11. But alas, how few are there that date
ſhew any courage for God and his cauſe, though his glory lies at the
ſtake, but thinke themſelves happy and well, and count themſelves
wiſe men, if they can ſleepe in a whole skin, when Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Hee
that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and he that will loſe his life for his ſake, ſhall
find it. What ſhall it profit a man, if he gaine the whole world, and loſe his
owne ſoule?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is better for a man to be willing and contented to let
all goe for the enjoying of Chriſt, and doing him ſervice, then to ſit
downe and ſleepe in a whole skinne, though in ſo doing hee gaine all
the world, and ſee him diſhonoured, his glory and truth troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot, and the blood of his ſervants ſhed and ſpilt?</p>
            <p>Yes without doubt it is: but many are in theſe times, ſo farre from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96031:19"/>
ſuffering valiantly for Chriſt, that they rather diſſwade men from it,
and count it a point of ſingularity and pride, and ſelfe-ends for a man,
to put himſelfe forward to doe God ſervice; asking, what calling and
warrant any private man hath there unto ſeeing it belongs to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to ſpeake of theſe things. Yes, ſo it doth, but alas, they are ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and fearfull that they dare not ſpeake.</p>
            <p>And therefore it belongs alſo to thee, or me, or any other man, if thou
beeſt a ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt, whatſoever by place or calling thy
rank or degree be, be it higher or lower, yet if he call for thy ſervice, thou
art bound, though others ſtand ſtill, to maintaine his power and glory
to the utmoſt of thy power &amp; ſtrength, yea, to the ſhedding the laſt drop
of thy blood, for hee hath not loved his life unto the death for thy ſake,
but ſhed his precious blood for the redemption of thy ſoule: hath hee
done this for thee; and dareſt thou ſee him diſhonoured, and his glory
lie at the ſtake, and not ſpeake on his behalfe, or doe him the beſt ſervice
thou canſt?</p>
            <p>If one of a baſe &amp; cowardly ſpirit thus thou doſt, let me tell thee here,
and that truly to thy face, thou haſt a <hi>Dalila</hi> in thine heart, which thou
loveſt more than God, and that thou ſhalt one day certainly finde by
wofull experience. Alas, if men ſhould hold their peace in ſuch times
as theſe, the Lord would cauſe the very ſtones to ſpeake to convince
man of his cowardly baſeneſſe.</p>
            <p>Having proceeded in a manner thus far by the ſtrength of my God,
with boldneſſe and courage in my ſpeech, <hi>The Warden of the Fleet</hi> came
with the ſat <hi>Lawyer</hi> and commanded me to hold my peace. To whom
I replyed, I would ſpeake and declare my cauſe and minde, though I
were to be hanged at the gate for my ſpeaking. And hee cauſed procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to be made upon the pillory, for bringing to him the bookes:
ſo then he commanded mee to be gagged, and if I ſpake any more, that
then I ſhould be whipt againe upon the Pillory.</p>
            <p>So I remained about an houre and a halfe gagged, being intercepted
of much matter, which by Gods aſſiſtance I intended to have ſpoken;
but yet with their cruelty I was nothing at all daunted, for I was full
of comfort and courage, being mightily ſtrengthned with the power
of the Almighty, which made me with cheerefullneſſe triumph over all
my ſufferings, not ſhewing one ſad countenance or diſcontented heart.</p>
            <p>And when I was to come downe, having taken out my head out of
the Pillory, I looked about mee upon the people, and ſaid, <hi>I am more
then a conqueror through him that hath loved mee, Vivat Rex,</hi> Let the King
live for ever, and ſo I came downe and was had backe againe to the
Taverne, where I, together with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Wharton,</hi> ſtaid a while, till one
went to the <hi>Warden</hi> to know what ſhould be done with mee, who gave
order we ſhould be carryed backe againe to the <hi>Fleete,</hi> and as I went by
land through the ſtreets, great ſtore of people ſtood all along, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96031:20"/>
me, and many of them bleſſed God for enabling me to undergoe
my ſufferings with ſuch cheerefulneſſe and courage as I did, for I was
mightily filled with the ſweet preſence of Gods Spirit, which cauſed
me notwithſtanding the paines of my ſufferings to goe alone the ſtreets
with a joyfull countenance not ſhewing the leaſt diſcontentedneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
if I had been going to take poſſeſſion of ſo ne great treaſures.</p>
            <p>After I came back to the priſon, none were ſuffered to come at me but
the Surgeon to dreſſe mee, and I feeling my ſelfe ſomewhat feveriſh, I
went to bed and my Surgeon doubting the ſame alſo gave me a Gliſter,
and appointed to come the next morning and let me blood, but when
he came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could not be permitted to come at me, nor any elſe, for the
<hi>Porter</hi> kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the key and lock'd me up very cloſe, ſaying, the <hi>Warden</hi> gave
him ſtraight command ſo to doe. Whereupon I deſired the Surgeon to
goe to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to the <hi>Warden</hi> and certifie him how it was with me,
(being very ill) and that he might have liberty to come at me to let me
blood and dreſſe me which could not be obtained, till the <hi>Warden</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
came home. About one of the clock <hi>Iohn Hawes</hi> the <hi>Porter</hi> came to
me, to know what I had to ſay to the <hi>Warden,</hi> to whom I ſaid, Maſter
<hi>Hawes</hi> this is very cruell and harſh dealing, that after ſo ſore whipping,
my Surgeon ſhall not be admitted to come and dreſſe me, nor any other
be ſuffered to adminiſter to my neceſſities, having not eaten all this day,
nor the laſt evening but a little <hi>Caudlè,</hi> I hope the Lords will be more
mercifull, than after the undergoing the extremity of my cenſure to take
my life from me by letting me periſh for want of looking to, therefore I
pray ſpeake to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Warden,</hi> that he would be pleaſed to give leave to my
Chirurgion to come to dreſſe and let me blood, otherwiſe I was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a Feaver, which might take away my life; So hee wiſhed me to
haye written to the <hi>Warden;</hi> I told him, if he would help me to Pen, Ink
and Paper ſo I would. No (ſaid he) I dare not doe that. Then I deſired
him to deliver my mind to the <hi>Warden</hi> by word of mouth, who then
went away, and after I was in my bed, he came to me againe, and ſaid
thus unto mee: M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Lilburne,</hi> I have one ſuite to you. What is that,
ſaid I? It is this, ſaid he, that you would help me to one of thoſe bookes
that you threw abroad at the <hi>Pillory,</hi> that I might read it, for I never read
any of them; I ſpeake not for it to doe you any hurt, only I have a great
deſire to reade one of them. Sir, I thinke you doe not (ſaid I) but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſatisfie your deſire for if I had had more of them, they ſhould yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
have all gone. I verily believe you, ſaid he, and ſo wee parted.</p>
            <p>And in a very little while after, came the <hi>Warden</hi> himſelfe with the
<hi>Porter,</hi> and I being in my bed, hee asked me how I did? Said I, I am
well, I bleſſe my God for it, and am very merry and cheerefull. Well
ſaid he, you have undone your ſelfe with ſpeaking what you did yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
Sir, ſaid I, I am not ſorry for what I have ſaid, but am heartily
glad that the Lord gave me ſtrength and courage to ſpeake what I did,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96031:20"/>
and were I to ſpeake againe, I would ſpeake twice as much as I did,
if I could have liberty, though I were immediately to loſe my life
after it. Wouldſt thou ſo, ſaid hee? Ey indeed Sir would I, with
the Lords aſſiſtance, ſaid I, for I feare not the face of Man.</p>
            <p>And concerning what I yeſterday ſpake, I did not in the leaſt
manner ſpeake againſt any of the Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but did openly declare, that
I did willingly with all contentedneſſe ſubmit my ſelfe to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and as for the Biſhops, I ſaid nothing againſt any of their
perſons, but onely againſt their Callings. Ey, ſaid the <hi>Warden,</hi> and
thou ſaidſt their Calling was from the Divell. Yes Sir, ſo I did, ſaid
I, and I will prove it, and make it good, or elſe I will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to loſe my deareſt blood; For if you pleaſe to reade the 9. and
13. <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> you ſhall there finde, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi>
which aſcended out of the bottomleſſe pit (which is the Pope and
Romane State, hath his power and authority given him by the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
(the Divell.) So that all the power which the Pope hath, and
doth exerciſe, originally comes from the Divell: If you reade al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſome Bookes lately ſet out by the Prelates themſelves, and their
Creatures, you ſhall there finde, that they claime their juriſdiction,
ſtanding and power from the Pope: Now, if their power and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
be from the Pope (as they themſelves ſay it is) then it muſt
needs be from the Divell alſo; For the Popes power and calling
is from the Divell; And he cannot give a better power and calling
to them than hee himſelfe hath; And I pray Sir, if the Biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> be offended at that which I ſpake yeſterday, tell him, I
will ſeale it with my blood; And if hee pleaſe to ſend for mee, I
will juſtifie it to his face, and if I be not able to make it good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Noble man in the Kingdome, let mee loſe my life. Ey,
but it had beene a great deale better, ſaid hee, for thine owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
good to have beene more ſparing of thy ſpeech at that time.
No Sir, ſaid I, nothing at all; for my life and blood is not deare and
precious to mee, ſo I may glorifie God, and doe him any ſervice
therewith. I aſſure thee, ſaid he, I was exceedingly chid about thee;
and alſo there were old buſineſſes rubb'd up aginſt mee concerning
Doctor <hi>Laiton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> for that liberty that they had.
Wherefore were you chid for me ſaid I? About the Bookes, ſaid hee,
that you threw abroad, in regard you were cloſe priſoner, and yet
had thoſe bookes about you; I would aske you one queſtion: Did
you bring thoſe bookes to the <hi>Fleet</hi> with you, or were they ſince
brought to you by any other? I beſeech you Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pardon me for revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that ſaid I. Then he would have knowne who they were that moſt
reſorted to me. I deſired I might be excuſed in that alſo. Ey, but you
muſt give me an anſwer, ſaid he, for I muſt certifie the Lords thereof.
Then ſaid I, I pray you tell their Honours, I am unwilling to tell you.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96031:21"/>
What were thoſe bookes, ſaid he, that you threw abroad, were they all
of one ſort? Thoſe that have them, ſaid I, can certifie you of that I my
ſelfe have one of them, ſaid he, and have read it, and can find no wit in
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is nothing but railing in it. Sir, ſaid I, I conceive you are
miſtaken, for the booke is all full of wit; it is true, this booke which
which you lighted on, is not ſo full of ſolidity as other of his bookes are;
but you muſt underſtand, that at that time when the Doctor made that
booke he was full of heavineſſe and in danger of a great puniſhment for
the Prelates had breathed out more cruelty againſt him for writing his
<hi>Apologie;</hi> and at that time alſo hee was compaſſed about on every ſide
with the Peſtilence; therefore hee made that booke to make himſelfe
merry. But, ſaid he, hee doth not write any thing in it to the purpoſe
againſt the Biſhops callings. Sir, ſaid I, I muſt confeſſe, you lighted
on the worſt of the three. And it is true, there is not much ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and force of argument in it, but onely mirth; but the other two are
as full of ſoliditie as this is of mirth. What, were they of three ſorts, ſaid
he? Yes Sir, that they were, ſaid I. What were the other two called,
ſaid he? The one ſaid I, was his <hi>Anſwer to</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Banks his information,</hi>
The other is an <hi>Anſwer to ſome Objections that are made againſt that books
which you have;</hi> but if ever you reade his <hi>Latine bookes,</hi> you ſhall there
find ſolidity enough, and the wickedneſſe and unlawfulneſſe of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
callings and practiſes ſet forth to the full. What <hi>Latine bookes</hi> be
they, ſaid he? His <hi>Flagellum,</hi> for which hee was firſt cenſured, ſaid I.
What, hath hee beene twice cenſured, ſaid hee? Yes, ſaid I, hee was
cenſured in the <hi>High Commiſsion Court,</hi> for writing his <hi>Flagellum;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he wrote his <hi>Apologie;</hi> and that little booke which you have,
which were the cauſe of his cenſure in the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> But haſt thou
any more of thoſe bookes, ſaid hee? Sir, ſaid I, if I had had twenty of
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more, they ſhould all have gone yeſterday. But haſt thou any
more of them now, ſaid hee? Sir, ſaid I, I verily thinke that if I ſhould
tell you I had not, you would not believe mee, and therefore, if you
pleaſe, you may ſearch my Chamber. So I muſt (ſaid he) for the Lords
have commanded me ſo to doe, therefore open your Trunke. Sir, ſaid I,
it is open already. Search it <hi>Iohn Hawes,</hi> ſaid he. So he ſearch'd it, and
found nothing there. Open the Cubbard, ſaid he. So I gave the Porter
the key of my Cubbard to ſearch it and he found nothing there but my
victualls. Search his pocket, ſaid the <hi>Warden.</hi> Indeed, Sir ſaid I, there is
none in them; yet he ſearched them and found as I ſaid. Then he ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
all my Chamber over, but found nothing at all. Well Sir, ſaid I,
now you can certifie the Lords how you find things with mee; but I
pray Sir, muſt I ſtill be kept cloſe priſoner? I hope now the Lords have
inflicted their cenſure on me, they will not ſtill keep mee cloſe. No,
ſaid he, within a little time you will be eaſed of it; ſo wee tooke our
leaves each of other, and he went away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:96031:21"/>
And the next day, being <hi>Friday,</hi> and a <hi>Star-Chamber-day,</hi> I hoped I
ſhould have had the liberty of the Priſon; but in ſtead thereof, newes
was brought me at evening, that I muſt be removed to the <hi>Comon-G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al,</hi>
or a worſe place, and that I muſt be put in yrons. Well for all this my
God enabled me to keepe my hold ſtill; and not to let my confidence
goe; for, (bleſſed be his name for it) this newes did not in the leaſt
manner trouble me.</p>
            <p>And upon <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, <hi>Iohn Hawes</hi> the Porter came with the
woman that looked to me, to my Chamber, to ſtand by her, that none
might ſpeake with me till ſhee had made my bed, and done other
things for me, and he told me, hee was ſorry to heare ſuch newes as he
did concerning me. What is it, ſaid I? I heare ſaid he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lords
have ordered that you muſt be put into the <hi>Wards,</hi> and kept cloſe priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
there, and lie in yrons, and none muſt be ſuffered to come at you to
bring you any thing; but you muſt live upon the Poore Mans Box Sir,
that's very hard, ſaid I, but the will of my God be done; For mine owne
part it nothing at all troubles me; for I know in whom I have believed,
and I know, not one hayre of my head ſhall fall to the ground without
his providence; and I have caſt up my account already, what it wil coſt
me; therefore, I weigh not any thing that can be inflicted on mee; for
I know, that God made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to ſing in the Stockes at midnight,
will alſo make mee rejoyce in my chaynes; but it is very much that
they will let none come to me, to bring me any thing; it ſeemes, they
will be more cruell to me than the very <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagan Romans</hi> were
to <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he was in Priſon, did never refuſe to let any come to
him to adminiſter to his neceſſities; but I weigh it not, for I know my
God is and will be with me, to make me goe through all my afflictions
with cheerfulneſſe, for I feele his power within me ſo mightily ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and upholding me, that no condition in this world can make mee
miſerable; and for mine own part I do no more ſet by my life &amp; blood
in this cauſe, then I doe a piece of bread when I have newly dyned.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the woman telling me ſhe hoped I ſhould not have ſo
ſore a puniſhment laid on me but that I might have things brought me
from my friends, I told her, I did not much care how it went with me,
for <hi>Ieremyes Dungeon,</hi> or <hi>Daniels Den,</hi> or the three <hi>Childrens Fornace,</hi> is as
pleaſant and welcome to me as a Palace; for whereſoever I am, I ſhall
find God there, and if I have him, that is enough to me; and for victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
I told her, I did not doubt, but that God that fed the Prophet <hi>Eſiah</hi>
by a <hi>Raven,</hi> would preſerve me, and fill me to the full by the way of his
providence; and if no meat ſhould be brought me, I knew, if they take
away my meat, God will take away my ſtomack; therefore I weighed
not their cruelty, and thereupon uttered to her theſe foure verſes:
<q>
                  <l>I doe not feare nor dread the face of any mortall man,</l>
                  <l>Let him againſt me bend his power, and do the worſt be can,</l>

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:96031:22"/>
For my whole truſt, ſtrength, confidence, My hope, and all my aide,</l>
                  <l>Is in the Lord IEHOVAS fence, which Heaven and earth hath made.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The reſt that I intended by the ſtrength of my God to have ſpoken (if
I had not beene prevented by the <hi>Gag</hi>) I now forbeare to ſet downe, in
regard I heare I am to come into the field again to fight a ſecond battel,
