            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There was that tyme dwellynge in the cite of Rome a phylosopher named Socrates, poore &amp; wyse, whyche came to themperour &amp; sayd.

The fyrst is this, it is not vnknowen to the that the Emperoure her father myght haue had for thy delyueraunce great good, and for as moche as she was vntrue to her owne father and true to the, it semeth well that thou sholde not trust longe in her, for who is false to her owne father, by reason shold be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry false and vntrue to an other man. The second reason is thys. The cause why she delyuered the out of pryson it was neyther for pyte nor for loue, but for flesshly lust that she had to the. For at thy delyueraunce she made couenaunt wyth the to be thy wyfe, and had of the thy trouth, and therfore sone it is not reason that she shold be thy wyfe.

sayd.

Loo for thys cause I haue delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hym, therfore I am kynder to hym than thou that art hys owne father, &amp; he is more beholden to me than to the. Unto that other reason, where as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayst that I delyuered hym bycause of flesshly lust. I answere and saye playnli that it is not trouth. For al maner of flessh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly loue is cause of strengthe, or else of fayrnes, but thy sone is not stronge, for his enprysonment hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye hys strengthe.

            <p>SOmtyme in Rome dwelled a myghty emperour named Dunstane, in whose empyre dwelled a

gentyll knyght that had two sones. One of hys sones wedded hymselfe agaynst hys fathers wyll vnto a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune woman of the bordell. The knyght hearing this exyled hys sone from hym. And whan he was thus exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led he begote on thys woman a sone. And soone after that he wexed sycke &amp; nedefull, wherfore he sente mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers to hys father, besechynge hym of hys mercy. Thys hearynge hys father, had compassyon and rushe on hym, wherfore he was reconsyled. And whan he was thus brought agayne vnto hys fathers grace, he gaue hys sone whych he had begoten to fore on this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune woman to hys father. And he full kyndly recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it as hys sone, and nourysshed it. Whan hys other sone herde this, he sayd to hys father. Father quod he, it semeth that thou art out of thy ryght mynde, whych I wyll proue by this reason. For he is out of his ryght mynde that receyueth a false heyre, &amp; nouryssheth hym whose father hath done hym anguysshe and disease to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For my brother whyche begate thys chylde hath done the great iniury whan he wedded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man agaynst thy wyll and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, therfore me semeth that thou arte out of thy ryght mynde. Than answered the father and sayd. Bycause thy brother is reconsyled thou art enuyous to me &amp; also vnkynde to thyne owne brother, wyllynge to put hym from my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawshyp for euermore, and sothly none vnkynde man shall haue myne herytage but yf he be reconsyled. But yet thou neuer reconsyled hym of hys vnkyndnes, for thou myght haue reconsyled hym, but thou woldest not therfore of myne herytage getest thou no parte.</p>
            <p>¶The father of the two bretherne betokeneth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And his two sones betokeneth the nature

For man was wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune woman of the bordell whan he ete of the apple agaynst the commaundement of god, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was exyled by the father of heuen and put fro the ioyes of paradyse. The sone of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune woman betokeneth mankynde. This knyghtes sone, that is to saye Adam began to be nedefull, for after hys synne he was put from ioye in to thys wretched valey of teares and wepynge, accordynge to thys scripture. In sudore vultus. &amp;c. In the swete of thy vysage thou shalte eate thy breed. But after by the passyon of Chryst he was reconsyled. But the other sone that betokeneth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll was euer vnkynde, &amp; grutched dayly agaynst our reconsylynge, sayinge that by synne we ought not to comme vnto the herytage of heuen.

            <p>SOmtyme dwelled in Rome a myghty Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour named Donate, whyche dyd do make thre ymages, of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whyche one helde out hys hande streyght vnto the people, and had on his fynger a rynge of gold The seconde ymage had a berde of golde. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thyrde had a mantell of purple, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundynge vpon payne of deth that no man sholde robbe these ymages of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rynge the herde, nor the mantell. It befell afterwarde vpon a tyme that one Dionyse a tyraunt came in to the temple and toke awaye the rynge from the fyrst ymage, the berde from the seconde, &amp; the mantell from the thyrde. And anone whan he had thus done, he was forthwyth accused vnto the Emperoure and brought before hym, and was examyned of that trespace, why he despoyled the ymages agaynst the Emperours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement.
<pb facs="tcp:3327:63"/>
Than answered this Dionyse and sayd. My lorde it is lawfull to answere for my selfe, where as none wyll answere for me, whan I entred in to the temple y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrst ymage helde forth hys hande streyght to me, as who sayth, I gyue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thys rynge, and therfore I toke the rynge at the gyfte of the ymage. And whan I sawe the seconde ymage hauyng a berde, I thought thus wyth in mi selfe. I knewe somtyme the father of this ymage whyche had no berde, and now hys sone hathe a berde whych is agaynst reason, the sone to haue a berde and the father none, &amp; therfore I toke from hym hys berde that he sholde be lyke hys father. After that whan I sawe the thyrde ymage closed in a mantell of golde, I thought that a mantell of golde was not behouable to hym in wynter, for golde is naturally colde, whyche myght because of his deth, and therfore I toke it from hym bycause it was to colde in wynter, and to hote in somer. Whan Dyonyse had excused hym by these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Emperoure answered and sayde. Thou hast answered wyckedly for thy selfe, what sholde cause the rather than ony other man to despoyle these ymages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as moche as I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that no man shold take ony thynge awaye fro them, and thyne owne mouth hath condempned the. And anone the Emperour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to hym one of hys squyers, &amp; charged hym to smyte of hys heed, and so it was done.</p>
            <p>¶ Thys Emperour betokeneth almyghty god the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Thys man is ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher than hys father was, therfore take we hys lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lode fro hym and make hym lyke his fore father. They take also the mantell of golde from the myghty men, whan they se ony man of honour and of good lyuynge wyllynge to correcke suche mysdoers, than saye they. This man is to colde, for he enclyneth nothynge to our opynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and also he is to hote of power in werkynge agaynst vs, therfore go we &amp; take from hym the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of myght, and so they accuse hym and put hym out of offyce.

            <p>THere dwelled somtyme in Rome a myghty Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour named Euas, whych had a fayre yonge lady to hys wyfe, vpon whome he had begoten a fayre sone. Whan the states of the Empyre herde thys, they came vnto the Emperoure and besought hym to haue the kepynge ef hys sone. Anone the Emperoure sente a sergeaunt thrugh out the Cyte, sayinge that in whose house were fyrst founde fyre and water, the good man of that house sholde haue his sone in kepynge &amp; to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshe. And than the Emperour made a proclamacyon that who so euer had his sone to kepe sholde nourysshe hym clenly, and fede hym w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holsom meates &amp; drynkes And whan the chylde came to age, than sholde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keper be promoted to greate honour, wherfore many men let
<pb facs="tcp:3327:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make redy fyre and water, in hope to haue the chylde. But on the nyght whan euery man was a slepe, there came a tyraunt named Sulapius that quenched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyre and threwe out the water. Neuerthelesse amonge all other there was a man named Ionathas that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so diligently that he kepte bothe daye &amp; nyght fyre and water. In a mornynge erly the sergeaunt at the Emperours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement wente thrugh the Cyte &amp; sought in euery house for fyre and water, but he coude fynde none tyll he came to Ionathas house, where as he founde bothe fyre and water redy, wherfore he was brought before the Emperour, and delyuered hym hys sone accordyng to hys proclamacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whan Ionathas had the Emperours sone he ledde hym home vnto hys house. And soone after he sente for masons and carpen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters, and let make a stronge chambre of lyme &amp; stone. And whan the chambre was made, he sente for payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and let paynt on the wall wythin the chambre .x. ymages wyth thys posey wryten aboue theyr heedes. Who so defouleth these ymages shall dye a foule deth. And than he let drawe on the dore a galous, and a fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of hymselfe hangynge thervpon wyth thys posey wryten aboue hys heed. So shall he be serued that nou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryssheth the Emperours sone amysse. Also he let make a chayre of golde, and hymselfe syttynge therin crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wyth a crowne of golde, wyth thys superscripcyon aboue hys heed. Who that nouryssheth the emperours sone clenly, thus shall he be honoured. Whan this was done, oftentymes in his slepe he was tempted to defyle these ymages, but anone he redde the superscrypcyon aboue theyr heedes, &amp; than all the temptacyons seaced And whan the Emperours sone was euyll kepte, than

And whan he behelde the chayre &amp; hymselfe syttynge therin crowned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a crowne of golde he was right ioyful, thynkyng to haue a good reward for kepynge of the Emperours sone. Whan the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour herde of hys diligent demeanour about hys sone he sente for hym &amp; for hys sone, thankynge hym for his well kepynge &amp; nourysshynge of hym, and after promo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted hym to greate honour and worshyp.</p>

            <p>IN Rome dwelled somtyme a myghty Emperoure named Menaly, whyche had wedded the kynges doughter of Hungary, a fayre lady &amp; a gracyous in all her werkes, and specyally she was mercyfull. On a tyme as the Emperour lay in hys bedde, he bethought hym that he wolde go vysyte the holy lande. And on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morowe he called to hym the Empresse hys wyfe &amp; hys owne onely brother, &amp; thus he sayde. Dere lady I may not ne I wyll not hyde from you the preuytees of my herte, I purpose to vysyte the holy lande, wherfore I ordeyne the princypally to be lady and gouernour ouer

Neuerthelesse thys knyght wolde not leue by thys auswere, but euer whan he founde her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he made hys complaynt to her, and stered her by all the wayes that he coude to synne wyth hym.

And than the Empresse toke hym wyth her &amp; many other knyghtes, and so rede forth to mete wyth the Emperoure, and as they rode togyder by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye, they sawe where a great harte ran afore them, wherfore euery man wyth suche houndes as they had chased hym on horsbacke, so that wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empresse was lefte no creature, saue onely the Emperours brother, whyche seynge that no man was there but they two, thus he sayd vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empresse.

O my lorde beholde in yonder ladyes hande a wonderfull thynge.

Anone the good man of the house herde hym, and asked the cause of hys knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, and what he wolde haue.

Whan the Emperoure had herde the very trewth of thys mater, he sayd vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erle. Thys yonge man quod he, shal abyde here wyth me. The erle anone graunted, though it was greatly agaynst hys wyll. And whan the feest was ended, euery man toke hys leue at the Emperoure, and wente where as them lyst. And at that tyme it fortuned that the Empresse &amp; her doughter soiourned in a greate countre farre fro thens by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Emperoure.

Whan he had ryd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thre or foure dayes on his iourney, in an euenynge he came vnto a castell where as dwelled a knyght, and prayed hym mekely of a nightes lodynge.

Alas quod he, it is great pyte to slee suche a fayre yonge man, and therfore yf I may, it shall not be so.

Whan the knyght had thus wryten, he closed the letters subtylly &amp; put them in to the boxe agayne. Erly in the mornynge the yonge squyer arose and hastely made hym redy, and toke hys leue of the knyght, and rode forth on hys iourney, and the thyrde daye after he came vnto the Empresse, and salewed her ryght worshypfully in the Emperours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and toke her the letters.
