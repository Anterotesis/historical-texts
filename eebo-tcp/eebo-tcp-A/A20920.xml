            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SVch as of late yeares have rent themſelues from the holie ſervice of God, uſed im the publique congregations and Churches of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, being deſtitute of any ſound warrant from the worde of God, have ſought from time to time ſo much the more earneſtly (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſuch is) to ſhroude themſelves vnder the ſhadowe of humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it came to paſſe that Maſter Francis Iunius, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great learning, and godlineſſe, was ſolicited by ſome of them (as may appeare by theſe letters enſuing) in the yeare 99. to be a favourer of their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious opinions and of their vnchriſtian diſordered and vndutifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: whoſe anſwere, being delivered by himſelfe to a religious and worſhipful knight, and ſo comming to my handes, I have preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to communicate with thee, by the motion of ſome godly and well diſpoſed, hoping that through the bleſſing of God, and thy prayers it may proove a good meanes to ſtay ſuch as are wavering, to confirme ſuch as doe ſtand, and to recover ſuch as are fallen. For although he doe not enter into an exact diſcuſſing of the queſtion with arguments, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and anſweres: yet he vſeth a very grave and godly admonition, which is oftentimes of greater fruite, then a long and learned diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And whoſoever doth diligently ſtudie the booke of God, ſhal finde, that the holy Prophets &amp; Apoſtles do in manie places inſiſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a plaine &amp; ſimple aſleve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, if we obſerve the ſtory of the holy Martyrs of our own Church &amp; others, we may preceive that by the ſound profeſſion of their faith, and ſuffering for the ſame, they have glorified God and advanced the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt aſwel as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done by arguments and reaſons. And yet notwithſtanding if thou do well obſerue theſe letters of Maſter Iunius, thou ſhalt finde in them not vaine and emptie wordes: but waightie and ſounde reaſons grounded upon the holie Scriptures of God. Thus praying thee to take theſe firſt fruites of my poore laboures in this kinde in good part, and beſeching god to give a bleſſing hereunto; I bid thee heartily farewel in the Lord.</p>

               <p>The Engliſh exiles in the Low countreys, wiſh grace and peace in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>THis true confeſſion of our faith, in our judgment wholy agreable to the ſacred Scripture, we do here exhibit vnto all to be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and vnto you (reverend Sirs) we dedicate it for two cauſes. Firſt, for that we know you are able in reſpect of your ſingular knowledge in the Scriptures, and hope you are willing in reſpect of your ſyncere piety, to convince our errours by the light of Gods word, if in any thing we be out of the way. Secondly, that this teſtimony of Chriſtian faith, if you alſo fynd it agree with the word of truth, may by you be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, eyther in ſilence or by writing, as you ſhall think beſt.</p>
               <p>It may be, we ſhalbe thought very bold, that being deſpiſed of all, yet doubted not to ſollicite you ſo many and ſo great learned men. But this we did, partly at the requeſt of others to whom we would not deny it: partly with deſier to have the truth through your help better defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and further ſpread abroad: partly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreyned by our exile and other calamityes almoſt infinite: partly alſo moved with love of our native cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, and of theſe wherein now we live, and others elſe where: wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all may walk with a right foot to the truth of the Goſpell, and praying daily vnto God, that the great work of reſtoring Religion and the Church decayed, which he hath happily begun in theſe latter ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, by our Gracious Soveraigne and the other Princes of theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes and ages (his ſervants) he would fully accompliſh, to the glory of his name and eternall ſalvation in Chriſt of his elect in all places of the earth.</p>
               <p>As for the cauſes which moved vs to publiſh this Confeſſion of faith, and to forſake the Church of England as now it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, we have truly and as briefly as we could related them in the Preface to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hereafter following: and therefore thought here to omit the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of them. The Lord Ieſus alway preſerve you and your Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſityes to the praiſe of his name, the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of good learning, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and maintenance of his pure Religion.

               <p>IT may ſeeme ſtrange vnto thee (Chriſtian Reader) that any off the Englyſh nation ſhould for the truth of the Goſpell be forced to forſake their natyve contrye / and lyve in exile / eſpecially in theſe dayes / when the Goſpell ſeemeth to have free paſſage / and floriſh in that land. And for this cauſe have our exile bene hardly thought of by many / and evil ſpoken of by ſome who know not (as it ſeemeth) eyther the trewe eſtate of the Church of England or cauſes of our forſaking and ſeparating from the ſame / but hearing this ſect (as they call it) to be every where ſpoken againſt have (with out at all further ſearch) accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and divulged vs as heretickes / or Schiſmatickes at the leaſt.<note place="margin">Act. 28, 22</note> Yea ſome (and ſuch as worſt might) have ſought the increaſe of our afflictions / even here alſo yf they could, which thinge they have / both ſecretly and openly attempted.

requeſtes, anſweres, admonitions, and finally all our duties, although (as it commeth to paſſe, and is incident to man) diſagreeing from our ſenſe and taſte.</p>
            <p>I obſerue therefore that there are three heads or chief poynts in your little booke, wherein you deſire our counſell and iudgement. The firſt head is of doctrine, which you profeſſe in your little booke. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is of fact, whereof yee accuſe the Engliſh Churches. Laſtly the third is, of the concluſion, which you inferre by comparing that your doctrine with that practiſe of England; namely that yee cannot with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience entertaine a communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thoſe Churches, but that yee doe abhorre them with all your heartes. Therefore I will ſpeak briefely of theſe 3. things,<note n="“" place="margin">Vt ſentio.</note> what I think, entreating you brotherly to take my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in good part.</p>
            <p>I marvell that the point of doctrine, or little booke of your confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beloved brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is ſent ouer to me. I marvell that it was ſent ouer to all the ſtudents of holy Scriptures in all Chriſtian Vniuerſities; for if there be a certaine conſent of doctrine as you pretend it, truely I do not ſee what need there was, that you ſhould ſet forth a newe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in this conſent of holy and auncient doctrine. But if there be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention peradventure in the doctrine, or rather a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that in deed ought not to bee diſſembled, if ſo be that yee thought it neceſſarie, that your doctrine ſhould be declared.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in that you ſend to mee; yea that you ſend to publicke viewe, <note n="“" place="margin">Confeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note>your confeſſion, I marvell, brethren, yea I greatly maruell, what your meaning ſhould bee, both in reſpect of the ende and the fact. For if ye haue ſet it foorth to that end, that yee might purge your ſelues, I pray you brethren, wherefore doe yee deſire, to purge your ſelues with ſo many ſoules; who have not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you as yet to bee accuſed; who can neuer take knowledge of the right or wrong of your accuſation; and who are not called vnto it by any lawfull means? and (that which is worſe) wherfore would yee haue this done before ſo many<note n="“" place="margin">Infeſtis.</note> deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to God and the Church, who thirſt after nothing ſo much as the blood of the Church of God, and doe reioyce that we vndiſcreetly make a publiſhing of theſe wounds: that they by theſe very wounds might ſpoyle the Church, that pretious bodie of Chriſt, of the blood of veritie, and juyce of charitie? Finally, why doe yee this before ſo many weake ones, who not yet knowing, that yee are borne (as I may ſo ſay) are offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, rather with a carcaſſelike ſtink of ſchiſmes in the Church, before they knowe certainely the bodie whereunto they may cleaue?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5697:18"/>
Alas brethren, is your purgation ſo much worth vnto you that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publicke good of the Church ſhould bee brought into ſo greate danger? A Chriſtian an humble, and godly minde ought to bee otherwiſe affected, and ſetting aſide the reſpect of their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate good, conſtantly thus to determine, let the earth rather firſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe me vp (as the Poet ſaith) and let mee rather bee accurſed for my brethren, then that by me, and for my credit ſake even one of theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones ſhould be offended and kept from comming to Chriſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in Chriſt my Sauiour. Verily let what will of my eſtimation goe to wracke, who am a Chriſtian, let me be trampled vnder all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s feete, ſo that by my fact, I take nothing from Chriſt, from his body, no not the leſt thing. <note n="“" place="margin">

But the end which you have in common, alas for griefe, in this particular caſe (pardon if I ſpeake more freely, for yee would have me to ſpeak) from it yee ſeeme to have erred. For herein, if I ſee anie thing, the contemplation of your cauſe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved you, which thing I truſt yee your ſelves without doubt will marke if ye would goe a little from that your particular ſenſe<note n="“" place="margin">A cauſa veſtra.</note> from your cauſe.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed that there is ſome errour in that end. Let vs come to the fact. In the fact yee frame a purgation of your ſelues. That thing is denyed to none, if there be cauſe, if meaſure, if place, if time. But where fore with mee brethren, who doe neither heare theſe accuſations of yours; neither if I ſhould heare them, would I receive them raſhly? Wherefore in publick? where yee knowe that it falleth out for the moſt part, that they who purge them ſelues, before they be accuſed, eyther bewray the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or raiſe ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt themſelues more eaſely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can afterward waſh away. Yee knowe that the publicke voice is neither a iuſt iudge oftentimes, nor at any time almoſt a lawfull Iudge; ſo greatly doth evil preuaile and beare ſway in the publick. Therefor yee appeale to theſe Iudges, who can neither iudge, not take knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge: finally, they are not onely no Iudges, but not ſo much as witneſſes: ſo the private cauſe is not furthered, and the publique is many waies hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Ye will ſay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſhall bee? What judges, what witneſſes ſhal we call vpon? Your owne preface ſhall anſwere yee for me.

where you haue a lodging, and a quiet ſeate that there in deed you muſt receiue the iudgement of your doctrine and faith, if ye will have the ſame lawfully knowne and approoued. Ye are in a Church furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the ſervants of God, whoſe pietie, learning, and brotherly loue to the members of Chriſt good men doe know. It is an vnlawfull courſe verily, to omit thoſe among whom yee are and to call upon an other Church, or the whole publik ſtate, <note n="“" place="margin">Aut Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiam hanc.</note>or this Vniverſity, or me who am a weake member therein, either in part, or in common. This order is godly, iuſt, lawfull, and tendeth to peace, and edification, which you ought firſt, modeſtly to have regarded, and to which I being a weake brother, am bounden by brotherly duetie, to recall my brethren, that goe aſtray, and not to be caried headlong, and to ruſh vpon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things by this meanes offred; beſides all equitie and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Till ye ſhall doe this, I admoniſh, exhort, pray, and beſeech by the moſt ſacred &amp; holy name of Chriſt, that ye would not call vpon me, neither any other, neither the publick it ſelf: for by this prepoſterous courſe (as we may ſo ſay) ye do not disburthen your ſelues, as ye thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, of enuy and blame (if there be any) but ye doe with ſuſpition and praejudice burthen your owne cauſe, <note n="“" place="margin">Cui ego quide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nullu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praejudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> facio, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſe dico coram Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino.</note>which I verily do not preiudice at all, I ſpeak it religiouſly before the Lord.

            <p>I come to the accuſation which yee uſe againſt the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as ye write. In this accuſation beloued brethren, I doe louingly entreat you, that yee would not take it in ill part, if I doe admoniſh yee of a few things which I thinke, I may of right doe. Firſt, what need is there, that yee ſhould accuſe them? Yee haue giuen place, yee haue (as wee may ſo ſpeake) paſſed ouer into another Court: Wherefore you haue giuen place, no body deſireth to know, or doth trouble you.

of accuſation? Why are yee not quiet being without the daunger of any hurt? Why doe yee not rather paſſe ouer the iniury that is paſt? Why doe yee not beare it (if there be yet any) in ſilence and hope, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to mooue that which is in reſt? It is plainely a Chriſtian part, if thou beare it, and a prudent part, if thou abſtaine from ſtirring the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill that is well appeaſed, an impotent thing, if thou doe contrariwiſe.<note place="margin">Impotens.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And to what end I pray you is it? To the end that you might purge your ſelues? But here is no man that doth repeate anew, or lay theſe accuſations againſt you. Wherefore ſerueth this purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? that yee may be euen with them againſt whom yee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine? But this is not the part of a Chriſtian. I doe not thinke that this is your meaning. Is it to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me them? This indeed is an holy endeuour. But if yee could not doe this when yee were preſent, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what yee can doe when yee are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But firſt of all conſider with your ſelues, by what meanes yee take this way, namely to accuſe to me, to others, to the publike, in the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Church, in the circle of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ah beloued brethren, was it euer heard of, that any priuate man (to ſay nothing of a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie) was euer amended by this courſe Further conſider I pray you before whom yee bring theſe things.

For if as an interceſſor, were it not better that your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is moſt manifeſt, that they againſt whom yee deale, wil be more prouoked <note n="“" place="margin">Hoc gravi aculeo.</note>by this grieuous ſting If as an examiner, by what right can I doe it? who haue no lawful authority from God, from the Church, from the Magiſtrate, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: neither if it ſhould be committed, would I eaſily accept it; I am ſo privie to my ſelfe, of my owne inſufficiencie; for who am I? or what am I? that I ſhould be able, throughly to ſee euery particular thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, and them, which are required to a iuſt examination. And this the right courſe of examination doth require, otherwiſe (as <hi>Seneca</hi> wiſely ſaith) he that judgeth one party being not heard, albeit he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that which is right, yet he is vniuſt. Yee are not a little deceiued in this your iudgement beloued brethren: Yee almoſt do me an iniury, when ye call me to be a buſie body, or think that I wil take upon me the part of an examiner, or (that which is more ſubject to envie and farre from duetie) of a Iudge. And brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that which I ſay of my ſelfe,

thinke that is the anſwere of the other brethren<note n="“" place="margin">Qui vbiuis locorum ſunt.</note> which are any where els in Churches and Vniverſities. No wiſe man will raſhly goe downe theſe ſteps, or clime vp to this ſeate of judgement. In deed concerning your faith and doctrine ſomething may be ſaid, if you expound it, and if the thing be done in order.

               <hi>GRace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Reverend Sr. and beloved brother in Chriſt / we have lately received your letter / which you ſent vnſealed to the Miniſters of the Dutch and fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Churches / that it might firſt be read of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and them be delyvered to vs. We have alſo read and weighed it / and thought it meet to wryte agayne / partly to thank you that vouched ſafe to write vnto vs: partly to ſatisfy you (if we can) in ſome thinges wherein we ſee you are miſtaken: In the wryting wherof / we humbly requeſt that ſpeaking freely that which the thing it ſelf requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you would take it in good part / as you are woo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Many thinges indeed you have wrytten which we do willingly acknowledg and conſent therein with you. Thoſe we will not touch at all. The reſt we will proſequute in the ſame order / as by your ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey are propounded.</p>
            <p>Whereas there was a litle booke exhibited vnto you by one of vs / it is not ſo to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / as if you were called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>alone or apart from others.</hi> For the brother which delyvered you the booke certified vs / that this paſſed betwene you / that by you it ſhould be communicated with your Colleagues the governours of that Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity / and that you tooke vpon you to do it. Now if you have ſo done / how is it that you alone wryte back againe? why alſo do you ſo often repeat and ſeeme to reprehend that you / you (we ſay) alone / apart / are called vpon? If you have not done it / mynde then on whome the blame lyeth that it is not communicated with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that Vniverſity / to whome by vs it was dedicated.

The one of theſe we take it muſt needes be donne. And we gather it by comparing together <hi>Iam. 5.19.12. with Iude ver. 3.</hi> This alſo is the very thing which we did deſire and ſtill do deſire in that Epiſtle dedicatory. And let theſe thinges once ſpoken / ſuffyce (we pray you) for the crimination of calling on you <hi>apar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> which in this letter of yours you have ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> objected and repeated.</p>
            <p>Next you propound <hi>three tinges</hi> to be conſidered in the booke it ſelf / of which you promyſe to ſpeake / briefly and brotherly / what you thinke.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The firſt head (you ſay) is of <hi>the doctrine,</hi> which we profeſſe in our booke. Be it ſo indeed. Here we expected (becauſe you purpoſe to wryte of the doctrine we profeſſe) that you would have diſcuſſed the articles of our fayth / and reproved the errours (if there be any) by the light of Gods word. And who would not have expected this? But behold / there is not a word of the doctrine and fayth it ſelf. What may this meane? Is it becauſe your ſelf beleeu this faith to be trew-sound grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on the word of God and agreable thervnto? If ſo why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wryting theſe thinges / do you not profeſſe it? Why do you diſſemble it? ſpecially / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you heare that this fayth is traduced as ſchiſme / as hereſy? but you ſee perhaps that in the doctrine of faith we erre from the truth. If it be ſo / why then wryte you / and yet ſhew not the errours? why do you not (as much as in you is) bring into the way ſuch as do erre? Do not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> requeſt is made that the errours may be ſhewed by the light of the holy Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Certainly your godlynes perſwadeth otherwiſe: yea / God himſelf requireth otherwiſe. <hi>Iam. 5.19.20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:5697:22"/>Yet now when you touch not the doctrine it ſelf / what is it that you wryte in this behalf? Even this only / that you would perſwade we have erred herein <hi>that we have publyſhed the confesſion of our faith.</hi> Firſt of al this concerneth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner / not the matter it ſelf. But yet let vs weigh your reaſons: <hi>If</hi> (ſay you) <hi>there be a certayne conſent of doctrine: then there was no need that we ſhould ſet forth a new Confeſſion in this agreement of holy and ancient doctrine.</hi> Doe you indeed ſpeak as you thinke? How is it then that ſome while ſynce / when the Germane and French Churches had before publyſhed their Confeſſions of fayth / yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Belgick / Scotiſh / and other Churches ſet forth theirs alſo / not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding that they agreed with them in the holy and anncient doctrine? Yea tell vs (we pray you) what you think of that godly and learned Mr. Beza his pryvate Confeſſion of fayth lately publyſhed? Not to ſpeake of many other wrytten and divulged by many of the martyrs alſo / in their ſeverall ages. Do not all theſe agree in the holy and anncyent doctrine of Godlynes? Or ſhould not therfore theſe Confeſſions have bene publyſhed? What ſoever you ſhall ſay for them / mynd the ſame alſo as ſpoken for vs. Secondly you ſay, <hi>if there be any diſſention in doctrine, that ought not to be diſſembled, &amp;c.</hi> But what is this to vs / who have playnely ſhewed and reckned vp the thinges wherein we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Church of England / with whom we have to do in this behalf? Neyther that only / but have alſo in our Confeſſion not obſcurely ſignified / con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the thinges wherein the other Churches of this city and ours as yet do not agree.</p>
            <p>After theſe thinges / you come to diſcuſſe <hi>the end and fact</hi> of our publyſhing this Confeſſion. Touching <hi>the end,</hi> we have ſhewed it in the epiſtle and preface ſet before the booke it ſelf. And we anſwer further / that we did this to the ſame end / that all the reformed Churches of late did publyſh theirs. For proof wherof / let the preface of the Harmony of Confeſſions / compared with ours / ſpeak for vs. If you take away the reaſons by both alleadged / we yeeld. But if you cannot / then ſee whether both here and other where often in this letter you do not through our ſydes ſtrike at all theſe Churches lykewiſe. Our <hi>cauſe and cleering,</hi> we commyt to God and to all godly that love the truth. Such as before knewe not our cauſe they may now by this meanes have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therof. Such as be enemyes of God / of the Church / of the truth / have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this book of ours / wherof to rejoyce. They will rather be grieved when thus they ſhall ſee Antichriſt that man of ſynne to be more and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered / whom the Lord in the end will wholy conſume and abolyſh / with the ſpirit of his mouth in the teſtimony (not in the ſilence) of his ſervants. <hi>2. Theſ. 2.8.</hi> with <hi>Rev. 12.11.</hi> and <hi>14 6 7 8.</hi> and <hi>20.4.</hi> Fynally / ſuch as be weak and by reaſon of the ſtink of ſchiſmes know not the true body of Chriſt whervnto they ſhould joyne themſelves / they may by this meanes be better inſtructed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more certainly to know and imbrace the true Church and fayth of Chriſt. Thus deſyre we that the publyck good of the Church be holye forward / that Chriſt may have the preeminence over all. And thus have we ſpoken of the end / in which as yet we ſee not any miſtaking or errour.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>the fact,</hi> we anſwer in lyke maner as before concerning the end. Yea and the thinges which here you bring / for not doing it in publyck / you may vrge the very ſame lykewiſe againſt all the reformed Churches / againſt <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Origen, Auguſtine, Tertullian,</hi> and others of the fathers / againſt <hi>Zuinglius, Luther, Calvine, Beza,</hi> and many other of theſe ages / godly men / and divers of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5697:22"/>
them alſo Martyrs of Ieſus Chriſt: who have ſet forth in publyck their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of fayth private their apologies complaynts / diſputations / yea and their letters concerning matters in religion publyckly controverted. But theſe things perhaps came not in your mynd / whiles there was before your eyes only the contemplation of our particular cauſe: which thing your ſelf (we truſt) will perceive / if you turne your eyes a lytle from vs vnto others approved by your ſelf. Moreover howſoever the evill (wherof you wryte) do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayte in publyck: yet alwayes and every where wiſdome is juſtified of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren / as Chriſt hath taught / <hi>Mat. 11.16.19.</hi> And this ſhall ſuffice vs and all that are godly. Laſtly / in a caſe of ſuch weight and neceſſity / who ſhould rather be called vpon then the ſtudents of the holy Scriptures in Chriſtian vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſityes? Who (we pray you) are eſteemed to be of better or ſounder judgment? Whome doth it more concerne to take knowledg / of the truth and errours in religion? Who ſhould better inſtruct in the truth / or convince falſhoold? And to conclude / who can or ought to attend more to the diſcuſſing of theſe things?</p>
            <p>But you object / that <hi>ſeeing we have here found place of reſt, here alſo we muſt receive the judgment of our doctrine and fayth, if we will have the ſame law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully knowen and approved, &amp;c.</hi> Here come many things to be conſidered. Firſt what if the reſt and breathing / which here we enjoye / come vnto vs / not by the Miniſters (of whome you ſpeak) but by the Magiſtrats: which we do alwayes and every where acknowledg with thanckes. Secondly what if theſe miniſters (men indeed learned and wiſe) ſhould be of the ſame mynd with you / that they would not heare or ſpeake any thing concerning our fayth and cauſe: inaſmuch as they would not be eyther <hi>interceſſours, or exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Iudges?</hi> Furthermore / what if our Confeſſion of fayth have ben exhibited to them above three yeares ſynce / that by them it might eyther be approved / or the errours (if there be any) convinced? What if ſome of them have denounced vs as hereticks and ſchiſmaticks? What if they have received certayne articles full of lyes and ſclaunders / ſpread abroad againſt vs / and yet to this daye have not gyven vs a copy of them / no though they were deſyred? What if vpon occaſion offered we have dealt with them touching certaine corruptions yet remayning in their Churches / which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they would not ſo much as acknowledg? And finally / what if we after the concealing and not regarding of all theſe thinges / have now agayne this laſt yeare delyvered them the Confeſſion of our fayth in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting / before it was put forth in print? You ſee what we could anſwer in this behalf: but we would rather have burned theſe thinges in forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / if you had not ſo vrged vs as from you they might not now be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Pardon you therfore and let them alſo (we intreat) pardon vs / that we ſpeak freely: for you would have vs ſpeak / yea you conſtreyne vs againſt our will to wryte theſe things / which we would have covered in ſilence / ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hereafter for better. Beſydes theſe / we anſwer alſo that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before our Confeſſion is ſignified / that not here only but almoſt every where we are traduced as heretickes / and ſchiſmaticks: and that therfore it concerned vs / to declare our fayth and cauſe not to theſe only but vnto all. The very thing which before vs on lyke occaſion (as is aforeſaid) both dyvers of the ffathers have don of old / and in later wines almoſt all the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches / and of the Martyrs not a few.</p>

our fayth: Which how weak they are now judg your ſelf. But ſuppoſe they were ſtrong / and that therfore herein we had erred / that our Confeſſion came forth in publyck: yet now it is publyſhed / the errours (if any be found in it) are certeynly to be ſhewed and convinced by the word of God.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe you may eaſily gather that we ſhall be more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in this fayth. And ſeing you (Learned Sr.) do purpoſely wryte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Doctrine which we profeſſe / and yet ſhew not any one errour in the Doctrine: conſider wel what you have done. Will you be ready to help them who erre (as you think) in the manner and circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces? and will you afford no help at all in the matter and fayth it ſelf? Far be this from you from your godlynes learning / wiſdome / charity. And thus much of the firſt poynt which you noted concerning doctrine.</p>

Is this ſuch an hainous and capitall fault with you? bee it farre from you Brethren, bee it farre from you to take that courſe with good men, which God, reaſon, and the times haue taught vs to be daungerous. Raſh and headie iudgements are not to be required, not to bee endured, not to be heard. That God of truth might iuſtly puniſh vs, if caſting a ſide diſcretion (which is moſt needefull in theſe times) wee ſhould anſwere alwayes to all queſtions according to the lawes preſcribed by ſuch as propounde the ſame.

Of all which things / now let the Reader judge. If you aſke / why we chaunged our purpoſe / and have now ſent you this letter / which was wrytten ſo longe ſynce: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherevpon we are conſtreyned / not only to ſend theſe wrytten vnto you / but to ſet them forth in publyck alſo in the Engliſh tounge. Yet let nothing here offend you: for it is we / if any / that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juried yea and the truth it ſelf: inaſmuch as your firſt letter was publyſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone / without our anſwer which you receyved from vs. By whoſe fault / to what end / with what equitie / mynd you well. Sure that Prieſt which tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated yours / wryteth in his preface (how truly you know) that your ſelf delyve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the copy of your firſt letter to a worſhipfull knight / of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he receved it / and

But perhaps in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you purpoſed one thing / he another. Whatſoever it were / now you cannot but ſee / how the Prelats and Prieſts of our countrey do ſo interpret your letters / as if they had bene wrytten againſt the truth of the Goſpell of Chriſt / which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe / and for defence of the Antichriſtian Apoſtaſy and tyranny / wherein they perſiſt. Which thing we leave vnto you / to be weighed ſeriouſly before the Lord.</p>
            <p>Neyther is it to be omitted / that your private letters are ſet forth in publyck: yours (we ſay) who took it ſo yll that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of fayth of this whole Church ſhould be made publyck: whom theſe very letters of yours wrote ſo much <hi>of the publyck view, of publiſhing the woundes of the Church, vndiſcreetly, before ſo many deadly enemyes of God and the Church: of not offending any one of Chriſts diſciples of not provoking Churches: of every one abounding in their owne ſence, &amp;c.</hi> It is marvell if your tranſlatour turne not your owne wordes vpon your ſelf and tell you / <hi>that a Chriſtian an humble and godly mind ought to be otherwiſe affected, and ſetting a ſide the reſpect of their owne pryvate regard. &amp;c.</hi> But this the more vnjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he made your letters publyck without your knowledg. Which we indeed at firſt did ſuſpect: tyll we ſaw your ſecond Epiſtle come forth ſome while after the other. Neyther could we well thinke other wiſe of the matter / ſpecially ſeing you wrote vnto vs / <hi>that we might rent the letters, and that you alſo would conceale it.</hi> Knowe moreover / that in the edition of your letters / there be certeyne clauſes wherin the tranſlation is not anſwerable to yours in latine ſent vnto vs: which we by your originall amend in our edition nowe ready to be publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Theſe (and many other things which yet we conceale) ſeem vnto vs to be of ſome moment.

            <p>AN huge bundell of letters, beloved brethren, I received from you yeſterday in the evening. I gave you counſell to reſt from queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: you commaund me to enter into queſtions. I continew ſtill in my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for I eſteem more of peace in the Church then of the ſeeds of ſtrife: they that are fedde with theſe ſeeds, ſhall reap the fruit. Where you conclude and pronounce that I do therefore aſſent vnto you, it is a falſe concluſion: As towching the matter I have enjoyned my ſelf ſilence: and although I be an hundred tymes called vpon by letters, I will continew ſtill in the argument of counſell till I ſee another courſe taken. If it like you not, let it alone: neyther do I like the handling of queſtions in this tyme. It is more according to God that I be ſilent from queſtions in this eſtate of things, then that I powre forth my ſelf and you together into them. You move many things in your letters, I wil reſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe things, and will occupy my ſelf religiouſly in the work of the Lord. Chriſtian wiſdome will never ſuffer me to ſpeak of queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s controverted, the one party being vnheard.</p>
            <p>That my letters vnto you, were tranſlated into Engliſh, I have now firſt knowen it by you: I knew not that it was done. You object that my letters were not ſhewed by you. I beleev it: for both by letters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of many I have ben certifyed that they were not ſhewed. If it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe you, ſhew them, for me you may. All ſhall ſee, how falſe reports have ben given forth concerning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I neyther am aſhamed of them, neyther ever will be. But I pitty you (I ſpeak it vnfeynedly) who for my letters give forth in publick your concluſions. With good men good dealing ſhould be uſed. That the copyes of my letters were carryed into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, your ſelves may eaſily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>jecture, by what meanes it came to paſſe. About te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moneths ſynce, the Soveraign Quenes Ambaſſadour was there and two of your company dined with him. What hapned at that dinner you can remember. He came hither vnto me: he marveled at the fact of your departure: I told him that I had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto you, he deſired a copy. To you I gave counſell: whoſoever gave it forth in publick, hath done it without my knouwledg: I will not anſwer for an others doing, but for

myne owne. In the meane while I will pray God that he frame your mynds vnto the truth, wiſdome, love, and peace, and all our mynds vnto his glory. Farewell in the Lord. From Leyden in Holland.</p>

And thus we pray God that he would guyde you together with vs and all his alway vnto Ieſus Chriſt / and that he would keep vs in him / who onely is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> Whoſe name be bleſſed for ever.
