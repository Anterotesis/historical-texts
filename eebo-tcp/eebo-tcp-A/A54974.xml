         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Dialogue between H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MPHREY and ROGER,
About Chuſing the Next Parliament.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>WEll met, Neighbour <hi>Hodge:</hi>
How do'ſt do? We have
ſtrange News, man; Do'ſt hear it? What do'ſt
think, but the Parliament's Diſſolv'd again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Ay! Is it ſo! By my Brown Cow
then, <hi>Numps,</hi> I think our Stateſmen now-a-days
take <hi>Parliaments</hi> for <hi>Nine-Pins,</hi> which they <hi>Set
up,</hi> like the Boys, onely to <hi>Knock down again</hi> for
ſport.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>Hold you there, Neighbour: for
whether the Boys learn of our Stateſmen, or
our Stateſmen of the Boys, is too hard a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
for us to Reſolve. This I'm ſure of, they
could never indure the breath of a <hi>Parliament,</hi>
ſince they diſcover'd the <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> which
makes me think thoſe <hi>Stateſmen</hi> had <hi>a finger
in't,</hi> and are mad to ſee ſuch a <hi>hopeful Project</hi>
in danger of miſcarrying. But prethee tell me,
which be theſe <hi>Stateſmen?</hi> Are they thoſe of
the K's <hi>Private Council?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>No, you Fool; they are call'd the
<hi>Private Council,</hi> becauſe every thing of moment
is kept <hi>private</hi> from them. You may ſee by the
Proclamation for this Diſſolution, that they did
not know of it, till it was Reſolv'd. But the
<hi>Stateſmen</hi> are call'd by a Name which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
forgot, ſomewhat like <hi>Cupboard-Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and in truth are a ſort of <hi>Whiſperers,</hi> that
Adviſe ſuch things in <hi>Private,</hi> that they dare
not <hi>own,</hi> and cannot <hi>juſtifie</hi> with reaſon, in <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>But what kind of men are theſe?
For I never ſaw any of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Troth nor I, ſince they were ſo; but
whilſt they were honeſt Countrey Lords or
Gentlemen, as all <hi>Stateſmen</hi> muſt be, before
they can be made free of that Trade, I have
ſeen ſome; but they ſay they alter after, like a
Countrey Gentlemans Daughter, that ſets up
for a <hi>Town-Miſs,</hi> who preſently grows <hi>much
Finer, much Falſer,</hi> and <hi>leſs Sound.</hi> Yet to know
ſomething more of them, I read all the matter
of fact that is publiſh'd, never minding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
they give it, which generally is a
cheat, but by their Actions it ſeems to me that
they are a ſort of <hi>Engliſh Frenchmen,</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Papiſts,</hi> for all they Pretend is for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Religion, and the leſſening of <hi>France,</hi>
and all they Do is for the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi>
and the <hi>French</hi> power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>Oh plague, now I ſee the reaſon
why they advis'd the diſſolving of this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
who reſolved to diſcover their tricks to
the whole Nation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>I'd have theſe Fellows go like the
Serjeants men, dreſt <hi>party-per-pale,</hi> the right
ſide after the <hi>French Mode,</hi> the left after the
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> with a Book in their hands, the one
leaf of the Maſs, the other of the Common-Prayer:
and then my Lord Chief Juſtice ſhould
order <hi>Ketch</hi> to hang up the right ſides of them,
as high as <hi>Haman;</hi> and let their left ſides get
down as well as they could, and this is my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monſieur.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>Since they preſerve the Proteſtant
Religion, by bringing in <hi>Popery,</hi> maintain our
Liberties by making us Slaves; Secure <hi>England</hi>
by Betraying it to <hi>France;</hi> to be even with
them in their own Coyn, I would uſe them
as the <hi>Spiritual-Courts</hi> do thoſe that offend
them, deliver them to the <hi>Devil</hi> for the
Salvation of their Souls.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Peace, peace, man, they fear no <hi>Devil</hi>
but an <hi>Executioner,</hi> nor no day of Judgment
but the meeting of a <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>Why there is to be a new <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to ſit preſently at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but who ſhall
we Chuſe now Neighbour? You for the City,
and I for the Countrey.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, who ſhould we Chuſe man,
but ſuch as have in theſe laſt <hi>Parliaments,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
themſelves to be ſtrongly and heartily
againſt thoſe curſed twins, which our States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Brains are in labour to bring forth, <hi>Popery</hi>
and Arbitrary Power? and thoſe we will Chuſe
whether they themſelves will or no; for we
chuſe them more for our own good, then to
Complement them: and ſince they are not
born for themſelves but their Country, they
muſt be content to take the neceſſary trouble;
&amp; we muſt be careful to put them to none that
is unneceſſary; that is, let us Chuſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the expence of a peny, or the trouble of
a Journey, and if they will not then be at the
pains and charge of Attending in <hi>Parliament,</hi>
let <hi>Topham</hi> take them, as they, the Abhorrers
and all other Betrayers of our Liberties will
juſtly deſerve?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>But ſhall we Chuſe them before
they come to deſire it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger,</speaker>
               <p>Deſire it, you Simpleton! Prethee tell
me, If a pack of Rogues and Papiſts had
ſeized on thee, brought thee to the Gallows,
tied the Rope, and were juſt ready to turn thee
off the Ladder, and ſome honeſt Gentleman
coming in ſight ſhould fright the Rogues a
little off: If thou ſhouldſt then in a Sheepiſh
tone tell thoſe Gentlemen, If they wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to ſlip your neck out of the Nooſe,
and come down you wou'd do it, doſt not think
they wou'd have reaſon to Anſwer, They were
for the Liberty of the Subject, and wou'd preſs
nothing of that nature, but leave it to thy own
pleaſure, either to go along with them, or to
ſtay and let the Rogues make an end of their
work when they were gone?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>By the Maſs <hi>Hodge</hi> thou ſay'ſt well,
I have a woundy mind to do as thou ſay'ſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb facs="tcp:96385:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>But what, <hi>Tony?</hi> Is this a time to be
at Ifs, and Ands, and Buts?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> you know is a pretty
civil Gentleman, a fine bred man, aske our
Country Ladies elſe, treats us nobly both at
Table and Tavern, has a good eſtate, and needs
no Penſion, and may vote on our ſide, unleſs
now and then he give the Courtiers a vote in
a Civil way out of gratitude for the new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
and good breeding they teach him; or
help to ſave a Stateſmans Neck, that hugs him
and feaſts him all the <hi>Parliament</hi> time: though
he does not know him as ſoon as 'tis up. And
he ſwears <hi>dam him</hi> he is as much againſt <hi>Popery</hi>
as our Biſhops themſelves, and wou'd have all
men hang'd that are not as high for increaſing
the power of the Clergy as Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was.
Now this Courteous Gentleman has deſired
me of all Loves to vote for him but this once,
and ſays its unreaſonable to make the former
Members bear the burden or enjoy the honour
of it ſtill, and I vow methinks I can hardly
find in my heart to deny him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Find in your heart! Can you find in
your heart to be made worſe then a Gally Slave,
have Red-Coats come rifle your Pockets, raviſh
your Daughters, and burn your Houſes, &amp; then
let the Prieſts ſinge your Hides like Bacon in
<hi>Smithfield,</hi> for this you know you muſt expect
if your Members will be either brib'd, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or complemented out of their votes:
Will his good breeding help you to pay Taxes
when they come as thick as in the Penſioners
<hi>Parliament?</hi> Will his meat and drink ſtick with
you as long as <hi>Chimney-mony, Exciſe,</hi> and thoſe
other fettering Laws that ſuch civil Members
have made us? as for his Eſtate experience
ſhews that well bred-men can ſpend the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Eſtates, and quickly come to need a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but I ſay if he vote as a Penſioner, though
he be not ſo great a Knave, yet there's more
danger to us from ſuch fools; for theſe will
give us up for fair words, which is a Coyn never
wanting at Court, but thoſe will ſell us as dear
as they can, and prolong the time to get the
more by it, as we found by the Penſioners <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
who whilſt they were thinking to make
the beſt of the bargain, God put it in His
Majeſty's heart to diſolve them, and now we
are freemen again, unleſs ſuch eaſy believers
as you will be ſo courteous as to enſlave us
again. For what he ſwears about <hi>Popery,</hi> are
mens words or actions more to be credited? he
he may ſwear ſo, and thoſe learned Gentlemen
preach ſo long enough e'er they perſwade me
that they ſtickle for a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor for the
preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and
ſtrive to make the Prerogative arbitrary, for
the Liberty of the People; fleſh and blood,
Neighbor, cannot endure ſuch impudent lying.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>Ay but my Landlord wou'd ha' me
do't, and he's an honeſt Gentleman, you know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>I think he is, and I am ſorry to ſee he has more
Eſtate and Priviledge to loſe, then Wit to know his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
But prethee tell me, if he ſhould invite thee to Dinner,
take thee by the hand, and tell thee thou muſt needs do him
one curteſie, that is, Surrender thy Leaſe <hi>gratis</hi> to him, which
thou payd'ſt his Father <hi>500l.</hi> for, would'ſt thou not do it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>No by my Faith would I not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why then wilt thou give up thy Liberty, thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and all the reſt of thy Eſtate to his diſpoſe? Pay him his
Rent well, and all Reſpect imaginable; ſend him a Preſent
at a good time, if he uſe to invite thee; lend him thy Teams
for his Carriages now and then, or any other common Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
but in caſes of Religion, Life, Liberty and Property, no
Complements. I beſeech thee, <hi>Numps.</hi>

               <p>Well but our Parſon ſays I am bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to vote for thoſe that are for Abſolute Obedience
to Prince and Prelate, cites Texts of Scripture for it, ſays
all are Rebbels that do otherwiſe; and that 'tis a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sin to Vote for theſe that were againſt perſecuting
Diſſenters, or that enquir'd into the Grievances of the
Biſhops Courts. And what canſt thou ſay to that, <hi>Hodge?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Faith I ſhall ſay of him as I did e'en now of his
Superiours, I ſhall truſt my own Senſes more then what they
all ſay: Believe him in the Pulpit, when he preaches of
Faith and a good Life, joyn with him in the Publick
Prayers, pay him his Tythes, and receive the Sacrament
of him like a good Chriſtian; But when they undertake
the <hi>Politicks,</hi> either in the Pulpit or out of it, to perſwade
me to part with my Birthright, 'cauſe 'tis profound Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and to ſubmit to Popery, becauſe 'tis the Providence
of God; and to ſuffer the Cheats and Oppreſſions of the
Biſhops Courts, becauſe they have Gods Authority; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
much blame them, for all men are apt to follow their own
Intereſt; and this is theirs: But I muſt deſire to be excuſed,
for as good Reaſons as they preſs me to it: For if Arbitrary
Power will Raiſe the Clergy, by conſequence it will Depreſs
the Layety; If Popery will add to their Benefices Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Money,
Indulgence-Money, Purgatory-Money, and a
hundred other Perquiſites, beſides all the Abbey-Lands,
and take nothing from them but their Wives; I am ſure it
muſt take juſt ſo much from our Pockets, and add ſo much
more of their kind Bleſſings upon our Wives: And if our
Spiritual Courts muſt be more burdenſome, they may very
well ſupply the place of a Purgatory, and torment us ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
without it. I do not ſpeak this to reflect on our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
which I think as good as any other, but to ſhew they are
not ſo proper Judges in theſe Caſes: If the Law were to be
Regulated, would you refer it to Lawyers in general? If the
Phyſicians Fees, would you conſult the Colledge? If the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſions
of the Spiritual Court, would you truſt the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?
And for the ſame reaſon, will you rely on theſe men as
to Arbitrary Power, who have neither Dignity nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick,
but from the Court? Or as to the danger of a
a new Religion, by which they are to have twice as much
Power and Wealth as before? And to do them right, whilſt
the Pope gave the Preferments they were generally for the
Liberty of the People, and keeping the Prerogative iu its due
Limits; but all's now in the Crown, the Reaſon is alter'd,
and their Practce with it.</p>

               <speaker>Humph.</speaker>
               <p>I vow, <hi>Hodge,</hi> I ne'er underſtood till now why
they <hi>Talk'd ſo Much</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Acted ſo Little,</hi>
why they hate <hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> that would <hi>leſſen</hi> their Power,
more then <hi>Popery,</hi> that would <hi>enlarge</hi> it; and why they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> not onely by <hi>Diſallowing</hi> the <hi>Foreign
Churches,</hi> but by <hi>Diſowning</hi> the major part of thoſe at <hi>Home,</hi>
all that do not, like Fools, eſpouſe the Power of the Clergy
more then the Articles of their Creed. But what ſhall we
do with thoſe Old Members that voted as the <hi>Stateſmen</hi>
would have them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Turn them off, and get others in their Places that
we know to be of good Principles for the Freedom of an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman;</hi>
but do not believe too eaſily: Remember one bad
Choice may inſlave you for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one bad Vote turn the
Scales, when the queſtion is, <hi>Whether we ſhall be Freemen or
Bondmen.</hi> But talk no more of it, all hands to work, and
about your buſineſs, your All is at ſtake; inform thoſe you
find ignorant how their caſe ſtands; and I hope we may have
as good a <hi>Parliament</hi> as the laſt, and then the <hi>Stateſmen</hi> will
deſpair of playing any more tricks, and we and our Children
may be happy.</p>

as thou bid'ſt me, and about it preſently. <hi>Farewel.</hi>
