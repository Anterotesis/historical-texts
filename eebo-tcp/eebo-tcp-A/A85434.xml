         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>A Preface.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two Perſons whom <hi>Faith</hi>
hath to deal withall in ſeeking of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe,
and laying hold of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God the Father, and God the Son;
the holy Ghoſt being that Perſon that
ſets the heart a work to ſeek out for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and reveales the love of them both. And
therefore it is, that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> (which are the
object of Faiths inqueſt) are ſtill wiſht from <hi>God the
Father, and God the Son;</hi> ſo generally in all Epiſtles,
excepting that of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> given immediately
by word of mouth from Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And accordingly when Faith comes to treat with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171544:3"/>
theſe two about the great buſineſſe of Salvation, the
firſt and maine thing that it is inquiſitive after, is,
What their heart and mind is, and how they ſtand
enclined towards the receiving and pardoning of
ſinners: it liſtens moſt to heare ſomething of that: and
when a mans heart, through faith is fully &amp; throughly
perſwaded of it, then he is fully won.</p>
               <p>Hence, becauſe the Scriptures were written for our
comfort, and ſo, fitted to, and for the workings of
faith; therefore they were ſo written, as eſpecially
to bring down and lay before us the Heart of God
and of Chriſt: and ſo the maine thing they hold
forth, is, the full intent and purpoſe both of God and
of Chriſt to pardon and receive ſinners: <hi>This is a
faithfull ſaying,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Paul</hi> with open mouth) <hi>that
Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners;</hi> and this
Chriſt himſelf every where indigitates; and to hold
forth this, is the ſcope of theſe words uttered by
Chriſt himſelf. And ſuch ſpeeches do containe the
very heart, marrow, and pith of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And though the heart of a ſinner will never be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfied, till a perſwaſion be wrought, that God
and Chriſt are purpoſed and willing to ſave a mans
own ſelf in particular, (which perſwaſion is that
which we call <hi>Aſſurance</hi>) yet when once there is a
through perſwaſion ſetled upon the heart, but of ſo
much indefinitely and in generall; that God and
Chriſt are willing and fully reſolved to ſave <hi>ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
(ſo that the heart does truly beleeve that God is
in earneſt) this draws on the heart to come to Chriſt,
and is enough to work <hi>faith of adherence,</hi> ſuch, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Chriſt <hi>will never caſt us out</hi> (as the Text
hath it.)</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:171544:3"/>
               <p>The great buſineſſe then for the working faith in
men, is to perſwade them of Gods good will and
gracious inclination unto ſinners, to beget in them
good opinions of God and Chriſt this way; Men
naturally having hard and ſuſpitious thoughts of
both, as that ſpeech of Chriſt <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 17. implies, [<hi>God
ſent not His Son into the world to condemne the world, but
that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi>] Chriſt
would never have hinted ſuch a jealouſie, nor ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
ſuch thoughts to mens minds, had they not been
in them before, and this, to prevent and take off ſuch
jealouſies. Men are apt to think, that God had a
deſigne upon them as upon enemies, and laid but an
Ambuſhment for their further condemnation, in his
treaty of peace tendred to them by his Son. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of which we have in <hi>Luther,</hi> who fell into ſuch
ſuſpitions as theſe, for he miſunderſtanding ſome
words he met with in the Epiſtle to the Romans, as
they were rendred by the vulgar tranſlation then in
uſe, namely, theſe, that <hi>God ſent his Son to declare his
righteouſneſſe</hi> (as they are by us tranſlated) he thought
the meaning of them to have been this, <hi>to declare and
ſet forth his judgement</hi> on the world, (ſo he interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
[<hi>adjuſtitiam ſuam. &amp;c.</hi>]) The truth is, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
of mens thoughts herein were thoſe that have
put God to his Oath, [<hi>As I live, I will not the death of
a ſinner, &amp;c.</hi>] ſo alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. Men do not ſo uſually
queſtion the power of God, he is able enough to ſave
them they think; he is <hi>able to engraft them in</hi> (as the
Apoſtle ſpeakes to the Jewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 23.) but all
their doubts are about his <hi>Will. Gods will</hi> was the
Fountaine and ſpring of our ſalvation, in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171544:4"/>
of which he wrought <hi>all things according to the
counſel of his own will,</hi> (as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>
ſpeaketh) and in another place it is ſaid, <hi>He will have
mercy on whom he will, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore the great
queries in our hearts are concerning the will of God
towards us.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The words of the Text opened.</head>
               <p>NOw theſe words of my Text do hold forth the
full willingneſſe of both theſe two perſons, both
of God and of Chriſt:</p>
               <p>1. Of Chriſt, he here profeſſeth himſelf willing to
entertain all that will come to him, [<hi>He that will come
to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>] Which words are not
to be underſtood, as if ſpoken only of caſting out them
that are already come unto him, as if they were only
a promiſe againſt being caſt off after being received;
and ſo intended againſt feares of falling away: but
they are chiefly intended as an invitement to all that
are not yet come, that they would <hi>come to him,</hi> and
ſo, to expreſſe how ready and willing he is to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all commers, as one who ſets his doores open,
keeps open houſe, and beats back none that would
come in, [<hi>Him that commeth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt
out.</hi>] And though it may ſeem to be but a ſlender and
ſparing expreſſion of his readines to entertain ſuch, to
ſay only [<hi>I will not caſt them out,</hi>] yet though he
ſpeaks with the leaſt, yet he will do with the moſt, he
being <hi>abundant in goodneſſe and truth,</hi> and one that is
better then his word in the performance. As when he
ſayes, <hi>he will not deſpiſe a broken heart,</hi> is that all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171544:4"/>
eſteem he will manifeſt to ſuch a heart? Oh no, it is
the moſt welcome thing, and endeared frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that can be in any creature. His meaning is to ſhew
what he elſewhere ſayes of a meek ſpirit (which is all
one with a <hi>broken heart</hi>) that, <hi>with God</hi> it is <hi>of great
price,</hi> for ſo in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>I that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
eternity, with whom will I dwell? with a ſpirit that is
broken and contrite.</hi> He uſeth alſo this expreſſion of
<hi>not caſting them out,</hi> in relation, and for a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
anſwer unto the feare which he knew uſually
poſſeſſeth the hearts of poor ſinners when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to come to him; they fear he may reject them,
they know not their entertainment, their welcome.
To meet with this Scruple, he ſayes, [<hi>I will not caſt
ſuch out</hi>] chooſing rather thus to remove the doubt
that is in their hearts, then to expreſſe the fulneſſe of
his own: the Scriptures ſpeaking <hi>potius ad cor noſtrum
quam cor ſuum,</hi> rather <hi>unto</hi> our hearts, then fully what
is in his own, (which can never be done.)</p>
               <p>And yet even in this diminutive expreſsion, there
is that inſerted, which argues not only a willingneſſe
and readineſſe, but a reſolvedneſſe joyned with the
greateſt care and faithfulneſſe that can be, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>I
will [in no wiſe] caſt out.</hi> We may ſee his heart through
this little crevis: he doth herein as a faithfull man,
who to give the more full aſſurance puts in ſome
binding word into his promiſe, as [<hi>I will at no hand,
or in no wiſe faile you.</hi>] Thus does God alſo in that
known Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. (to the hornes of which
ſanctuary many a ſoule hath fled for refuge) <hi>I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> where there are no leſſe
then five negatives to bind and aſſure it, <hi>I will not, in
no wiſe, (&amp;c.) leave thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:171544:5"/>
               <p>Now this willingneſſe of his, on his part, Chriſt
ſhewes by two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, by that great journey he took, from heaven to
earth, and that to no other purpoſe but to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
For this (ſayes he) <hi>did I come down from heaven.</hi>
Great actions of one who is wiſe, muſt anſwerably
have great ends; now this was the greateſt thing that
ever was done, that the Son of God ſhould come
from Heaven. And when there can be but one end
of an action ſo great; that end muſt needs be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
or elſe the action is wholly in vain. Now in
comming down from heaven, he could have no other
end but the ſaving of ſinners, he could have no other
buſineſſe to do, that he did here; therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
put his comming into the world wholly upon
this, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, and do
attribute his taking upon him the <hi>likeneſſe of ſinfull
fleſh</hi> to have been [<hi>for ſin</hi>] ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. though other
ends might be ſuppoſed, and were accompliſht by
the aſſuming mans nature, yet he had no other end of
taking <hi>fraile fleſh,</hi> eſpecially there could be no other
end of his dying, but meerely and only for ſin: <hi>Iohn</hi>
12. 24. he ſayes, <hi>If he had not fallen to the ground and
dyed,</hi> he had then remained <hi>in Heaven alone,</hi> and no
ſinners had come thither: that therefore they might
aſcend to heaven, he deſcends from heaven, <hi>I came
down from heaven, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He demonſtrates his willingneſſe by this,
that his Father had ſent him on purpoſe to receive
and to ſave ſinners: <hi>I come</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>to do the will of
him who ſent mee:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. he ſayes [<hi>I came not of
my ſelf, but (my Father) he ſent me</hi>] And if he were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171544:5"/>
ſent by his Father to this end (as he affirmes he was,
and as by the coherence appeares, for he makes it the
reaſon why he will caſt none out) then certainly he
will faithfully do the work he was ſent for: In <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.
1. he is called the <hi>Apoſtle of our profeſsion [Apoſtle</hi>]
that is, <hi>one ſent,</hi> ſo the word ſignifies; and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes?
<hi>who was [faithfull</hi> to him that appointed him.
Now upon theſe conſiderations, Chriſt tells you that
you may build upon him, that you ſhall certainly find
him willing.</p>
               <p>2. For his Fathers willingneſſe, he tels us we may
be much more confident of it: for he puts his own
willingneſſe and all upon that: <hi>Him</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that
the Father gives me, ſhall come to me; and him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. For I came down
from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him
that ſent me: and this is the Fathers will that hath ſent
me, &amp;c.</hi> In which words you may obſerve both
<hi>wherein</hi> he declares his Father to be engaged, and
<hi>how much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Wherein:</hi> and that by two things:</p>
               <p>1. That he ſent him to that end, and ſo, it is his
Fathers buſineſſe more then his own. So alſo <hi>Luke</hi>
2. 49. he expreſſeth himſelf: [<hi>Shall I not do my Fathers
buſineſſe?</hi>] as elſewhere in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he is called his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Servant</hi> in it, and <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 36. he makes it his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that he in a ſolemne manner gave unto
him them whom he would have to be ſaved, with
charge to loſe none [<hi>All that the Father hath given me
ſhall come unto me:</hi>] and this is his will, that I ſhould
loſe none, but give him an account of every ſoul of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171544:6"/>
them at the laſt day. They are given him as jewels,
and as his <hi>Beniamins,</hi> to look to, and ſee to bring back
and keep from deſtruction. Now whom he ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
gave to Chriſt to ſave, he will never caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
when they ſhall come unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Then 2. he ſhewes <hi>how much,</hi> and how <hi>deeply,</hi> his
Father is engaged, and makes it his Fathers will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then his own: [<hi>I come not to do my own will, but
the will of him that ſent me:</hi>] The meaning whereof
is, not to ſhew that he came unwillingly, or receives
ſinners unwillingly, but that his Fathers will was
firſt in it (as I ſhall ſhew anon,) and ſo much in it, that
(if you will reſolve it into its firſt principles Chriſts
comming was principally to pleaſe his Father. It is
ſuch a ſpeech, as that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 22. [<hi>The Father judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no man: but hath committed all judgement to the Son,
&amp;c.</hi>] Not that God is not a <hi>Iudge</hi> as well as Chriſt,
(for <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. he is termed the <hi>Iudge of all men</hi>) but
becauſe all judgement is viſibly committed unto
Chriſt, therefore the Father is ſaid to <hi>judge no man.</hi>
So here, becauſe the Fathers will is chiefe, and firſt
in it, Chriſt therefore ſayes, he came not to do his
own will, but the will of him that ſent him.</p>
               <p>And ſo you have the meaning of the words.</p>

               <p>THE Obſervation, which I ſingle out of theſe

               <p>Both <hi>God the Father,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt the Son</hi> are fully
willing, and reſolved to ſave ſinners.</p>
               <p>1. For <hi>God the Father,</hi> There are many Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his will herein, that may be taken <hi>ab extra</hi>
from his Oath, Word, Promiſe, &amp;c. which I ſhall
handle in another method: but thoſe which I ſhall
firſt hold forth, are more intimate and <hi>Intrinſecall,</hi> and
homogeneall to the argument which Chriſt uſeth
here in the Text, which we have ſeen) to be theſe,
that it was Gods will firſt, and Chriſts, but becauſe
it was his, (<hi>I come not to do mine own will,</hi>) and that it
was he that dealt with Chriſt about it, and wrought
him off to it, and made it his buſineſſe; (<hi>but the will of
him that ſent me.</hi>) So that the Demonſtrations which
I ſhall pitch upon, ſhall be drawn from Gods engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both from his tranſactions with Chriſt from
everlaſting, before he came into the world, and thoſe
that now lie upon him from Chriſts having fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
what he ſent him into the world for. And
from either may be fetcht ſtrong conſolations, and
confirmations to our faith, that Gods will muſt needs
continue moſt ſerious and hearty to ſave ſinners.</p>
               <p>Many other ſorts of Demonſtrations of this point
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:171544:7"/>
might be fetcht and drawn from the riches of his

&amp; on what greater purchaſe could they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
to ſhew forth the glory thereof, then upon the

the preſent let lie by untold, having elſewere counted
them up, and ſet them forth, ſuch demonſtrations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only proper to this Text, as argue an engagement
of his will; whereas all thoſe riches of mercie that
are in him (although the moving cauſe of all) might
have for ever remained in him as his nature, without
any determination of his will to ſave any man. When
therefore a poor ſinner ſhall heare (beſides the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diſpoſition of Gods nature) that acts and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his will have paſt from him, about the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
of ſinners, ſo as his will hath engaged all the
mercies of his nature to effect it, this brings in ſtrong
conſolation.</p>
               <p>Now the deepneſſe of theſe engagements of his wil
to pardon ſinners, may be demonſtrated,</p>
               <p>1. From ſuch tranſactions of his, as were held by
him with Chriſt from everlaſting; which hath both
put ſtrong obligations upon him, and alſo argue him
fully and firmly reſolved to ſave ſinners. Now all
the particular paſſages of thoſe treaties of his with
Chriſt, about the reconciliation of ſinners from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
I have elſewhere alſo at large handled; and
therefore it is not my ſcope now to enumerate them.
I ſhall now onely draw Demonſtrations from ſome
few of them, by way of <hi>Corollary,</hi> to help our faith in
this point in hand, namely, Gods reſolvedneſſe to
pardon ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:171544:7"/>
The firſt is drawn from this, That God the Father
had the firſt and chiefe hand in this matter of ſaving
ſinners (as I then ſhewed) the project was his, and
the firſt motion his.</p>
               <p>1. The Project, he laid the plot of it, and contrived
all about it, for the effecting of it. Therefore <hi>John</hi>
5. 19. Chriſt ſayes <hi>the Son can do nothing of himſelf, but
what he ſees the Father do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The firſt <hi>Motion</hi> was his, <hi>I came not to do my own
will,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>but the will of him that ſent him.</hi>
Both which (<hi>Project</hi> and firſt <hi>motion</hi>) are ſhut up in
that one ſentence, <hi>Epheſ. 1. He worketh all things by the
[counſaile] of his own [will.]</hi> Now, for God thus to
have the firſt hand in it, did put a great and deep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
upon his Will in it. We ſee among men,
the Projector and firſt motioner of a buſineſſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
moſt forward in it; becauſe then it is moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
his own; and the greater will be his honour
in the compaſſing of it. How many great affaires have
been ſpoiled, becauſe ſome men have not been the
chiefe and firſt in them that affect the preheminence?
Now this honour God the Father may challenge,
that he was the firſt in reconciling and ſaving ſinners:
It is therefore called <hi>Gods wiſdome, Eph.</hi> 3. 10. and <hi>his
purpoſe, Epheſ. 1. 9. Gods righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and
<hi>the pleaſure of the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Project and Motion did riſe up in
him unto a ſtrong reſolution and purpoſe, and to an
unalterable decree to ſave ſinners by Chriſt: ſo
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>And 1. For his purpoſes, they are immutable.
Would not <hi>Paul</hi> lightly alter purpoſes taken up by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171544:8"/>
him, <hi>When I therefore was thus tamed</hi> (ſayes he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1, 17.) <hi>did I uſe lightneſſe? or the things that I purpoſe
do I purpoſe according to the Fleſh, that with me there
ſhould be yea, yea, and nay, nay?</hi> Would not <hi>Paul</hi> (I ſay)
alter his purpoſe becauſe he preached the Goſpel, and
will God (think you) alter them who gave the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
no, it is the <hi>ete nall Goſpel, Revel</hi> 14. 6. and God
is of the ſame minde ſtill, ſo it follows in that place
to the <hi>Corinths, But as God is true</hi> (or varies not) <hi>ſo was
our word to you,</hi> which yet is his more then <hi>Pauls,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. For Gods Decrees, (whereof this was one, they
are alſo <hi>immutable.</hi> The great Monarchs of the earth,
the Perſians, took to themſelves the infallibility, that
they would not alter the Decrees which they made:
(therefore when a thing was unalterable, it was ſaid
to be <hi>as the Lawes of the Medes and Perſians</hi>) which was
to ſhew their greatneſſe, and their wiſdome, that they
could ſo reſolve, as no perſon or power whatſoever
ſhould be ſtrong enough to cauſe them to change
their reſolutions: and yet, they were forced, though
not to alter a former Decree, yet to give counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
unto it, (as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> did, and men do alter,
becauſe they cannot foreſee all events, and ſo cannot
make unalterable Decrees without prejudice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pope, who takes on him the ſtyle of <hi>Infallible,</hi>
and ſo aſſumes to himſelf the higheſt prerogative that

                     </gap>gat
ſibi manus,</hi> that he never binds his own hands by any
Decree he makes, becauſe he cannot fore ſee all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
notwithſtanding what ever he aſſumes:
But with God it is not thus, <hi>He is not a man that he
ſhould</hi> have cauſe to <hi>repent,</hi> for he knows and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
all that can or will follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:171544:8"/>
Now 1. this immutability of his counſaile he ſhews
by two oaths; the firſt made to Chriſt, the ſecond
to us.</p>
               <p>1. To Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 7. 21. This Prieſt</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>was made
with an oath, by him that ſaid unto him, The Lord ſware
and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever, &amp;c.</hi> And
this was from everlaſting; for then it was that Chriſt
was firſt made Prieſt: Now then God foreſaw that
he could never have a relenting thought at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
of ſinners through him, this his Son would ſo
ſatisfie and pleaſe him: and thereupon he ſware.</p>
               <p>2. To us, <hi>Heb. 6. 17, 18. God willing more abundantly
to ſhew unto the heires of promiſe the immutability of his
counſaile, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable
things (in which it was impoſsible for God to lie) we might
have a ſtrong conſolation, &amp;c.</hi> The thing I alledge this
place for, and which I would have obſerved, is, that
this oath is not mentioned as that now which makes
God ſo immutable, (though that be a truth) But Gods
oath is here made that whereby God did declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us the immutability of his purpoſe formerly and
from everlaſting taken up, and ſo that immutability
of his counſaile was the cauſe of his oath, and that
was to pardon ſinners: for it is the Promiſe made to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, that is there ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Yea 3. God ſet his ſeale unto all, further to confirm
it. He both <hi>ſealed Chriſt to the work,</hi> Joh. 6. 27. and
likewiſe ſealed up in his Decrees the perſons of thoſe
ſinners that ſhall be ſaved. 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lord remains ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord
knoweth who are his.</hi> And if it were but a Kings ſeal,
it could not be reverſed, but this is Gods. Yea, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171544:9"/>
hath <hi>ſealed up their ſins</hi> alſo by and through Chriſt,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. never to be remembred or lookt upon
more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God reſted not in a Decree only, but
entred into Covenant with Chriſt to ſave ſinners
by him, if he would die. This Covenant you
have Dialogue-wiſe ſet out, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49. Friſt,
Chriſt begins at the firſt and ſecond verſes, and
ſhewes his Commiſſion, telling God how he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, and fitted him for the work of Redemption,
and he would know what <hi>reward</hi> he ſhould receive of
him for ſo great an undertaking: God anſwers him,
<hi>ver.</hi> 3. and at firſt offers low, only the Elect of Iſrael.
Chriſt who ſtood now a making his bargain with
him, thought theſe too few, and not worth ſo great a
labour and work, becauſe few of the Jewes would
come in, but would refuſe him, therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 4. he
ſayes, <hi>he ſhould labour in vain,</hi> if this were all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence:
and yet withall he tels God, that ſeeing
his heart was ſo much in ſaving ſinners to ſatisfie him,
he would do it however for thoſe few, comforting
himſelfe with this, that his <hi>work was with the Lord.</hi>
Upon this God comes off more freely, and openeth
his heart more largely to him, as meaning more amply
to content him for his paines in dying: <hi>It is a light
thing</hi> (ſayes God to him) <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob,</hi> that is not worth the
dying for, <hi>I</hi> value thy ſufferings more then ſo, <hi>I will
give thee for a ſalvation unto the ends of the earth.</hi> Upon
this he made a promiſe to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is more then a purpoſe. A purpoſe may be in
ones ſelfe, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 9. but a promiſe is made to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:171544:9"/>
Now God cannot lie in himſelfe, but moſt of
all, not to his Son.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A ſecond ſort of Demonſtrations. The engagements of
Gods heart to ſinners, from, and upon Chriſts having
dyed at his requeſt.</head>
               <p>A Second ſort of Demonſtrations are drawn from
Chriſts having already come and performed all
this: for</p>
               <p>1. Chriſt is now to be ſatisfied for that his dying,
as well as he by his death had ſatisfied God: he is
now to have his reward. God never ſet any on work,
but he gave them wages. Thus unto <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
he gave <hi>Egypt</hi> as his hire for his ſervice at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and
to <hi>Cyrus</hi> he gave hidden treaſure. Now it is not
Chriſts own glory that will ſatisfie him, for that he
could have had, and never have dyed: there remains
therefore nothing that can or will ſatisfie him, but to
have the end of his death, <hi>To ſee his ſeed and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and to ſee of the travaile of his ſoule:</hi> and <hi>to juſtifie
many,</hi> as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. He dyed (as himſelfe ſpeaks, <hi>Iohn</hi>
12. 24.) that he might not be alone in heaven: his
deſire is, that thoſe whom he dyed for might ſee his
glory.</p>
               <p>2. If we conſider the act it ſelf, of delivering Chriſt
unto death, there was not, nor could there ever be
any thing more abhorrent unto God; no act ever
went ſo much againſt his heart: for if he be <hi>afflicted
in all our afflictions,</hi> and doth not <hi>willingly puniſh the
ſonnes of men,</hi> neither <hi>wils the death of a ſinner</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171544:10"/>
it, much leſſe would he will the death of his
own Son. Now what was there to ſweeten the death
and ſufferings of his Son unto him, except his end in
it? (for it is the end that ſweetens and facilitates the
meanes tending unto it) Now the end of Chriſts
death could be no other but to take ſinnes away, and
to procure the pardon of ſinners, and ſo it muſt needs
be infinitely delightfull unto him, and his heart
ſtrongly ſet upon it, ſeeing it did ſweeten unto him an
act otherwiſe ſo abhorrent, and of this end therefore
it is impoſſible he ſhould ever repent. Now <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2.
the very offering of Chriſt is called a <hi>Sacrifice of a
ſweet ſmelling ſavour:</hi> and what was it that made it ſo,
but even the end for which it was done, (and which
is there put upon it) that it was out of love unto us, and
out of a mind to have ſinners pardoned; for elſe in it
ſelfe it muſt needs have been abominable unto him.</p>
               <p>Agai 3. if at any time he would have repented him
of his purpoſe, it would have been at the time of
Chriſts being crucified, when he came to <hi>bruiſe him:</hi>
then his heart would have recoyled, and eſpecially
when Chriſt poured out his ſoule with ſuch ſtrong
cries and teares as he did. At other times in puniſhing
but his children, we find, that when he comes to do
it, his heart as it were fails him, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. [<hi>How ſhall
I give thee up?</hi>] the rod falls out of his hand, and his
bowels yearn within him; yet he relented not when
he ſaw the ſoule of his <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in bitterneſſe, but ſtill
made an impoſſibility of it for him to avoid ſuffering,
becauſe his purpoſe was thereby to take ſinnes away.
Therefore Chriſts requeſt was, <hi>Father, if it be poſsible,
let this cup paſſe:</hi> The neceſsity lay only in Gods will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:171544:10"/>
in reference to his end, to forgive ſinnes. If God
would ever have relented or repented him of this
purpoſe, it would have been then: we read of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
him of other of his works, but his mind is ſo
fully carried to take away ſins, that he did not then, or
can ever repent of putting his own Son to death, for
the effecting of it: To pardon ſinners is more naturall
to him, then to kill his Son was unnaturall. Now his
end and purpoſe being thus fully ſet to pardon and
ſave ſinners, if he ſhould be fruſtrated of this his end,
he would then indeed repent him of uſing his Son as
he had done. Nay, it is not only ſaid, that he repented
not, but that <hi>it pleaſed him to bruiſe Chriſt,</hi> in reſpect
to that his end, which was ſo pleaſant to him: So you
have it <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. And therefore ſurely it pleaſeth
him much more, to pardon ſinners, now he hath thus
bruiſed him: and ſo indeed it followes there, <hi>The
pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> It is ſpoken
of his ſaving and juſtifying of ſinners. It troubled
God to heare a ſoul <hi>bemoan</hi> it ſelf for its ſin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 20.
but we read not that it did ſo, when Chriſt bemoaned
himſelf in his ſufferings; and the reaſon was, becauſe
the work that Chriſt was about to do, was a ſweet
Sacrifice to him; and it would trouble God more to
condemn a ſinner that Chriſt dyed for, then it did to
ſacrifice Chriſt for him.</p>
               <p>4. Upon that ancient agreement between God and
Chriſt: God pardoned millions of men under the Old
Teſtament upon the bare word of Chriſt, before he
came into the world, or had paid one peny of the debt
he muſt needs therfore be ſuppoſed to be much more
willing now to do it, when Chriſt has done all that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:171544:11"/>
was required, and failed not, and that at <hi>the due time,</hi>
(as it is ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.) If Chriſt had failed or come ſhort
but of a little of what he was to do, God might have
denyed to let the world go upon truſt any longer: But
now Jeſus Chriſt hath performed all, and is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with him, and hath put in ſtock enough to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
ſinners to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Yet 5. Now even Juſtice it ſelf will call upon him
to diſcharge ſinners, it will not let him reſt in quiet
till he has pardoned and ſhewed mercy unto poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that come to Chriſt, and hath given in their
bond, and this, though we had no promiſe to ſhew for
it, yea, though Chriſt himſelf had nothing to ſhew
for it: Gods very juſtice would <hi>trouble him</hi> (I may ſo
ſpeak with reverence, for he himſelf ſayes, that he
was <hi>troubled for Ephraim, Ier.</hi> 29.) till he had given out
an acquitance, becauſe he knows the debt is paid, and
alſo, that Chriſts and his own intent was, that when
Chriſt had once dyed, ſinners ſhould thereby be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified:
Even as if an honeſt man had a bond for a
debt that is diſcharged, lying ſtill in his hands, of
which payment, he whoſe debt it is, knowes nothing,
although he or they that paid this debt were dead,
ſo that there were no one left that were able to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
an acquaintance from him, and a cancelling of that
bond; yet meer honeſty would cauſe him to give it
in. Now Jeſus Chriſt dyed, and God himſelfe put
him to death meerly to pay our debts, and ſays Chriſt
at his death; <q>Let ſinners require my blood, and the
merits of it at thy hands, and have out in pardon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That was Chriſts will which he made at his death,
(as you have it <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. where the Apoſtle calls
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171544:11"/>
it <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. where the Apoſtle calls it a <hi>Teſtament
confirmed by the death of the Teſtator</hi>) now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo ſacred as the performance of the will of the
dead. And now Chriſt himſelf is alive again, and is
ordained by God to be his own Executor, and ſo lives
to claime an acquitance; therefore certainly God
will never withhold it: In juſtice he cannot, he will
not, have a bond lie by him that is diſcharged. Hence
it is ſaid, that <hi>God is juſt to forgive our ſinnes, 1 Iohn</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>There are three things which do cry for Juſtice,
and all do meete in this.</p>
               <p>1. The wages of a hireling (if detained) are ſaid to
cry. So in the 5. of <hi>Iames</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The wages of Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>
detained, <hi>do crie in the eares of the Lord of Hoſts:</hi>
They cry wages being due in juſtice, and becauſe
Gods Juſtice is thereby provoked, and cannot be quiet
till God hath avenged it. And ſo would Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
having been made for us; It would reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cry to God, and not ſuffer his Juſtice to be quiet,
unles we were pardoned. For he was truly and indeed
Gods hired <hi>Servant</hi> in this work: And God covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to give him the ſalvation of thoſe he dyed for as
his wages and reward, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> often repreſents it,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 53. and elſewhere. So that if God be juſt, he
muſt give forth ſalvation; otherwiſe Chriſts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
would cry as the work of an hireling doth for
wages.</p>
               <p>A Second thing that cries for juſtice, is the will of
one that is dead unperformed, who hath bequeathed
legacies, &amp; left wherewith to pay and diſcharge them.
And this is yet a louder cry then the former. Now
Chriſt before he dyed, did thus make his will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:171544:12"/>
pardon of ſin and juſtification, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
inheritance in heaven, as legacies to thoſe for
whom he dyed, and to be given out by God after his
death, as I obſerved even now out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17.
where it is ſaid that Chriſt was <hi>The Mediator of the
New Teſtament, that by meanes of death they who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
might receive the promiſe</hi> (or bequeathed legacie)
<hi>of eternall life.</hi> And thereupon <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. the Apoſtle
calls this a <hi>Teſtament, confirmed by his death,</hi> and <hi>which
at his death began to be in force,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 17. And of all
things that in juſtice are held due, the performance of
the will of the dead, hath ever been held moſt
ſacred.</p>
               <p>There is yet a third thing which cries for juſtice,
and that is innocent blood ſpilt. And this cries low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then all the reſt. So <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 4. 10. And the Apoſtle
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. ſets forth the cry of Chriſts blood for us,
by <hi>Abels</hi> blood crying againſt <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be notwithſtanding this that God may put
the bond in ſuit againſt a ſinner to make him come to
acknowledge the debt, (as the Apoſtle there ſpeakes
[<hi>If we confeſſe our ſins</hi>]) But if any ſoul doth ſay, <hi>I have
ſinned and it profited me not;</hi> God then cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
from throwing down his bond canceld, ſaying,
<hi>Deliver him, I have found a ranſome, (Iob</hi> 33.) God will
not have innocent blood, ſuch as his Sons is, to ly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. If he ſhould not pardon ſinners, Chriſts
blood would be upon him, for it was for them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Chriſt dyed, being in himſelf innocent.</p>
               <p>6. God mends not himſelf by damning thoſe for
whom Chriſt dyed: Now there were not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
to Chriſt and us in it, but God himſelf alſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:171544:12"/>
would prove a loſer. For the end of Chriſts death
was not ſimply to ſatisfie juſtice, ſo as without it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
could not have permitted a pardon, that might
have been diſpenſed with, but it was chiefly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the glory of Gods juſtice, which required ſuch
a ſatisfaction, (as the Apoſtle ſayes <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.) <hi>To [de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare]
his righteouſneſſe for the remiſsion of ſins that are
paſt, through Gods forbearance.</hi> Is was we ſee the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
or declaration of the glory of his juſtice
that he aimed at in it. So as if any one mans ſin ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for by Chriſt, ſhould be left unforgiven, Gods
juſtice ſhould loſe ſo much glory. And if juſtice ſhould
think to get a greater glory out of the ſinners, that
could never be: for the ſinner is unable ever to ſatisfie,
and ſo to glorify Gods juſtice by ſuffering as Chriſt
hath done. Yea, and beſides, God would be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a greater loſer in the glory of his mercy alſo,
which by his pardoning ſinne is advanced.</p>

               <head>The ſecond part of the Obſervation. <hi>Demonſtrations

               <p>AND ſo now I come to <hi>Chriſts willingneſſe,</hi> which
was the ſecond thing propounded in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
to be demonſtrated. Now though his will
was not firſt in it, (as was ſaid) yet we ſhall finde him
to have been no leſſe willing then his Father. As
Chriſt in ſubſiſting is the ſecond perſon, and hath his
perſonall ſubſiſtence from his Father, ſo he is ſecond
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:171544:13"/>
alſo in order of working, and conſequently, of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
too, yet he is not ſecond to him in heartineſſe of
willing: but as his Father and he are equall, ſo in all
that his Father willeth, his will is equall with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſo, is as much in this buſines as his.</p>
               <p>In the demonſtrating of this, I will take the ſame
courſe that I did in the former:</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew how hearty he was in this, To
have ſinners ſaved before he came into the world.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, How willing he was ſince he came
into the world, and ſince his death and going out of
the world.</p>
               <p>And as a generall introduction to either, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
this, which ſhall be as the corner ſtone in this
building, joyning both parts of this diſcourſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and is a conſequent of what hath formerly been
delivered.</p>
               <p>The thing to be premiſed is this: That if God the
Father be willing, then Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs be
willing alſo, and look how much the will of the one
is in it, ſo much the will of the other muſt be in it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
for <hi>the Father and he are all one;</hi> And this will ſerve
for our further aſſurance of the wils of either; and
we may make uſe of it both wayes, either to argue
to our faith, that if the Father be willing, Chriſt muſt
needs be ſo alſo; and that if Chriſt be willing, the
Father is ſo alſo. That whereas ſome mens thoughts
have been more taken up about, and ſo more taken
with the conſideration of how much the Fathers
heart was in it, and how active and plotting he was
about it: and again, others mens apprehenſions have
been carried more unto Chriſts heart in the work:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:171544:13"/>
this Demonſtration which I have in hand ſhall be a help to the
faith of either of theſe; ſo that if your hearts have a <hi>door of Faith,</hi>
(as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>ſet open,</hi> or a window to ſee either into
Gods heart, or Chriſts, you may raiſe a confidence of the one
from the other, and ſo come to be ſure of both.</p>
               <p>And this alſo I do firſt mention, becauſe it is the moſt intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall
bottome-demonſtration that can be made of Chriſts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe,
and is the utmoſt reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>This demonſtration I found upon <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30. [<hi>I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are one</hi>] That whereas in this my Text he ſhewes how his
Fathers will and his agree in one, he there gives the reaſon of it,
for (ſayes he) <hi>we are one:</hi> and the words there, as they ſtand in
their coherence, are proper to the purpoſe in hand. For Chriſt
there alledgeth them, as the reaſon why his heart, and power, and
all in him is ſo engaged for the ſalvation of his own, that if he
have any power in him, and be able to do any thing, not <hi>one of
them ſhall periſh, becauſe his Father and he are one.</hi> For mark the
occaſion upon which he ſpeaks this, it is the ſame that here in my
Text. He had been ſpeaking of ſaving his ſheep, and of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and will to ſave them; and concludes, that <hi>they ſhall never
periſh.</hi> And he ſayes not only, that <hi>he will never caſt them out,</hi>
(as here) but that, <hi>neither ſhall any man pluck them out of his hand.</hi>
And in that ſpeech he ſhewes and utters the ſtrength of his will,
as much as of his power. For otherwiſe although his hand of
power had been never ſo potent to have held them, againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
yet if his will had not as ſtrongly reſolved to hold them
in his hand, and ſo, if they were not as deep in his heart as they
are faſt in his hands, this ſpeech of his had not been made good,
That <hi>they ſhall never periſh.</hi> And then he gives the reaſon both
of this reſoluteneſs of his will, and this prevalencie of his power,
from his Fathers both will and power, engaged as much as his
own, in this fulneſſe: <hi>My Father</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that gave them me
is greater then all, and none is able to pluck them cut of my Fathers
hands.</hi> He pleads here firſt his Fathers will, [<hi>He gave them me:</hi>]
And then ſecondly, his power, (whom theſe Jewes he ſpake to
acknowledged greater than all, though him they did not) <hi>He is
greater then all; none can pluck them out of his hands:</hi> and then
argues to himſelf, [<hi>My Father and I are one:</hi>] One in nature,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:171544:14"/>
therefore much more in will. Two perſons that have diſtinct
eſſence, may yet be one in will, as the Ten Kings are ſaid to be of
<hi>one minde</hi> when they agreed in one thing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 13, 17. ſo <hi>Act.</hi>
4. 32. it is ſaid, that they that believed were of <hi>one heart,</hi> and of
<hi>one ſoule,</hi> that is, in judgement and conſent of minde. But Chriſt
and God the Father <hi>are one</hi> yet neerer; one in nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
much more entire in will, for by nature they have but one
will between them. And that place ſpeaks at once in relation to
both their willingneſſe to ſave, as to both their powers to ſave
ſinners. And this is not only an Argument that they did both
agree, and were like to agree in it; but that they can never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree.
Two that eſſentially have two wills, though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
agreeing in one; yet it may be ſuppoſed that they may come
to diſagree, and not will the ſame thing: but if they eſſentially
have but one will, it is impoſſible then but that they muſt ever
agree. This great ſecurity therefore doth Chriſt give for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of ſinners. You have not only two Perſons engaged, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<hi>greater then all,</hi> but all that is in them engaged, both their
Power and Will; and what more can be deſired? And if the
one holds his purpoſe, the other muſt alſo; for they are one. You
have the one-neſſe of God and Chriſt given you for ſecurity; ſo
that if they can never be made two, and wrought aſunder, then
ſinners muſt needs be ſaved. Till theſe two Perſons do diſagree,
you are ſure enough; and they muſt ceaſe to be, ere they can ceaſe
to agree; for they are <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>one in being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have another teſtimony as full as this, 1 <hi>John 5. 7. There
are three that beare record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and
the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (we are yet ſurer here is a third Perſon that
comes in) <hi>and theſe three are one.</hi> Now what is the thing that
theſe do witneſſe unto? <hi>ver.</hi> 11. it followes, <hi>This is the record,
that God hath given to us eternall life, and this life is in his Sonne.</hi>
Here their truth is pawned, as in that other place their power
was: for the Apoſtle alledgeth this as ſuch a truth, as they all
agree and ſtand in to make good. And to prove this, he ſayes (as
in that other place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.) that <hi>theſe three are one:</hi> that is, <hi>one</hi>
in nature, therefore <hi>one</hi> in will; and ſo alſo <hi>one</hi> in witneſſe to this
truth. He ſayes not only, They agree in one; for you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that whereas there are three other witneſſes mentioned to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:171544:14"/>
be on earth, there is this difference put between their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie
in their teſtimonies and that of theſe, that <hi>they agree in one,</hi>
(ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 8.) but there is more ſaid of theſe, namely, that <hi>they are
one;</hi> that is, in Nature, and ſo in Will or Purpoſe; and ſo muſt
needs much more agree in one. Now that thing which their wils,
and teſtimonies, and all agree in, is (as hath been ſaid) that God
hath given us eternall life; and this life is in his Son, to all that
ſhall come for it. So that for Demonſtrations of this, I need go
no further. If there be any Power, Will, or Truth in theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Sinners ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, as the moſt bottome ground of Chriſts
being at firſt, and his continuing to be for ever willing to pardon
ſinners; let us more particularly ſee, firſt, how his heart ſtood to
the ſalvation of them before he came into the world: and then
ſecondly, how it ſtood enclined unto it after he was come; and
what confirmations our faith may have from both. So that the
thing that I am herein to ſpeak to, is not ſo much his willingnes
to the work of Redemption it ſelf, (that I have elſwhere handled
apart) but his willingneſſe and readineſſe to <hi>ſave ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Let us ſee how his heart ſtood to this <hi>before the world was,</hi>
and before he came into it. And for this we find, that his <hi>delights</hi>
were ſet upon it; ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. [<hi>Rejoycing in the habitable
parts of his earth; and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi>]
Which words are more properly ſpoken of Chriſt, then of God
the Father; and therefore I produce them under this Head. For
they are ſaid to be ſpoken by <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> that is, Chriſt himſelf, he
therein ſhewing how his minde ſtood towards us before the
world began: for he ſpeaks what he and his Father did <hi>before the
mountains were, &amp;c. I was ſet up from everlaſting, ver. 22. Then
I was by him, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 30. And how did they paſſe away that
long <hi>aevum?</hi> (as the Apoſtle cals it) in nothing but rejoycing and
delights. He there ſpeaks of nothing elſe that they did. And
what was the matter of delight unto them?</p>
               <p>1. He and his Father delighted one in another, <hi>ver.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>2. In the ſalvation of men, <hi>My delights were with the ſons of
men,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 31. And he ſpeaks of men as falne; for it is ſaid in
the beginning of the ſame verſe, that he <hi>rejoyced in the habitable
parts of his earth;</hi> which is ſpoken not of the Jews only, but of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171544:15"/>
the Gentiles too, and of men all the earth over. Now firſt, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi>
ariſe out of the ſtrongeſt and choiceſt deſires. Men are
pleaſed with many things in which they <hi>delight</hi> not. Chriſts
heart and deſires muſt needs have been moſt on that which his
delights are in. Again, ſecondly, the greater the perſons are, and
the greater their minds are, the greater are their delights. Things
of great concernment are uſually the objects which are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of Kings, and which they take pleaſure in. Now the great
God and Jeſus Chriſt ſingled out the pardon and reconciliation
of ſinners for their chiefe delights.</p>
               <p>3. Their delight herein is mentioned, and in no other work of
theirs: not the Angels, nor the World, nor any thing in it.</p>
               <p>4 This their delight is mentioned next to their delighting in
each other.</p>
               <p>And fiftly, this delight he took aforehand, whilſt his heart was
only in the expectation of it, and his mind but laying the plot of
it. He delights in it ere he doth it. And if all this joy of his be
only in the thoughts of it, how much more will it delight him
when he comes to do it? All this argues how great a matter
this was in his eſteem, and how much his heart was in it, and
that from everlaſting.</p>

               <head>Demonſtrations from the diſpoſition of Chriſts heart, and his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

               <p>IN the ſecond place, when Chriſt had aſſumed our nature, and
whilſt he remained upon earth, how did this diſpoſition of his
abound in him? It were endleſſe to give all the inſtances that his
ſtory and Sermons do afford hereof. See but how welcome all
ſorts of ſinners were at all times unto him: He caſt out none that
acknowledged him for the Meſſiah: he turned none away that
gave up their ſoules unto him to be ſaved his own way. He was
indeed moſt reſerved unto that rich young man of any other, yet
he uſed him courteouſly, the Text ſaith <hi>he loved him;</hi> Chriſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him not away, but directed him the right way to follow
him: And he went away of himſelf, undervaluing Chriſt to his
poſſeſſions. And another time Chriſt indeed ſeems to diſcourage
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:171544:15"/>
the Canaanitiſh woman, and put her away, calling her dog: But
it was only in words; for underhand he ſtrongly drawes her
heart to him by his Spirit, and ſuggeſts thereby to her heart by
way of anſwer, a conſideration of the higheſt Faith towards him,
that dogs might partake of the crums that fall from their Maſters
table. I inſtance in theſe, becauſe I would prevent and remove
any exception which might be taken from them. For otherwiſe
Chriſts profeſſed entertainment of all ſinners was ſo open and
notorious, as it was turned into his diſgrace and opprobry, That
<hi>he was a friend to Publicans and Sinners;</hi> which yet he ownes
and glories in, profeſſing that he <hi>came not to call the righteous,
but ſinners to repentance.</hi> And how glad he was when any ſuch
came in unto him, he ſufficiently expreſſeth by thoſe parables
on purpoſe taken up, of the joy of the Prodigals father for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and of the rejoycing for the finding of the loſt groat, and
likewiſe of the loſt ſheep more then of the 99.</p>
               <p>We read of Chriſts joy but ſeldome, and when it is at any
time recorded, it is at the converſion of Soules. He had little elſe
to comfort himſelf in, being a man of ſorrows: and he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe on earth which he took delight or pleaſure in. When
he was converting the poor woman of Samaria, (which he doth
as a pleaſure and recreation to him) he forgets his meat, (although
before he had been very hungry) and tels his Diſciples that he
had <hi>meat which they knew not of,</hi> which was indeed the ſaving
that poor womans ſoul. In <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 21. we read that <hi>Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in his ſpirit;</hi> but obſerve the occaſion: He had ſent out
his Diſciples to preach the Goſpel, and they had in his Name and
through his Power caſt out Devils: He bids them not rejoyce in
that, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. but ſhews them what they ſhould rejoyce in, by his
own example, and by what moſt comforted him. <hi>Father</hi> (ſayes
he) <hi>I thank thee, that thou haſt revealed theſe things unto Babes.</hi>
This in in the next words following recorded to be the matter of
his rejoycing, he ſaw now an handſell, and an experiment of the
fruit of his Diſciples miniſtery, and comforted himſelfe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
in that as their ſouls had, ſo others of the poorer and
meaner ſort ſhould thus come in unto him.</p>
               <p>We finde him at another time in like manner rejoycing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the ſtory of his raiſing <hi>Lazarus, Iohn</hi> 11. 15. And what was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171544:16"/>
it for? Not that himſelf ſhould be glorified by ſo great a miracle,
(even the greateſt that ever he wrought) but (ſayes he) <hi>I am glad
for your ſakes that I was not there, to the end that you might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi>
He rejoyced if any of his got a little more or further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of faith. And on the other ſide, as ſorry was he when men
came not in. Witneſſe his tears over Jeruſalem, and thoſe ſpeeches
of his, <hi>Iohn 5. 34. Theſe things I ſpeake, that you might be ſaved.</hi>
And thereupon in the enſuing verſe he complainingly utters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>You will not</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>come to me, that you may have life.</hi> He
ſpeaks as one greedy of winning ſoules, and as ſorry that any cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers
or hearers of his ſhould paſſe by, and not turne in; (<hi>You
will not come to me, &amp;c.</hi>) And he relieves himſelf with this, that
there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e others that would, though they would not. So here
in this place, when in the verſe before my Text he had complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of them, that they would not beleeve, he comforts himſelf
with this in the words of the Text, <hi>All that the Father giveth
me ſhall come unto me.</hi> And the like you have, <hi>Ioh 5. 25, 26. You
beleeve not; but my ſheep, they heare my voice, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then at his death, when he was upon the Croſſe, he then
converts a thiefe that was crucified with him, and prayes for
thoſe that crucified him. And after his Reſurrection his laſt
words recorded in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. are [<hi>That remiſſion of ſins ſhould
be preached in his name, beginning at Ieruſalem,</hi>] that ſo thoſe
whom he had prayed for (though they had crucified him) might
be converted and ſaved. Thus ſtood his heart all the while he
was on earth, both before and after his death.</p>
               <p>And then (in the third place) now that he hath dyed and laid
down that price which was to purchaſe the ſalvation of ſinners,
he muſt needs be much more willing (if it were poſſible he ſhould
be) then ever. Many Demonſtrations there are from thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
which Chriſts ſufferings and death do put upon him,
which I have already given in a Treatiſe upon this very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>The heart of Chriſt in Heaven,</hi> Part 2. onely I have reſerved
one or two for this place. As,</p>
               <p>1. It was the aim and utmoſt intent of Chriſts ſoul, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
crucified to have ſinners ſaved, and ſaved effectually. It was
that travaile which his heart was then big with. And certainly,
Chriſt would not that ſo many and ſo great ſufferings, now that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:171544:16"/>
they are paſt and over, ſhould be in vaine. The Apoſtle makes a
motive of it unto the <hi>Galatians, Gal. 3. 34. Are ye ſo fooliſh,—have
ye ſuffered ſo many things in vain?</hi> To be ſure Chriſts death
ſhall not be in vain: He will not loſe the end of his ſufferings, (as
the ſame Apoſtle intimates but 4. <hi>verſes</hi> before <hi>Chap. 2. ult.</hi>) A
buſineſſe that a man hath praied for much, how doth he long to ſee
it accompliſhed and fulfilled? and how glad is he when it falls out
as he hath prayed? and why, but becauſe it is the fruit of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
Now much more glad is Chriſt to ſee the fruit of his death,
<hi>The travaile of his ſoul,</hi> and thereby is <hi>ſatisfied, Iſai.</hi> 53. 10. (a
place I often quote to this purpoſe.) I will add but this to it.
When a woman hath been in travaile, ſhe forgets all her paines
for joy that a man-childe is borne, (which is the fruit of that her
travail) and ſo doth Chriſt. And then again, for that other word,
that Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>ſatisfied.</hi> Satisfaction is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of deſire, or the fulfilling of ones longing. So in that ſpeech
of Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that hunger for they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>
So that this doth argue and preſuppoſe the moſt vehement deſires
and longings in Chriſt for the ſalvation of ſouls, and his having
dyed muſt needs encreaſe them.</p>
               <p>And 2. Adde this engagement unto that former, That his death
can be put to no other uſe then for the pardon of ſinners. So as
if he ſhould not expend it that way, he ſhould utterly loſe the
fruit of it, or let it lye uſeleſſe by him. For divert it to any other
uſe he cannot. And yet if he knew how to improve it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpoſe; yet his love (he having intended it for the ſons of
men) would not ſuffer him to do it. But beſides, if it be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
and beſtowed this way, it will be wholly in vaine; for the
good Angels, though they ſtand in need of his Perſonall mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to confirme them in grace; yet his blood was not requiſite
thereunto. And for the bad Angels, they are utterly excluded
the benefit of it. And then Chriſt himſelf he ſtands in no need of
it, nor can he have any benefit by it; all that Perſonall glory
which now he hath in Heaven being due unto him by that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall
union. So that his death ſerves for no end, if not for
this. Chriſt indeed hath an honour in Heaven, beſides the glory
of the perſonall union: but then it ariſeth to him from the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſinners through his death, which ſalvation is the purchaſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171544:17"/>
of his blood; as you have it. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. which might afford a third
engagement, In that Chriſt ſhould not only loſe the fruit of his
death, but that glory that is ordained him by the ſalvation of
men. So that he ſhould be a loſer not only of his ſufferings by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,
but of all that glory that is to come from the ſalvation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
which is no ſmall thing unto him. As Officers in Courts
of Law, or in Univerſities, get the more fees, the more Clients,
and the more Commercers there are: ſo it is the more for Jeſus
Chriſts gain, that many ſinners get out, and are received to grace
and mercy.</p>

               <head>Some Extrinſecall demonſtrations of Gods and Chriſts
willingneſſe to pardon ſinners.</head>
               <p>ANd unto all theſe ſecret engagements both of God and
Chriſt mutually to each other, and to us, we may adde all
the profeſſed publications of their minds herein unto us, which
have been made upon all occaſions and by all means poſſible. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, This newes hath been publiſhed by all three perſons,
firſt God the Father he began to preach it to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe,
and hath renued it again and again, as with his own immediate
voice from Heaven when Chriſt was baptized, <hi>This is my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved
Son in whom I am well pleaſed, heare him:</hi> which the
Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> records and confirmes, as ſpoken a ſecond time
upon the Mount, as a matter of higheſt moment to be known by
us, <hi>which voyce he heard</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and is no fable, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt who is the <hi>faithfull and true witnes, Rev.</hi> 1. 5.
he came from the boſome of his Father, and <hi>preached peace,
Epheſ.</hi> 2. 17. Yea and it was one of his firſt texts he preached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Luke 4. 18. The spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath
anoynted me to preach the Goſpel, to preach deliverance to the
captives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, The</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>he alſo herewith</hi> bearing witneſſe, that
God hath exalted Chriſt to be a Prince and Saviour, to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. Acts 5. 31, 32. <hi>And ſo</hi> Heb. 2.
45. <hi>And theſe are theſe</hi> three witneſſes in heaven, 1 John 5. 7.
<hi>whoſe record as it followes is this,</hi> that there is life to be had in
his Son Jeſus Chriſt, v. 11.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:171544:17"/>
               <p>Secondly, God hath publiſhed this newes both <hi>by all creatures</hi>
reaſonable, and <hi>to all creatures</hi> reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Angels they came and preached it, ſinging, <hi>Peace on
earth, good will towards men Luke</hi> 2. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By men, and to that end he hath given <hi>gifts to men,</hi>
powerfull and full of glory, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. &amp;c. And a commiſſion
with thoſe gifts, a moſt large and gratious one, <hi>And he hath
committed to us the miniſtery of reconciliation,</hi> to wit, <hi>that God
was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
               <p>Yea and thirdly, he hath maintained this miniſtry in all ages,
even to our times, all times have rung of the newes hereof, and
the world is ſtill full of his Embaſſadors to treat with men about
this peace, and they are to proclaime that he is fully willing; and
upon that ground to beſeech men to be reconciled, and ſo long
as Leiger Embaſſadors reſide uncalled home, or not ſent for away,
ſo long the treaty of peace holds.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He hath proclaimed this by theſe this Embaſſadors in
all places; he bad them go and preach it to all the world, <hi>to every
creature, Mark</hi> 16. 15. And his Diſciples did accordingly. Now
he would not have had it ſpoken ſo openly and generally, if he
were not moſt ſerious in it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Adde to this, that he hath declared it by all wayes and
meanes that do argue faithfulneſſe and ſeriouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Not by bare word of mouth, but we have it under his
hand, he hath left his mind in <hi>writing.</hi> This book which is dropt
from heaven, the title of it is, <hi>The word of reconciliation. 2 Cor.</hi>
5. 19. the main argument of it being reconciliation. In this book
we find, proclamation ſent forth after proclamation, book after
book, line after line, all written to this end, that <hi>we ſinners might
have hope and ſtrong conſolation,</hi> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He hath added to this writing thoſe ſeales of the
Sacraments, and further an oath to both, and that made advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
with the greateſt earneſtneſſe and deliberation that might
be, <hi>Heb. 6. 17. God willing</hi> (the text ſayes) <hi>more abundantly to
manifeſt this his intent, the immutability of his counſell, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that promiſe with an oath, that by two immutable things,
his word and oath, we might have ſtrong conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If this be not ſufficient, he hath pawned heaven and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:171544:18"/>
earth, the <hi>Covenant of day and night</hi> in Mortgage to forgive ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and pardon ſinners. Thus <hi>Jer. 31. 34, 35, 36. This is my
Covenant</hi> (ſayes God there) <hi>that I will forgive their iniquities,
and remember their ſinnes no more,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 34. and then it follows
<hi>ver. 35. Thus ſaith the Lord, who giveth the ſun for a light by day,
and the ordinances of the moon and ſtars for a light by night: If
thoſe ordinances depart from before me, then the ſeed of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi>
The like you have, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. 25, 26. Day and night we ſee ſtand
ſtill, and therefore this Covenant holds good ſtill; but we have a
greater pawn then this, the death of his Son.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Let his actions and courſes, which he hath taken
from the beginning of the world ſpeak for all the reſt, as ſatan
hath been a murtherer from the beginning, ſo God hath been a
Saviour from the beginning, and Chriſt is the Lamb ſlain from
the beginning of the world. God began with the firſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
even with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> the ringleaders, the heads of this
rebellion, who drew all the reſt of the world into that enmity,
theſe were yet reconciled. Kings uſually hang up the heads and
chiefe in treaſons, for examples of their juſtice, though they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
others; yet theſe did God ſave and pardon as examples of
his mercy, to all that ſhould come of them; and it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that the firſt thing he did, after the world was fallen, was
this act of mercy, both in preaching this Goſpel, and in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, he began to do that ſoon, which he meant to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a doing to the end of the world, it argues he delights in it,
yea and according to Chriſt laſt promiſe on earth, (<hi>that he would
be with us to the end of the world,</hi>) God is to this day reconciling
the world of men to himſelf. Some that walk in your ſtreets by
you, live among you. And he will have thouſands when you are
gone, and what are theſe but as flags, and patternes of mercy,
hung forth by God to toll and bring others in, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Vſe.</head>
                  <p>WHat ſhould the conſideration of theſe things work in our
hearts, but what the ſcope of the text it ſelf puts men
upon, even that they would <hi>come in unto Chriſt,</hi> and beleeve on
him, and give up their ſouls unto him? <hi>He that beleeves ſhall in
no wiſe be caſt out.</hi> As Chriſt therefore is <hi>willing:</hi> ſo ſhould we,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:171544:18"/>
be a <hi>willing people.</hi> That which keepes men off, is, that they know
not Chriſts minde and heart, think it not to be an indifferent thing
to him whether you beleeve, or no; as if he came into the world
to do this duty of dying for ſinners, ſingly in obedience to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo that men might be rendred ſavable if they will: and that
however, if they will not, he yet hath enough to ſatisfie and quiet
himſelf with, even this that he ſhall be glorified in what he hath
done, though few or none of the ſons of men be ſaved. It is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
doctrine this, to the ſalvation of men, and derogatory to
Chriſts free love. What, do we think that Jeſus Chriſt is gone to
heaven, there to complaine unto Angels of the unkindneſſe and
hardnes of mens hearts, that will not turne to him notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he hath done ſo much, and to tell what he had done for them,
and what they would not be perſwaded to do for themſelves; and
that ſo he can ſufficiently pleaſe himſelf with ſuch juſt complaints?
no ſurely; our effectuall ſalvation concernes him more then ſo:
and his heart is more fully bent upon it then thus to leave it, of
what he hath bought <hi>he will loſe nothing.</hi> The truth is, he is more
glad of us then we can be of him. The Father of the Prodigall
was the forwarder of the two to that joyfull meeting. Haſt
thou a minde? he that came down from Heaven (as himſelf
ſaith, in the text) to dye for thee, will meet thee more
then half way (as the prodigals father is ſaid to do) by his
ſpirit; he will ſend him from Heaven to thee, and at the latter day
himſelf will come again to fetch thee and receive thee to himſelf.
If among the Angels in Heaven there be joy at the converſion of a
ſinner, how much more joy is there in Chriſts heart? If there be
joy in the bed chamber men (as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeakes) what joy is there in
the bridgrooms hearts? or if among the ſtanders by, when a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
is borne into the world, how much more doth the mother
that was in travaile for it (as Chriſts ſoul was,) how much more
doth ſhe rejoyce? O therefore come in unto him. If you knew
his heart you would. As they that crucified him knew him not,
ſo neither do thoſe who beleeve not in him. If you had been on
earth with him, or if he were now here, and had this day preacht
theſe things unto you, and uttered theſe his own deſires, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
after you; how would you in troopes go all thronging after
him when the Sermon were done, and each of you come about him

you; and not leave him till you have obtained ſome word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and favour from him! Let me tell you, he had preacht this
day, but that he had other buſines to do for you in Heaven, where
he is now praying and intereceding for you, even when you are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
(as on earth we ſee he did for the Jews when they were a
crucifying him.) Now becauſe he could not for this other buſines
come himſelf, he therefore ſends us his Ambaſſadours, and we in
Chriſt ſtead do beſeech you; and <hi>it is as if Chriſt by us did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you:</hi> and we preach but ſuch things as were <hi>firſt ſpoken by
the Lord himſelfe,</hi> (as it in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.) And he ſends his ſpirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to give gifts unto men to this very day: and in all theſe
reſpects, when ever the Goſpel is preacht, he is ſaid to <hi>ſpe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>k from
heaven,</hi> Refuſe not him that ſpeaks from heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. And
though you have not his bodily preſence as they had who heard
himſelfe preach here on earth; yet you may by faith have as free
an acceſſe unto him, and know as ſurely that he heares you,
as if he were in the ſame roome with you. Retire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
into your cloſet, and treat with him in private, and there
preſſe theſe things on him; ſay them all over again unto himſelf,
and ask him if they be not true: get the match ſtruck up between
thy ſoule &amp; him; which if once made, will never be undone again.
Say unto him, Lord, why may it not be made up now? Only let me
adde this; ſee you come not to him without a wedding-garment,
and wedding-affections. Take up a reſolution to love him. For if
thou comeſt to him, what doſt thou come for? pardon of ſins? and
what is it in him that muſt procure that? his having dyed for thee;
that was it. And what was it that moved him to die? an infinite
love; ſuch a love, as were the thing yet to be done, he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do it, and die to ſatisfie God for thee. Now then, ſeeing he hath
already done it out of ſuch a love with what face canſt thou ask
pardon of him, as the effect of ſuch a love, and not love him again,
and obey him in all things? But to make ſhort work with you,
know this; that if thou wilt not come in to him, thou wilt be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
So ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that beleeves ſhall be ſaved; but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
not ſhall be damned.</hi> And I could tell you another, and as
large a ſtory of Chriſts wrath againſt thoſe that refuſe him, as I
have told you of his love: The Lamb can be angry; for he is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
