         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But, heare a word more, I told you my Spark of light was well nigh ſpent, its now ſuppli'd, or anointed with freſh oyle: miſtake me not, my deſign is not preſently, if I could, to take you off thoſe wayes wherein you are, or may be profitable in building up one another in your moſt holy faith, ſo long as there is <hi>Lambs, ſmoaking flax, or bruiſed reeds, or babes in Chriſt</hi> among you, there is need of your helping one another, till power from on high be brought forth in a more immediate way to do it, which ſhall be in the time appointed by the Father.

            <p>Honourable Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> who are managing the great Affairs of this tottering Kingdom, you are now higher than you were: I have nothing againſt it, but there is one higher than you, the Lord of Hoſts, who has his deſigns in the midſt of yours. In this ſmall volume, written by a glimſe of his light, you may take a ſmall view and ſight of his footſteps, that are, and will be upon this Kingdome, even the overturning all worldly powers, and Governments, that His may be ſet up, whoſe right all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, the Lord Jeſus, which is more pure, and ſpirituall, than any is yet in the world; to which, if you, or others, ſhall act ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviently, you may flouriſh; if not, expect yours, or their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns fruſtrated, or broken, that tend to Exaltation.

Al's pretty quiet now, and they begin to ſtrengthen, and ſettle all, almoſt exalting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as though all evill were paſt, though not a whit bettered by thoſe judgments that have been already. But behold, that line of deſolution that is ſpread over this Land, to lay its Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie yet more lower: I wiſh you would lay it to heart, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the Lord; put off, and lay by your brave Ornaments, within, and without, that the Lord may know what to doe unto you. Could I command as many drops of bloud, as teares have fallen from mine eies, or ſighs from within, as have been in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the miſeries hang over this Kingdome: I would write unto you in a more ſcarlet die. If you will read this Book, you ſhall find nothing but joy and gladneſſe proclaimed to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and that the day of their Redemption drawes nigh; but lamentation, mourning, and woe, to the wicked, be they high or low, rich or poor, noble or ignoble; thoſe in power, or not in power, I can proclaim nothing elſe; what it will coſt me, I know not: Storms I have met with already, but they cauſed me not to deſiſt from my work, but were as wind to the fire, which makes it flame the more, ſo long as God thought fit to imploy me.</p>
            <p>I have lived among divers Great Perſons many years, a poor ſervant, and now come to this hard incounter with them, it ſeems harſh; but ſurely the ſtrong Lord of Hoaſts is before, he leads, he is <hi>Light, Life, and Strength, a ſtrong Tower, a Buckler, and Shield,</hi> to help me to beare ſtripes, if need be, and to avoid their ſcornes, although they ſhould ſay, as <hi>Eliab</hi> to <hi>David, 1</hi> Sam. <hi>17. 28.

But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie not again at Bethel, for it is the Kings Chappel, and it is the Kings Court.</hi> He might as well have ſaid, <hi>Amos,</hi> this is no place to entertaine ſuch Perſons as ſhall Propheſie of Ruine, or Deſolation, although commanded by God, if you will come hither and be welcome, you muſt ſpeak pleaſing things, propheſie of Wine and ſtrong drink, and pleaſures, ſuch as are fit for great perſons, propheſie flatteries, as <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets did, <hi>1 Kin. 22. 6.</hi> and then thou ſhalt be entertained at Court, and with great ones as they were: it may be ſo now in our Land, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deceitfull Prieſts that propheſie lies and pleaſing things to the fancies of great perſons may flouriſh, when as they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth of God to them, may go in danger of the loſſe of all outward injoyments, but they will ſay I am beſide my buſineſſe, towards you O watchmen; therefore hearken, do not you like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſiah</hi> ſay, I have conſpired againſt this Land, nor that it is not able to bear all my words, nor bid me Propheſie ſomewhere elſe, or of pleaſinger things, they are the true ſayings of God, would you have me cry Peace, when the Lord cryes trouble, and ſo be conſumed for my pains, what the Lord hath ſpoken to me, that declare I to you; Oh youl ſay, Obſerve, what? he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Prophet, this is as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe and deceive many:</hi> well, they ſhall ſo, take heed you be not a kin to them: do you thinke I am guided by a deceiving ſpirit, come then, handle me, pry into me, try and ſearch me by the Scriptures, I am willing to be tryed, but you want ſight, Ile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my ſelf to the judgement of thoſe that have a clearer light then you, even the Saints: But ſecure <hi>London,</hi> what ſay you to me? what's your judgement concerning theſe ſad things threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt you, you have had many warnings from the Lord, by divers men, you haue taken little notice of them to believe them,
<pb facs="tcp:54588:4"/>
would you believe one that ſhould be raiſed from the grave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt you from the Lord? why? behold, he hath ſent one with a meſſage raiſed from the valley &amp; ſhadow of death, from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſſe that were within him, even from the belly of hel. The floods compaſſed him about, his billowes and waves paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, he was even broken, and ſhattered in pieces; his ſtrength of inward and outward man; was well nigh ſpent, as to his own view, and the view of others, laid aſide as a veſſel of no uſe, yet ſuddenly by an Almighty power, raiſed him like a Lion roaring for his prey: of a fearfull and faint heart made bold, of weak was made ſtrong, to declare as ſad a meſſage elſewhere as to you, even with, and not minding the hazzard of life. Wilt thou believe now, and turn to the Lord, whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear, know you have had a meſſage, you ſhall be inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>As for you of the Army of Officers, and Souldiers, the leaſt part of this ſmall book concerns you, as you are Souldiers, but if you war againſt Heaven, you will be conquered, notwithſtanding all your victories; the line of diſſolution will reach you, you have been ſuch, as have been made uſe of by God to work great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſalvation for Iſrael, that before was in, and under the hands of cruel, and unreaſonable men, bleſſed be his great name for it, and the Lord reward your kindneſſe and labours into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, with ſpirituull and temporall bleſſings. I know, you will many of you confeſſe, that you have ſeen much of the power of God with you, ſubduing your enemies, and that God hath ſhown much of his kindneſſe to his poore Iſrael, as in giving them ſuch deliverance as at this day, they are ſo precious and dear in his ſight, that he hath reproved and given men (I may ſay) to the ſlaughter for their ſakes: but as if that were not enough he is following them with more excellent things, even the breakings forth of his own Glorie, in a more large manner, which you may ſee a glimpſe of in this book: and what ever deſolations ſhall come upon this Kingdome, through his fullneſſe in them, they ſhall lift up their heads when others ſhall call to rocks and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to cover them from that wrath which will be upon them. The Temple of the Lord Jeſus is to be built, and exalted, yea, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with his own Glorie: the time and day growes on apace, though Iſrael it ſelf knows not what to make of it, when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>

Zech. 9. 8.</hi> Nay hearken, <hi>The Lord himſelfe will be the alone Erecter and Exalter of it,</hi> Zech. <hi>16. 12. 13.

But, who are you, O great mountaines, before the breakings forth of the Lord Jeſus? You ſhall become a plain, he ſhall be brought forth in deſpight of you, and there ſhall be ſhoutings, crying, <hi>Grace,</hi>

               <hi>Grace unto Him.

            <p>O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> conſider, is here another Goſpel? the breakings forth of another Spirit? another faith, or new propheſies? Or, is here not a taſt of the promiſes, propheſies, and words of the Prophets of old, and Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Ghriſt?

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hurches, Harken; I know you will ſtartle at this Cloudy Meſſenger, with a Sparke from the Altar, or a Beame of the Light of God, ſcattering yours, which ſeems to be as a full Sun.</p>
            <p>Many of you glory much in your Priviledges, as if the Lord were no where in his manifeſtations of Light, and Love, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you; So did the <hi>Jewes, Jer.</hi> 7. <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of you thinke your ſelves very well, and rich; I ſhould not meddle to impoveriſh, or ſtrip you of your Glory, were I not certaine I am under the teachings, and ſubſervient to the deſigne of my Father.</p>
            <p>You have, many of you, like <hi>Hannahs</hi> Adverſary, vext the ſoules of thoſe that were not under your Formes, upraiding them with barrenneſſe, and unfruitfulneſſe, boaſting of your owne. But conſider, <hi>Hannah</hi> had an Husband, and being vext with her Adverſary, cryed unto the Lord, he brought forth fruit out of her wombe, and ſhe was a joyfull mother of children, when ſhe that vext her, its poſſible, waxt feeble.</p>
            <p>To ſpiritualize it; Thoſe you have, and ſtill vex, have an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Lord Jeſus; in him is their fruit found, which he will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54588:6"/>
bring forth, and cauſe them to be fruitfull, and ſtrong, when you may be weake, and feeble: Then ſhall they ſing <hi>Hannahs</hi> Song of Joy, read it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Therefore, talke no more ſo exceeding proudly, let not arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy come out of your mouthes; <hi>For the Lord is a God of knowledge, by him actions are weighed, they that ſtumbled, are, and ſhall be girt with ſtrength,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 4. Pſal. 113. 7. 8. <hi>He raiſeth up the poore,</hi> (even ſuch as you deſpiſe) <hi>out of the duſt, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill, that he may ſet him with Princes, even with the Princes of his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hearken ſtill; Tell many of you of a ſpirituall Glory, thats contrary to yours; or a Land more excellent than yours; one may almoſt as ſoone make a blind man beleeve the Moone is made of cheeſe, (as ſaith the Proverb) as cauſe you to ſee this ſpirituall Land; <hi>that is,</hi> diſcoveries above, and contrary to yours.</p>
            <p>I have been wandring a long time like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, as the Spies to ſearch the Land, I have ſeene it afar off, behold a branch, or a cluſter of its fruit, its a glorious land, only with pure, ſpirituall glory, the inhabitants are very wiſe, and ſtrong, but with the wiſedome and ſtrength of the Lord of Hoaſts, no need of any low, or inferiour light, but the pure light of God; no need of Teachers, to ſay, <hi>Know the Lord;</hi> no feare of Enemies, <hi>The gates ſtand open.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its very pure, nothing but holineſſe there; its very ſtrong, <hi>the Lord himſelfe is walls and bulwarks.</hi> There may be Dogs, and ravenous Beaſts about it, they may attempt to ſtorme it, but they ſhall ſoone be deſtroyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 9. This ſpirituall Land of <hi>Canaan, is altogether glorious:</hi> When the Lord has given me a more cleare view of it, if he thinkes fit, you ſhall heare of it.</p>
            <p>But Churches, hearken: Many of you boaſt much of your ſtrong Pillars, that will beare up your building to the end of all things almoſt, I mean thoſe Scriptures that are ſo frequently brought to prove the continuance of your practiſe; but I ſpare you, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Diſciples were ignorant to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, though taught by him, living under his teaching of their meaſure. Yet hearken, theres a great deal of danger in your way, and practice, in retaining thoſe Scriptures that make for you, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54588:6"/>
and clear contradiction to many others. You boaſt much of them, to prove your way, if that be true which many of you hold out, if the light of God did not lead me, I might queſtion the authority of them, which I doe not, but am rather confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the excellency of them, or elſe not know what to make of them.</p>
            <p>But Churches, hearken ſtill: Becauſe many of you are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that I may not beat the aire, or ſpeak at uncertainty, what will you ſay to thoſe Scriptures that prove your deſolution?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider thoſe Scriptures that promiſe, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the large meaſure of the fulneſſe of God, the Saints ſhall be filled withall in the laſt daies, and then tell how long you thinke your building can ſtand, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. <hi>I will poure out my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; your old men ſhall dreame dreames, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions. And ſo, upon the ſervants, and upon the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, in thoſe dayes will I powre out my Spirit,</hi> Zech. 12. 8. <hi>In that day ſhall the Lord defend the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and he that is feeble among them at that day, ſhall be as</hi> David, <hi>and the houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them.</hi> Zech. 10. 5. <hi>And they ſhall be as mighty men, which tread downe their enemies in the mire of the ſtreets; in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they ſhall fight, becauſe the Lord is with them, and the Riders of horſes ſhall be confounded.</hi> Zech. 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>And they of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>ſhall be like a mighty man, and their heart ſhal rejoyce as through wine, yea their children ſhall ſee it, and be glad, their heart ſhall rejoyce in the Lord.

            <p>Churches harken, this mirth preſages ſadneſſe to your building; doth it not appear to you weaker then it was, how ever, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, theres more yet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 8. 21. <hi>And it ſhall be in that day, that living waters ſhall go out from Ieruſalem, half of them towards the former ſea, and half of them toward the hinder ſea, in Summer and in Winter ſhall it be, and there ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> Mic. 3. 7. <hi>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was caſt far off a ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Lord ſhall reign over them in mount Sion, from hence forth, even for ever.</hi> Iſa. 33. <hi>And the inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick.</hi> Rev. 21. 1, 2. <hi>And there was no more ſea; and I</hi> John <hi>ſaw the holy City coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband.</hi> All theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do clearly prove the abundance of grace, and ſpirituall glory the Saints ſhall have powred upon them, from that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their head, the Lord Jeſus. When this time comes, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Churches, you will ſtagger like a drunken man. You that are not taken up into, and made partakers of this glory, you will not know what to do with your ſelves, youle be like him that cryed after his God.</p>
            <p>Awaken your ſelves, and hearken ſtill, and ſecondly conſider thoſe Scriptures that hold forth a diſſolution of your Formes of worſhip, what if I ſhould ſay Ordinances? as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in them. Remember it is but a Spark from the Altar, a beam of the light of God, that declares your diſſolution: if your light be as a full Sun, ſit ſtill, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e through me; fall not upon me with harſh cenſures. What can a Spark, a beam of light ſee; but conſider, for in that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 22. 23. <hi>And the Street of the City was pure Gold, and as it were tranſparent glaſſe; and I ſaw no Temple therein: for the Lord God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and the Lamb are the Temple of it, and the City had no need of the Sunne, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54588:7"/>
If this Scripture may be interpreted concerning the Glory of the Church on earth, as it may be compared with others, which cannot fully be done now with a beam of light: but if the Lord pleaſe, it may hereafter; but if it may be interpreted ſo as you cannot clearly deny, then what will become of your Churches which many expect ſhall even laſt near as long as Sunne and Moon endures.</p>
            <p>Hearken ſtill, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 1. Epiſt. John 2. 27. <hi>But the annointing which you have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame annointing teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you of all things, and is truth, and is no ly.</hi> Theſe Scriptures, I expect ſhall be fulfilled in the very letter of them, I conceive your quick apprehenſions, in part, to quarrell againſt this, but Ile let you alone, till the Spark or beam of light be increaſt: Ile leave to your further conſideration to confirm the ſcattering of you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3. 4. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 19. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. and when you have conſidered theſe, and thoſe quoted and ſet down before; tell truly what will become of that famous building many ſo much adore. I ſhall hardly heare, of the reſult of your thoughts, therefore know from a beam of the light of God, concerning your building, there will not be one ſtone left uponanother. The houſe of your glorie will be left deſolate.</p>
            <p>But come now let us reaſon, I know you ſtartle, and are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at the Spirituall and heavenly voice of Chriſt, as the Diſciples were when Chriſt ſpoke to them in a form they had not converſed with him in: ſo do you let the Spirituall voice of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus come amongſt you, which tends to deſtroy your fleſhly forms or knowledge: you are terrified, and affrighted, and cry out a Spirit, but a deceiving one: I grant you, it is abroad: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving one may act very like the true breakings forth of the Spirit of God, take heed you be not offended at the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe error is abroad.</p>
            <p>I certainly believe there are many choiſe ſpirits among you, to them I declare, my deſire is not to force you out of your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular wayes of worſhip; but if you meet with the preſence of the Lord, walk there, and I ſay unto you, as it was ſaid to the

Diſciples, <hi>tarry at Ieruſalem till you be endued with power from on high,</hi> to ariſe from what you are: but in the mean time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of paſsing ſuch cenſures as uſually comes from many that are of your Aſſemblies: you think, it is poſsible, you are very high in Principles, there be thoſe that are higher: they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe you; if their highneſſe be of God, it teaches no ſuch thing, ſo far as they are acted by the true light of God, if they do, it is from the darkneſſe that is in them, do not you judge them.</p>
            <p>Hearken ſtill, and more which proves your ſcattering, or the diſſolution of your practiſe, though many of you be glewd as cloſe to it almoſt as your fleſh to your bones: conſider that Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. the coming of the Lord Jeſus to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a devouring fire to burn and deſtroy the filthineſſe that is in his Saints. The effects of his coming is to difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the righteous and the wicked, between them that fear God, and them that fear him not: this Scripture reaches theſe laſt dayes, you are converſing one with another, with a great deal of comfort, becauſe you are joyned together in an outward forme: but there will be found many falſe ones among you, when this day comes; and ſurely, then you will be ſhaken, and that day tend to your ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O <hi>London,</hi> in thee was I nouriſhed many years; for thy happineſſe I have ſuffered much, my blood had not been dear to me, ſo thou mighteſt have flouriſhed, and have been a City that the Lord would have taken pleaſure in; my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells are yearning after thee, I muſt bear witneſſe againſt thee for all this; and how am I ſtraitened till it be accompliſhed; from the dayes of thy Fathers, thou haſt departed from the Lord: the Lord ſent his meſſengers in the midſt of thee to call thee to return to him, what uſage they had, thou, and many in the world knowſt to thy ſhame: your Fathers, where are they? the Prophets, do they live for ever, but hath not the words of his ſervants taken hold on you?</p>
            <p>The day of the Lords anger they ſpoke of, how hath it been accompliſhed on you, theſe years paſt, thou haſt, &amp; art ſet on fire, yet thou knoweſt it not, you are conſuming, but lay it not to heart.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath yet a farther controverſie with thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art unmindfull of him, he brings forth his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments morning by morning, but thou takeſt no ſhame, his judgements are in thee, and about thee, but thou learneſt not righteouſneſſe, nor beholdeſt the Majeſty ofthe Lord; his hand hathbeen, and is lifted up againſt thee; thou wilt not ſee, but thou ſhalt ſee, and be aſhamed for all thy abominations, (or confounded by the fury of the Lord.)</p>
            <p>O <hi>London,</hi> conſider what plagues, what unſeaſonable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what want of bread hath been in thee in former years? but thou returneſt not to the Lord!</p>
            <p>But behold, and tremble for fear, O <hi>London,</hi> that bloody war that was brought forth, not by the power of man, but from, and by the Lord of hoſts: how many thouſands of thy men are ſlain with the Sword, how are the widdows, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe increaſed in thee: how are thy riches exhauſted? what leading into captivity? what complaining in thy ſtreets?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54588:10"/>
How art thou forced to be ſervant to thoſe that formerly thou wouldſt have deſpiſed! (thou doſt it now, but canſt thou help thy ſelf?) O <hi>London,</hi> what vexatiouſneſſe of ſpirit haſt thou? what a trembling heart is in the midſt of thee? a great and ſad conſumption is upon you: But that which is the greateſt plague of all, and declares a further conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon you, is, you are not bettered by the judgement of the Lord.</p>
            <p>You are at peace in appearance now, and you think the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of death is over: but a deceived heart hath deceived you, <hi>London!</hi> I beſeech you in the name of the Lord conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Lord hath yet a further cotroverſie with you: <hi>his hand is ſtretched out ſtill:</hi> thy ſinnes remain: your ſpots are not the ſpots of the Lords people: but of rebellious Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that refuſe to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it; you refuſe to return, your pride teſtifies to your face, you will refrain turning to the Lord, and you will refrain turning away his anger. What people ever ſet themſelves againſt the Lord, and proſpered: how furiouſly hath the Lord marched up and down amongſt us: how are his garments died in blood: not of the mean men onely, but of the mighty; thy mighty and thy honourable men are fallen in thy ſtreets: yet his anger is not turned away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London!</hi> mind that Thunderclap given to you of late: the Lord was there, itpreaches to you, that unleſſe you repent, you ſhall periſh alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London!</hi> in thee, &amp; againſt thee is found the blood and cryes of poor ſaints, acry of oppreſſion, the cry of the poor unminded: a cry, yea, and a horrible cry of abomination, that hath, that ſtill doth come up into the ears of the Lord of Hoſts. <hi>London,</hi> is there no healing for you, are your wounds incurable? nothing but the blood of Jeſus can waſh you from your filthines, wh<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> to your ſhame you deſpiſe: What ſhall I ſay unto you, be inſtructed, leſt the ſoul of God depart from you, and he take no pleaſure in you: <hi>London,</hi> you are conquered and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome in your power by men, that it cannot break forth to mannage Warre againſt them: but your inward power that maintaines Warre againſt heaven is unſubdued, you are yet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54588:10"/>
found fighters againſt God: but he will beſtronger then you: and overcome you by his ſtrong power in deſpite of thee.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath lain ſtill a long time, and you thought he had forgotten, or forſaken the earth; but he is, and will riſe more and more with fury in his face, to recompence wrath to his, and his peoples enemies: to make up his Iewells, and glorifie the houſe of his glory, that is, his Saints, whom you have ſo much deſpiſed, and trampled under foot, you have ruled, they muſt rule. You that have been, and ſtill are enemies to the Lord, your beſt dayes are paſt, the dayes of Zions joyes are coming: the Lord muſt be King over all the earth, the Lord will come gloriouſly too, and in his Saints. You enemies to God make haſte, you wicked generation, what you do, do quickly, the Lord is coming apace, with ſorrow and mourning to you, but with joy and gladneſſe to his Iſrael. How will you like it wordlings? to ſee the Saints rule 'twill vex you, but you cannot help it: they muſt be the head, you the tail, the Lord Ieſus will reigne in them, you muſt be ſpoiled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. <hi>Behold a King ſhall reigne in Righteouſneſſe, and Princes ſhall rule in Judgement.</hi> Ezek. 39. 10. <hi>And they ſhall ſpoil thoſe that ſpoiled them, and rob thoſe that robbed them, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How will you like this you ſtout ſpirits, to ſee the Saints ſpoil you, and you to be their ſervants, and come bowing to them, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 60. 14. <hi>The ſonnes of them that afflicted thee ſhall come bending unto thee, they that deſpiſe thee ſhall bow themſelves down at the ſoles of thy feet:</hi> the Lord will manifeſt himſelf ſo in his Saints, and he hath begun it already, that the proudeſt of you, if you will not honour and exalt them, woe unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>As youtender (O <hi>London)</hi> your own happineſſe and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, repent of your deſpiſing the Saints, and take heed of offending them hereafter, the Lord hath, and will reprove Kings and great ones for their ſakes. But <hi>London</hi> thou boaſteſt of thy Religious enjoyments, thy prayers and faſtings; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe, you cry as thoſe in <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 11. and are like them, <hi>You lean upon the Lord, and ſay, is not the Lord among us, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill can come upon us:</hi> be not deceived, ſo did the Iſraelites ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, <hi>Zec.</hi> 7. <hi>And yet the Lord took no pleaſure in them.</hi>

it is poſſible, he takes as little in you. You will ſay, are all our dayes of faſting in vain. Hear you that are enemies to God, he takes as little delight in your Sacrifices, as in thoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London,</hi> thou thinkeſt there be thoſe in thee, that God hears their prayers; it is true, that God hears the prayers of the Saints, but you ſhall have but little benefit by it, that warre againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they have praied much for the prevention of ſpilling that blood that hath been ſpilt, and for the avoyding thoſe Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they ſaw hang over this Land: but you ſee they could not prevail, their praiers returned into their own boſomes: they pray now much, but it is for the breaking forth of a ſpirituall glorie: a vexation to you, O Rebellious people: you ſhall (it is poſſible) ſee it, but not taſt thereof; <hi>London,</hi> conſider thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Bridegroom is coming, he yet intreats thee to return, if thou wilt not, he will ſend plagues upon you, till he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed thee; and leave a poore people, and afflicted, and they ſhall fear, and praiſe the name of the Lord, which you refuſe to doe. Heare this from the Lord by the unworthieſt of men,</p>

            <head>A voice to high and low, ſhewing what the determination of the Lord ſeemes to be on this Land.</head>
            <p>HIgh &amp; low, hearken, the Lord of Hoſts is come, and ſtil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his decree is like that of <hi>Nebuchaduezzar,</hi> Dan. 3. 29. <hi>I make a Decree, that every people, nation, and language, which ſpeak any thing amiſſe againſt the God of Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, ſhall be cut in pieces, and their houſe ſhall be made a dunghill:</hi> this is the determination of God upon all thoſe that ſhall ſpeak, or act, any thing amiſſe againſt the God of Iſrael, unleſſe they repent; and that which the Lord hath begun already to do, he hath, and is ſtill a making good, that Propheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. Read it, O <hi>England,</hi> to thy ſorrow, who wouldeſt have emptied this Land of the Saints, and deſtroyed them, now thou art near deſtruction thy ſelf, the day of the Lord is come againſt all thoſe powers, that wereas Cedars, as Oaks, as high mountaines, he hath powred contempt upon Princes, <hi>Pſal</hi> 107. <hi>and cauſed them to wander in the wilderneſſe, where there is no way,</hi> and that promiſe is now fulfilled. It ſhall come to paſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 21. <hi>that the Lord ſhall puniſh the hoſt of the high ones that are on high, and the Kings of the earth upon the earth,</hi> Iſa. 23. 9. <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath purpoſed it to ſtain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable upon the earth.</hi> This he hath done already very much. You preſent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that have been as a rod, and ſtaffe in Gods hand for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of his deſigne, tremble, and fear, and avoid walking in their ſteps: think not your power ſo ſtrong, that it cannot be moved, for that ſtrong God which overturned thoſe powers that were before you, is able, and will moſt certainly daſh you in pieces, if you ſhall walk in their ſteps of oppreſſion and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 75. 5. <hi>Lift not up your horn on high, ſpeak not with a ſtiffe neck; for promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, but God is the Judge, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> If you will honour God, he will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you; if not, you ſhall be lightly eſteemed, both of God, and his Saints, for they are looking for a ſpirituall glorie and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54588:12"/>
power; and will eſteem of you, as you act by the breakings forth of a ſpirituall light in you.</p>
            <p>You corrupted ones of what degree ſoever; how have you deſpis'd the poor Saints, and ſcornd the excellent of the Earth? Now is God lifted up, now is he exalted, and they ſhall deſpiſe you, <hi>Howle you great ones,</hi> what a ſad day, by the light of God, doe I ſee comming upon you; your Glory is gone, the Saints ſhall ſee through you now, by the light of the Father. You painted Sepulchers, what ever you are, if you will not exalt the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, they'l eſteeme of you no more, than the mire in the ſtreets: many of them have eſteemed of you, and hath got their bread with ſorrow of heart among you, becauſe of that abundance of vanity that was in you, and that darkneſſe that was in their own ſpirits; they durſt not ſpeake to you for feare of your power; their Father will fill them with his own glory, then ſhall they not fear your faces.</p>
            <p>You Great ones that have, and yet doe, oppreſſe the Saints; put off your brave Ornaments, and mourne, for the day of your joy is much ſpent, vexation and diſquiet of heart you muſt have, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> joy and gladneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Saints deliverance muſt be in the deſtruction of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward enemies; you enemies of the Lord in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> conſider, turn to the Lord ſpeedily; the door of mercy is ſeemingly yet open, it may be ſoon ſhut; you will cry for pitty then, but there ſhall be none; but as you have rejoyced at the ſorrowes of the godly, ſo ſhall they rejoyce in yours. <hi>Zion heard and was glad, and the Daughters of Judah rejoyced becauſe of thy Judgements, O Lord,</hi> Pſal. 107. 42.</p>
            <p>When God is pouring contempt on Princes, on the great ones of the Earth, the Righteous ſhall ſee it and rejoyce. You Enemies of the Lord, be you great men, or others, read in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> what Songs the Saints ſhall ſing, its your doom, and day of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>The day of the Lord is come, O <hi>England!</hi> a day of wrath and fury, a Conſumption is in this Land; many ſorrowes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, more behind: yea, ſuch a day as yet, was never upon it. <hi>Alas, for that day is great, ſo that none is like it,</hi> Jer. 30. 7.</p>
            <p>I have heard a voyce of trembling, of fear, and not of peace: Wherefore doe we ſee every man with his hand on his loynes, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54588:12"/>
a woman in travell: all faces are turned into paleneſſe; the Foules of the Air knowes the time of their comming, but thou, O <hi>England,</hi> knoweſt not the comming of the Lord, it preſages more ruine to thee.</p>
            <p>The day of the Lord makes haſte, wherein he alone muſt be exalted in his own pure ſtrength and wiſedome. Rulers take heed you act in the pure wiſedome of God; all your fleſhly wiſedome muſt be deſtroyed, and the deſignes it thinks to effect will be fruſtrated, to your ſorrow and griefe, that are not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
            <p>The day is come, the Lord marches on ſtill, wherein he hath, and will ſift, and fanne thee, O <hi>England!</hi> you ſee how the Lord hath diſcovered your ſpirits, one to another. Parliament, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, you ſeem to be more pure then others; there's droſſie and chaffie ſpirits amongſt you; ſurely the Lord will ſearch you yet more. Take heed the next diſcovery be not by the breaking forth of a ſpirituall glory and power, in thoſe that are upright amongſt you: ſurely the Lords ſeparating day's at hand, to divide between Sheep and Goats, who are yet ſo mingled, that nothing but the pure light of God can diſcover.</p>
            <p>O <hi>England!</hi> this will not be one of the leaſt of thy plagues, that are comming upon thee: you ſeem to be like thoſe <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. deſiring delighting in, and longing for the comming of Jeſus to his Temple. He makes haſte, but who may abide his comming? He comes like a Refiners Fire, and Fullers Sope, to take away that filthineſſe that is in his Saints; then ſhall they return, and diſcern between the Righteous and the Wicked: and what a ſad day this will be to thee, O <hi>England</hi> judge.</p>
            <p>The day of the Lord is come, and haſtens greatly for thee O <hi>Iſrael!</hi> for thee O captive Daughter, <hi>Zion,</hi> who lyeſt in the duſt among the pors in the valley and ſhadow of death; how doeſt thou mourn, by reaſon of the oppreſſors within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, thou feareſt continually, there is none to guid, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee, almoſt amongſt thy friends; thou art drunk, yet not with Wine, but with the fury of the Lord; thou fainteſt as thou travaileſt up and down; thou art as a wild Bull in a Net, the more thou ſtriveſt to get out of thy miſery, the more thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled: thou proſtratſt thy ſelfe to thy Enemies, that ſay, bow down that we may goe over thee: and how have they darkned

O ſad ſoule conſider, Is any thing too hard for God? he will worke, and who ſhall let him, if he ſay, take away thy filthy garments, they are gone; be full, thou art full, he will fill thee with his own preſence, then ſhall the enemy be thruſt out, and the ſpoilers ſpoild: <hi>The dayes of thy mourning ſhall have an end; deliver thy ſelf, O</hi> Zion, <hi>that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with the Daughter of</hi> Babylon, <hi>the Lord will contend with thoſe that have vext thee, they ſhall be conſumed by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his appearing; thou ſhalt rejoyce according to the dayes of thy mourning.</hi> How hath thy King, O <hi>Zion,</hi> caſt down thine enemies in this Kingdome? he will goe on, and thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, when the world ſhall howle for ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 13. 14, 15.

with you: You have fed your ſelves, and not the Flock; you have ſought your ſelves, and not them: You have been cruell, in rejecting, and ſcattering them. And now behold, the Lord is, and will be cruell, ſcattering, and rejecting you: You howl and cry already, becauſe no man will buy your wares. Yee Merchants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> did you thinke it poſſible, ſo great judgments ſhould have come upon you in ſo little time? Alas for you, you blind guids, how doe you travaile up and downe in ſorrow, and yet more is your portion ſtill? How will you live? The Lord will take of his Saints which you have deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for Prieſts, and Levites. Do not you ſee how they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed already? They were but as a cloud of a hand breadth, and now they are almoſt ſpread over the Land. Are they not as a great Army?

            <p>Watchmen, what doe you ſee? Doe you ſee men like trees? Does the light appeare to you to be neither cleare nor darke? Are you brought into a Wilderneſs, not in temporall, but ſpirituall things? You will ſay, no, this is new light, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.

of the Lord is darke over you; the breakings forth of the Sunne of Righteouſneſs is upon the Saints, it will break forth to a perfect day. Light, Life, and Glory, is among the Iſrael of God; but darkneſs and obſcurity among you. But you'l ſay, you are Miniſters of the Goſpel, and light is amongſt you: So were the Scribes and Phariſees Teachers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as you in <hi>England.</hi> They could declare to <hi>Herod,</hi> the place where Chriſt ſhould be borne. But when he was born, and choſe poor deſpiſed, and ignorant perſons, to proclaime his Glory in the World, who greater Enemies to him than they. Hearken, you that have, and would pretend to be our Leaders, have not many of you acknowledged, and preacht ſomething of glorious times which were to come, even the comming of the Lord Jeſus in Spirit. Why, behold, he is come, and ſtill comming in his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Glorie; but the perſons he hath appeared to, are ſo mean, and poore; ſo ſinfull, and unworthy; that you, (O ignorant Watchmen) and thouſands more in the Kingdome, are offended, and ſtumble, even to the ruine of your poore ſoules, unleſs you repent.</p>
            <p>Hearken, you know who could tell where Chriſt was borne in the Fleſh, the Shepheards: The place where he was laid, in the Manger. Watchmen, would you know the place, or the perſons, in whom the Lord Jeſus will be born, or bring forth himſelfe gloriouſly in, its poſſible, in the vileſt, and unworthieſt of men, that you ſhould ſtumble; and the riches of his mercy exalted towards them: <hi>They will love much, becauſe much was forgiven them.</hi> But take notice, the breakings forth of this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, gives no liberty, but deſtroyes, and conſumes the filthineſs of their natures, who are partakers of it. Would you hear of the Spirituall Glorie, and Excellencie of the Lord Jeſus? Goe to the Plough-men, to the Shops, to the Souldiery, and many other places, and there you may find thoſe that can declare much of it to you: But you will goe neer to periſh before you will doe ſo, therefore you lie down in darkneſs.</p>
            <p>You careleſs Guides, the Lord is angry with you: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor ſouls has been loſt, whom you pretended to be Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to, and you never gave them warning of their danger, but even luld them aſleep: You walk in lies: You have, and doe, ſtrengthen the hands of evill doers, that they returne not from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54588:14"/>
their wickedneſs. You deſerve to periſh for them; the Cry of the poore oppreſſed Husbandman is againſt you, whom you have defrauded, by requiring part of their increaſe, not minding their precious ſoules for it, like greedy and cruell dogs as you are, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 11. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. You may ſay, the State gives it you, let them looke it be not laid to their charge. The true Miniſters of Chriſt, in former time, never required the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to enact Lawes to conſtrain people to maintaine them; nor did they make ſuch a trade of Preaching as you doe, to ſell the word of God as men ſell beaſts. You ignorant and beaſtly Watchmen, thoſe whom you have ſheltred your ſelves ſo much under, might as lawfully make a Law, to drive you from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, to the plough, or dig the ground, and as juſt it would be.</p>
            <p>Watchmen, come, are you for Peace? You'l ſay, with all your hearts, never good daies ſince we have had ſuch diviſions. But Hypocrites, hearken, they that put not into your mouthes, you prepared Warre againſt them. But remember, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares is it ſince <hi>Iſraels</hi> troubles were? How did you help them forward? How did you rejoice in their afflictions? Now is, and ſhall be the time of your woe and calamitie; they ſhall help forward, and rejoyce in yours; yea, they ſhall give you a double portion of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Hearken ſtill: You wait for a day to Reigne as you have done: You'l pay theſe Preachers their wags then, will you not? But ſtay, you may be deceiv'd, the Lord does not bring forth children for the Slaughter: Know it, ye ravenous wolves; if you wait for it, you may ſtarve before that day come: I know you are hungrie, and thirſtie, after the bodies and bloud of the Saints, like your Fore-runner, <hi>Bonner,</hi> of whoſe Tribe you are: Would you be content to ſatisfie your hungry appetites on him that is writing to you; if my Father thinks fit, and gives me life and ſtrength, you ſhall. But hearken,</p>
            <p>Watchmen, be inſtructed, be wiſe in time, meedle no more with the Saints, you will but trouble and moleſt your ſelves, and yet not conquer them. Behold what you have pul'd upon your heads, by medling with them in former yeares, the ſame you ſhall meet with ſtill. Read <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. <hi>I will make Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem a Cap of trembling unto all the people round about, when they ſhall be in the Siege againſt it: The Lord will make his</hi>

               <hi>people like a harth of fire among the Wood, like a torch of fire in the Sheafe, and they ſhall devoure all the people round about.</hi> But againe; <hi>In that day will I make Jeruſalem a burthenſome ſtone for all people, all that burthen themſelves with it ſhall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the Earth were gathered together againſt it.</hi> Therefore, be you quiet, and be content, if the Lord of Hoaſts think fit, and be their ſervants, though it be to hew their wood, and draw their water; and if you will yet preach, preach this, that the Kingdome is to be given to the Saints of the moſt High God, and that the Lord has, and will, reprove, and deſtroy, the great ones of the Kingdome for their ſakes, if they will yet oppoſe, and labour to deſtroy the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of God in them.</p>
            <p>Watchmen, heare yet, the day of the Lord haſtens greatly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to ſtaine, and bring downe all fleſhly and worldly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and, out of its ruine, bring forth a pure and ſpirituall Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his Saints.

               <p>I Hope you will not ſtartle, or be offended at thoſe harſh words ſpoken to thoſe lazie Paſtors, or puniſhments denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them: They are words of Scripture, or according to it; the puniſhments, ſuch as are threatned by the Lord againſt ſuch a Generation of men as they are; my deſire is not to caſt contempt upon you, but to incourage the loweſt appearance of God in you, though you be but one of a hundred to thoſe falſe Paſtors. It has been ſo, what a company of falſe Prophets were there to one <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 6. And ſurely, our Land may parallel <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wherein is many falſe Teachers, for one that is true and faithfull: But the Lord knowes who are his, though men know not one from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friends,</hi> The Lord Jeſus moſt certainly is haſting with a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtation of himſelf, in, and for his Saints. My deſire is not ſo much to teach you, but, as a friend, deſire you to take heed you act nothing againſt him, which (its poſſible) you may doe, by reaſon of that darkneſſe that remaines in you unſubdued, and deſtroyed by light of God. The way he comes in, is, and will be contrary to the wiſedome of fleſh; its poſſible, you ſhall not have the firſt ſight, or diſcovery of this Glory. The Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt out of the Grave, was made known to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen,</hi> out of whom Chriſt had caſt many Devils, before the Diſciples, and to two others unexpectedly in their journey: they declared, but the Diſciples beleeved them not, their words ſeemed as tales: The Lord Jeſus will have his Reſurrection in the hearts of the Saints, and that ſuch a one, as will cauſe a great Earth-quake in them, even to the deſtroying thoſe powers of darkneſſe that ſhall ſtriv to keep him down; and what if he ſhall thus ſo appear, and raiſe up himſelf, firſt in thoſe that wereas great ſinners as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was, avd they ſhall declare this glad tidings, and proclaime this glory, that the Lord is riſen, and will riſe more and more in his Temple. Why ſhould this offend you? May not he doe with his owne what he will? Give as much to a poore Prodigall, or more, than to you that have continued in your Fathers houſe? What if the unworthieſt of men, yea, the laſt be firſt in this diſcoverie of Jeſus; be not troubled, or offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, the Viſion may ſpeak in you, though it tarrie: wait for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54588:16"/>
it, and with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſee this day, and rejoice. You will aske what day doe we ſpeake of: Why, the day of <hi>Iſraels</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Spirituall bondage and captivitie wherein they lie, whoſe oppreſſors ſhall be deſtroyed by the brightneſs of his appearing, a Glorie to be manifeſted in theſe laſt claies to the Saints. Read thoſe Scriptures which ſay, <hi>Sorrow and ſighing ſhal fly away, all teares ſhall be wip't from their eyes: There ſhall be no more a</hi> Canaanite <hi>in the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> And thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies that concerne theſe laſt daies, and you ſhall ſee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things ſpoken of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Citie of the Lord of Hoſts, which ſome have a glimſe of, and are earneſtly longing for their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to a perfect day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Friends,</hi> I would not have you think, that I conceive the various transformations of the Devill, as an Angel of light, to be theſe glorious diſcoveries of Jeſus: But its certaine, the Lords diſcoveries are amongſt us, the Devill is ſo buſie in acting like him. Take this as a rule from one that waits for clearer light, what ever Principle gives way to the Principles, Filthineſs, or Excellencie of our natures, is contrary to the pure light and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God. But our God will teach us to avoid their ſlights; they may come near, but ſhall not deceive the Elect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friends,</hi> Let me intreat you, not to be ſo much offended at Lay-mens Preaching, (as you call them) I have travail'd up and down formerly, and have ſeene you much againſt them; I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid there is a remainder of that Spirit ſtill. <hi>Moſes</hi> was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry (though a great Prophet) when ſome would propheſie in the Camp, but honeſtlie ſaid, <hi>I would all the Lords people were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> When the Diſciples ſaw ſome caſting out Devils, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not them, they forbad them: Chriſt hearing it, very meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replies, <hi>forbid them not;</hi> of a truth, there is a more clear ſight and enjoyment of ſpirituall things among them, than with you. But I ſpare you, chuſing rather to go backward, covering your infirmities, than forward, to lay them open. Yet, <hi>my Friends,</hi> if it be poſſible, let me beg one thing at your hands, even for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſake: Conſider the poore husbandmen, who ſuffer much by your way of maintenance. What if you ſhould Preach the Goſpel, and truſt God for a living? The Apoſties did ſo, the people wereas cruell to them, as theſe can be to you, yet they lived in the world, ſhould not you? Miſtake me not, I think you ought to live on the Miniſtrie, if you be truly called
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54588:16"/>
thereto by God, But your barganing with people, ſo much you will have, or not preach, is a practiſe I underſtand not, if you do by the pure light of God, it is well.</p>
               <p>Friends, the Bridegroom is coming, mind his beloved ones you meet withall of it: he comes as a thief in the night, Bleſſed are they that wait for him. Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly: and let thoſe that love his appearing ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Finis.</p>

               <head>An apology to the true Iſrael of GOD.</head>
               <p>MY dear Friends, you have been very precious in my ſight, formerly, though I, a poore weak creature, have wanted power ſo to walk as to adornthe glorious goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, which hath cauſed me where I have loved, ſcarce to own God or you, for ſear of bringing contempt, and deſpiſing to both; no injoyment ſatisfying me, but even to be declared the Son of God with power, as Chriſt was, which yet I wait for more, and more, God hath diſpoſed of me now a little to bring my ſelf forth by writing: the words uſed to great ones, to idle Shepherds, to many in the gathered Churches, may ſeem harſh to you, and grieve your ſpirits, thinking them to be contrary to the meekneſſe &amp; gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo be grieved and made ſad; but ſhall I adde Sorrow to you, now my bowells are moſt yearning over you, and not able to ſpeak any thing againſt you, but all I can for you, In bleſſings ſpirituall and temporall, to prevent your grief if it be poſſible; conſider firſt, what is judged here of ſuch a Generation, as have been, and are enemies to God, its in the wombe with you, its here brought forth: you had by the light of Chriſt ſpelt it, heres onely the pronounciation of the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54588:17"/>
Secondly, conſider Ieſus Chriſt is the Lion of the Tribe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, as well as the Lamb ſlain from the beginning, both theſe he uſed on earth, he was meek, gentle, not quenching ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flax, nor breaking broken Reeds, yet was able to appeare otherwiſe, if need were, as you may ſee at large <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. which life he doth, and will bring forth in his Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thoſe raiſed expreſſions, and actions the Saints uſed, and ſhall act, did not, nor ſhall ariſe from a power or principall of darkneſſe, but from the power and puritie of God in them, read 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 6, 7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>Iſrael, I believe the Saints ſhall be more terrible to the world then ever they have been, and reward them according to their works, not in, or by a baſe power, but a pure one, rule, judge, inflict puniſhments, they ſhall, but in righteouſneſſe and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereas the world hath ruled over, judged, and inflicted puniſhments on Iſrael by a beaſtly, and fleſhly power, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which the time is coming, and who knows how ſoon, but ſuch a power then, ſhall not be found in Iſrael, but deſtroyed by the exaltation of Ieſus in them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly conſider, hath not this generation of men ſpoken ſo too, been as <hi>Goliah,</hi> deſpiſers of the hoſt of Iſrael, not beccauſe they were filthy, but for the breaking forth of ſome Beams of the glory of God, and thereby defied God himſelf, moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath and will defie them more and more, and that the breaking forth of himſelf in his people, in this I have endevoured to remove that ſight of trouble I ſaw might befall your ſpirits. And Iſrael, through the goodneſſe of God, you may in this book ſee a glimpſe of a feaſt prepared for Iſrael, ſome have had a taſte of it, how ſoon you may, I know not, ſee it, long for it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as <hi>Abraham,</hi> youl ſay I may do it, and not taſte of it my ſelf, well you have been, and ſtill are precious in my ſight, the Lord doe with me as ſeemeth good in his ſight, let me have your prayers who am unworthy of mercie,</p>
