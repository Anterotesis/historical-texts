            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The naturall inclination and diſpoſition of man, by the gift of other humane Sciences, is onelie bettered and made more prompt.

For what auaileth it vnto a man to bee a cunning Aſtrologian, a learned Lawyer, rich and mightie, yea, a Monarch of the whole world, and in the meane time haue no ioy, nor pleaſure thereof, by reaſon that he is daily vexed with cruell paine, and deadly torments of maladies, ready euery howre to giue vp the ghoſt?

            <p>Heereof it proceedeth, that <hi>Aeſculapius, Apollo,</hi> and other inuentors of our Art, haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (for the excellencie of that Science) beene deified and eſteemed for Gods, meaning thereby, that like as diuine Authors doe farte exceede worldly inuentors, ſo this Art found out by the Gods, is worthy to be preferred by man, to all other worldly Sciences. For this cauſe the Greeke Poet <hi>Homer,</hi> doth prefer the profeſſors of this Art, to all other profeſſors, how excellent ſoeuer they be. Heere vpon, I being mooued by the former reaſons, &amp; loue that I beare to the Common-wealth, I intend to intreate of a diſeaſe, whoſe cure pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Arte of Chirurgerie, commonlie called the diſeaſe of Spaine or Naples.

Therefore, he that would preſcribe an eaſie, perfect, and true way to oute this diſeaſe, ſhould greatly benefit the Publique weale, in preſeruing the life of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of people, who vndeſeruedly, by infection from others, are greeuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, with this deteſtable maladie.

For to refraine the filthy luſts of men and women, God hath permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thys ſicknes to raigne among them, as a puniſhment for ſinne: like as we ſee in the 6. of Exodus, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded <hi>Moſes</hi> to caſt powder in the ayre, in the preſence of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,</hi> to the effect, the beaſts and people of Egipt, ſhould be puniſhed and afflicted with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtums and Vlcers, for their ſinnes and diſobedience. But becauſe I will not intermedle holy things with prophane, I will not inſiſt further in this matter. The Aſtrologians are of opinion, that it commeth and hath the originall from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> influence of the ſtarres, and eclipſes of the Sunne: as chaunced at that time, in the Ile of <hi>Calecute,</hi> when and where it began. There are others that think it to be ingendered of a Fornicator and a Lepre, in the Weſt Indies, Anno Dom. 1490. The moſt probable of all, is the opinion of the Spaniſh Hiſtoriographers, and alſo diuers other learned men that haue written of the ſame: vvho doe report, that it was brought among the Chriſtians, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natiuitie of our Lord, 1492. by a Spaniard called <hi>Christophorus Columbus,</hi> with many other Spanyards, accompanied with ſome women, who came from the new found Iles occidentalls. For this ſicknes is as common, or rather rifer amongſt them, then any other diſeaſe with vs, and doth infect, as contagious ſickneſſes doe among vs. So diuers Souldiers were infected, who after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, not onely infected their owne Country, but alſo diuers others. Anno 1493. in the Moneth of December, (as <hi>Nicholaus Leonitius</hi> reporteth, writing of thys diſeaſe) when K. <hi>Charles</hi> the viij. of Fraunce beſieged Naples with a puiſſant Armie, where hee remained certaine Moneths, ſome of the Spanyards came to him, of the which <hi>Chriſtophorus Columbus</hi> was chiefe, and ſpred this pernitious ſeed, and termed it the Indian ſicknes, which, hath had his courſe ſince, not onely amongſt the Spanyards, who call it the Italian ſicknes, but alſo among the Italians, who call it the maladie of Naples, not without cauſe: for it began firſt to floriſh in Naples. Amongſt the Frenchmen it is called the Spaniſh ſickneſſe, in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the great pocks, in Scotland the Spaniſh Fleas, and that for two cauſes, the one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:10476:4"/>
it began firſt amongſt the Spanyards: the other, becauſe when the infection ſpreadeth firſt forth in the body, it is like vnto red ſpots, called flea-bitings. Some call it the vnder foote, becauſe that infection often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by treading with the bare foote vpon the ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the diſeaſed with this contagion. There are ſome ignorant malicious people, who call it the French ſicknes, without any cauſe or reaſon. The moſt part call it the Venerian ſicknes, becauſe moſt commonly, it proceedeth of the act of <hi>Venus.</hi> Some call it <hi>Puden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagra,</hi> becauſe in many people it breedeth firſt in thoſe parts in both ſexes. Now it may be called generall ſicknes, becauſe it is generally ſpred throughout all the world: but for that theſe things, concerning the originall and names, are not greatly materiall, I wil paſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer, and onely ſhew thoſe things that are moſt neceſſarie for the true curing of this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; declaring firſt the cauſe. For not knowing the cauſe, it is impoſſible to find out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedies for the cure, ſeeing in all diſeaſes, the cauſe muſt firſt be taken away, or elſe the true cure cannot enſue.</p>

               <p>HAuing intreated of the definition and originall of this maladie, nowe it followeth to ſhew the cauſes of the ſame, which are eyther externall or internall. The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall conſiſt not onely in things manifeſt, but alſo in occult and hidden thinges, which lye as you haue heard in the former Chapter. Heere we will content vs to ſay onely, that this maladie proceedeth cheefely from the act of <hi>Venus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men haue to doe with women polluted with that infection, though ſometimes it be but ſmall. For by reaſon that the compoſition of the ſecret parts of both ſexe, are compoſed of rare fleſh, and ſpongious, it happeneth by the frication they are eaſily heated and rarified, and ſo the ſooner infected. And for thys cauſe, thoſe that doe the act ſoone, are not ſo eaſilie infected, as thoſe who are long in dooing, by reaſon that the long heate dooth extenuate thoſe parts. Likewiſe they which haue the skin fleane of their ſecret parts, take not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the maladie as others, becauſe beeing alwaies vncouered, it is not ſo tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and therefore not ſo apt to receiue infection. It proceeds alſo by lying in vncleane lynnen, by wearing the garments of them which are infected, and by lying with ſuch as haue any ſpyces of it. So that we ſee many by that meanes infected, without any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of women. Moreouer, it proceedes alſo by ſucking the Nurſe any way diſeaſed with this ſicknes, by drinking after them which haue Vlcers in their throat, by kiſſing or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the breath of ſuch as are infected, and by ſitting on the priuie after them, &amp; ſometimes by treading bare-footed on the ſpettle of thoſe which haue beene long corrupted. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon I will ſette downe mine owne experience, as followeth. I ſaw, Anno 1589. in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier <hi>Coiutret</hi> his houſe, Principall of the facultie of Chirurgery in Paris, the number of 26. men, women, and children, infected, which were ſent vnto him by the Iuſtice, to diſcouer from whence came the originall of it, becauſe it was thought, that one infant did infect all the reſt: Whoſe Parents and Nurſe being both cleane, made the cauſe more difficult to be found out. Yet by diligent enquirie, the infection was found to haue his beginning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Midwife, who of a long time had been infected with that diſeaſe, and by receiuing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child, infected it, by firſt breathing vpon the ſame, as beeing tender &amp; delicate, ſo the more eaſie to receiue ſuch infection. Thereafter ſucking the Nurſe, did infect her, and ſundry other Nurſes, one after another, who by giuing ſuck to other chyldren, did infect them, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the children did infect their Parents. So it was prooued, that by that chylde, there were infected to the number of threeſcore, leſſe and more: which perſons I ſaw, &amp; cured the moſt part of them my ſelfe. I haue knowne diuers to haue been infected onely by kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, of which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I haue healed one in Paris, who was infected by kiſſing a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman a ſutor of hers, who had Vlcers in his throat, proceeding from the ſame diſeaſe, in ſuch ſort, that ſhortly after all her hayre did fall, with externall paine of the ioynts, whom I healed, with the help of God and my confection. The ſaid Gentlewoman afore her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to me, dyd infect ſundry chyldren, by lying, kiſſing, and drinking with them. Some infected onely by drinking with thoſe that were infected afore, as you haue heard: ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:10476:5"/>
it behoues vs to refraine familiar frequentation with ſuch people. I cured alſo a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Paris, of a great Family, a virgin (as I found by my viſitation) which was infected with thys diſeaſe: the cauſe whereof I found to haue come by ſitting on a Priuie after an infected perſon. Likewiſe I healed a boy in Paris of the age of 15. yeeres, who was infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by going bare-foote vpon his Maſters ſpettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gallen</hi> ſayth, <hi>Lib. de Febribus, cap. tertio,</hi> that it is daungerous to accompany thoſe that be in a conſumption and ſtincking breath'd, and thoſe that bee infected with the Plague, Leproſie, and ſuch other ſicknes which come by contagion, as thys doth. Many others I haue ſeene, which for briefenes I will omit. Now let vs come to the internall cauſe of this malady, which is corrupted meats, that doe ingender a putred flegmaticke nurature, or a burnt mellancholy; as diuers ſorts of hearbs, roots, fiſhes, fruites, with ſuch lyke rotten foode, where-with the French Army was nouriſhed at Naples, where thys malady began firſt to be knowne among Chriſtians. Yet will I not affirme, that the flegmatick or mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick humor is the onely cauſe of thys diſeaſe, but alſo other humors: yet the neerer that mens complexions approch to the flegmatick, the apter they are to receiue thys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which ought to be obſerued. For we ſee fewer Chollerick or Sanguins infected with thys dyſeaſe then the Mellancholick or Flegmatick: likewiſe more difficult to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as we finde ordinarily by our experience. VVherein we muſt note, that after the Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick complexion, followeth the Mellancholick, next the Sanguine, laſt of all the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, the which in deed is leaſt altered, becauſe among all the humors, it ſimbolizeth leaſt with the ſayd Pituitous humor, The humor ſo altered and corrupted, dooth actually let the action, eyther animall, vitall, or naturall: or two of them together, or all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three, as well generally throughout all the body, as particularly in one member, as ordinarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in ſuch dyſeaſes. Some are of opinion, that it commeth of the imbecilitie of the vitall ſpirits, and naturall, like as ſomtyme wee ſee by experience. I knew, (when I vvas Chirurgian ordinary to the French and Spaniſh Regiment in Paris,) that 35. ſouldiers had carnally to doe wyth a woman infected, yet of the ſayde 35. onely ſeauen were infected with the fore-ſaid woman; which ſeauen were cold and weake men of complexion, and long in performing that act: the reſt were hote and robuſt, ſoone diſpatching the act, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the faculty ſtrong to withſtand the venim; and for this reaſon they were not inſected therewith. Diuers ſuch accidents haue I known. <hi>Fallopius</hi> is of the opynion, that the cauſe of thys infection, commeth often of the paſſion of the minde: for when a woman loueth not that man ſhee hath to doe with, ſhe heateth not her ſelfe, but lieth quietly, and ſo thruſteth not forth the venim, as ſome whores doe. In this I thinke it a manifeſt occaſion, that ſome bunglers and olde men, are not ſo commonly infected, as ſome young men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they haue all to doe with one woman: becauſe alſo old men are dry, hauing the skin hard, the Gland therefore not ſo eaſie to receiue venim, as yee haue heard. In lyk manner women very common, gyue not ſo eaſily thys euill, as other women, who are leſſe infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not ſo common. The cauſe is, that common women take not ſo great pleaſure, becauſe they beeing accuſtomed night and day to exerciſe venerie, doe not excitat the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ſo much as the other, who take greater pleaſure therein, by reaſon that they vſe not the act ſo often. I haue often knowne men infected therewith, who haue beene extreamly well loued of the woman, by reaſon ſhe tooke pleaſure with him, and ſo the vertue expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixe was the ſtronger to put forth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was venomous, to the great hurt of the man. All theſe occaſions doe infect many, which infection, if it remaine any ſpace in the body, ſheweth certaine ſignes, as ye ſhall heare in the Chapter of ſignes.</p>

               <p>THE originall, and cauſe of this diſeaſe beeing knowne, it followeth to intreate of the differences of the ſame: touching the which we muſt vnderſtand, that it is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time gentle, and moleſteth nothing, other whiles by little infection it doth ſodainly augment, and come to the ſtate of the maladie: ſomtime they paſſe many moneths and yeares, before it be knowne, eyther to the infected or to the Chirurgian, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb facs="tcp:10476:5"/>
it occupieth onely the liuer, and conſequently the vaines, ſomtime it is ſpread ouer all the body, ſo that the hart and braines are ſomtime vexed with great accidents, according to the varietie of the venim, and of the body wherein it happeneth, ſometime with great ſimptoms, ſomtime ſmall. That, which occupieth the haire of the head, beard, &amp; browes, without any feeling and hurting of the body, is the moſt ſimple ſort. The ſecond kind is worſe, which occupieth the skin with little ſpots, which waxe greater, ſomtime red, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time yellow, which cannot be well extinguiſhed, except that the roote of the ſicknes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. The third kind is greater, the which not onely maketh little ſpots, but alſo Puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulles, and Tubercules, firſt, in the temples, forehead, and head, thereafter through the whole body, theſe are round and dry without matter Purulent, yet in time, if they be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, they increaſe, and become vlcers Virulens, and ſordides chiefely about the throat, noſe, and fundament, becauſe theſe places are more tender, and therefore ſo much the more eaſie to be vlcered. The fourth kind is that which is infixed in the ioynts and naturall parts, which makes great dolour, ſomtime ſpaſme and contraction of one member, or of diuers members together. The fifth kind is that which makes ſuch relaxation, that para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize followes in one member, or generally taketh away the motion of the whole body. The ſixth kind, is when it is inueterated, ſo that it poſſeſſeth and corrupteth the ſolide and firme parts, as bones, ſinewes, membrans, and tendons. The ſeauenth kind is that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth diſlocation of one, or diuers articles. The eight kind is that which maketh ſuch corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; fracture in the midſt of the bones, ſomtime accompanyed with Herpes, and Darters furfurous, of the which ſome appeare in the ſoles of the feete, ſome in the head, ſome in the hands, and ſome through all the body. The ninth kind is that which occupieth diuers parts of ths head with extreame paine, but chiefely in the night, ſomtime with alteration of the ſcull. The tenth kind is that which cauſeth deafenes with difficultie of ſmelling, and alſo ablation of the fiue ſences naturals. The eleauenth cauſeth leproſie, which is incurable. The twelueth kind is, when the ſicke becommeth Ethick, &amp; dyes in a conſumption. There are a number of others differences of this diſeaſe: <hi>Antonius Muſa</hi> ſayth, that there are two hundreth thirtie and foure kinds, but theſe which I haue ſet downe, are the moſt common, vnder the which all the reſt are comprehended. Furthermore, we muſt vnderſtand, that when this diſeaſe doth degenerate into leproſie, it happeneth in thoſe, who often times haue been vndiſcreetly handled by ignorant perſons, and when the body is ill prepared, eyther by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancie of lyſe or otherwiſe. VVhen it doth degenerate into a conſuming Feauer and doth become Ethick, which the Latines call <hi>Tabid,</hi> and that it is neere the noble parts, it happeneth in thoſe that haue beene often handled onely by Sudorfficks, and dry nouriture, as many ignorant perſons doe, thinking to drie vp the euill humors that way, and ſo drie vp the humor radicall, which of neceſſitie cauſeth the patient to become Ethick.</p>

               <p>THE ſignes of this diſeaſe doe commonly follow the temperature of the body diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. As if a perſon of the Sanguine temperature be infected, ſuch a one ſhall haue ordinarily paine and heauines in the head, but chiefely in the forehead, and rootes of the eyes, in the necke, and ſhoulders, in the arme, and often times in all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, great pulſation in the temples, appetite to vomit, with dulnes of the fiue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſences, laſſitude of all the body, chiefely, when the partie ſleepeth, and after ſleepe the mouth clammie, the vaines of the eyes red, vlcers ſordids both in the ſecrets and other parts of the body, with inflamation and rednes diuers puſtulles in the head, face, and neck, and ſomtimes through all the body, (which for the moſt part are red, and inflamed) great aboundance, of ſweat, very ill ſauours, the vrine very red and thicke, great paine at ſuch time, as the humor Sanguine raigneth, which is from three in the morning, till nine, as ye may ſee in our Chirurgie in the Chapter of humors. If he, who is infected with this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, be of the humor bilious or Chollerick, he ſhall haue great drought with want of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, punctions throgh all his body like poynts of needles, paine in the right ſide of the head, the body becommeth leane, the face and eyes euill coloured, the mouth euill taſted, falling
<pb facs="tcp:10476:6"/>
of haire through all the body, with aboundance of drie puſtulles, which are more plentifull in theſe two humors, than in the other two, by reaſon, that theſe humors be more liquid, and ſo paſſe more eaſilie from the centre to the circumference of the body. He hath vlcers virulent in diuers parts of the body, chiefely in the yard, codds, and roofe of the mouth and throat, great paine at ſuch time as the humor chollerick raigneth, which is from nine in the morning, till three in the after-noone. If the patient be of temperature pituitous, or phlegmatick, he ſhall haue paine with heauines of the hinder part of the head, neck, armes, and legs, in all the articles, and ioynts, dimnes of ſight, little appetite, little drought, great coldnes in the head and ſtomack, debilitie of the parts neruous, trembling palſie, vvith attraction of ſome parts of the body, the mouth homide and clammie, the face and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſwelled, great aboundance of white puſtuls without itch, ſo that the phlegme be not ſalt. If the phlegme be ſalt, there happen Serpins and impetigines, which we call common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Dortors furfurons, or cruſtous chiefely in the hands, and ſoles of the feete, and in the head, and ſomtimes in all the parts of the body: alſo great vlcers euill coloured, large, and hard round about, oftentimes Tophes and Nodoſities on the bones, great paine at ſuch time, as the humor raigneth, which is from three in the after-noone vntill nine. If the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be of the humor mellancholike, eyther by nature, or accident, he ſhall haue paine in the left ſide of the head, alſo in his ſhoulders heauines in all the body, debilitie of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. The body becommeth leane, or at the leaſt ſome part of it, all the body is euill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, but chiefely thoſe parts which are moſt infected with it, vnſauorie taſt in the mouth, falling of haire, the puſtls be hard and deepe but fewe in numher, many vlcers, and Canchors in diuers parts, ſwelling of the bones in the head, but eſpecially in the forehead, hemerands, deficultie of vrine, with aſtrection of the belly, the ſleepe is intercepted with great dolour, at ſuch time as the humor gouerns, which is from nine at night, vntill three at morning. Theſe be the ſignes ſimple, and particulerly for the knowledge of this ſicknes according to euery humor: to the end that euery one may haue better &amp; more eaſie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this diſeaſe, I will ſet downe certaine generall ſignes, by the which ye may knowe the perſon to be infected, oft what complexion ſo euer he be. The firſt, and moſt common is hard vlcers in the ſecret parts of both ſex, ſwellings in the flanke called vſually Bubons or Apoſtumes virulens, running of the raines, voyding an infected humor, which proceeds from the kernels, called by the Latines <hi>Proſtata</hi> and <hi>Paraſtata,</hi> dolours of the head, legs, armes, and ſhoulders, chieſely in the ioynts, accompanied with ſwelling and hardnes, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning along the Muskels, Nerues, Tendons, Perioſte, and other parts Neruonſe, in ſuch ſort that the ſicke is out of patience, ſo that he can neyther reſt, walke, ſleepe, nor lift his arme to his head. And this happeneth ſomtime in one part, ſomtime in diuers, alſo vlcers in the mouth and throat, with difficultie of ſwelling, puſtules about the forehead, which we call commonly the golden crowne, likewiſe in the rootes of the haire, and all ouer the head. More-ouer, in the Emunſtoires of the noble parts, as alſo other parts glandulous, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, and ſomtime ouer the whole body, falling of the haire of the head, beard, browes, and eye-lids, defluxion on the eyes, corruption of the teeth, and the pallet of the mouth. Somtime the whole vnula is conſumed, ſo that the diſeaſed ſpeake alway in the noſe, and and ſometime there is diſtention of the Perioſt, which is the membran that couers the bones vniuerſally. Furthermore, ſomtime the patient is drouſie, yet cannot ſleepe, chiefely at ſuch time of the night when the humor is in motion, the which happeneth rather at that time then at any other, for two cauſes, the firſt, becauſe the humor is moſt commonlie cold as the night is, the ſecond becauſe the poares are cloſed in the night, ſo that the euill humor doth not voyd, which by the opening of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poares in the day doe purge. Yet al theſe ſignes doe not happen to euery diſeaſed perſon, nor yet in this order as you haue heard, for ſome appeare in one part, ſome in others, and in diuers perſons ſooner then in others, which falleth out according to the temperature of the diſeaſed. Often times there is but a fewe of theſe tokens found together, and therefore it behoueth to haue good iudgement. As for example, if there be vlcers in the yeard, being hard at the roote, and not demini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing by any application of particuler remedies, the malady is to be ſuſpected. Likewiſe
<pb facs="tcp:10476:6"/>
the running of the raines, and heate of vrine, accompanied with diuers accidents, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler convulſion, chiefely in the night, where there is erection of the yeard. More-ouer, vlcers in the necke of the bladder, in all the which if ordinary remedies doe not extinguiſh the venim, they are to be ſuſpected, as alſo tumors in the flanke, called Bubones which if they ſticke inward without breaking forth, they are euill. And in all theſe things I find no ſure remedie, but from the particuler cure, to the generall. Yet ſomtime men may haue this diſeaſe not hauing any of theſe tokens aboue mentioned, ſauing only little vlcers of a ſmall breadth, ſomtimes on the thighs, or on the codds, likewiſe women in the paps, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the fundament. Therefore in all theſe things there is required a good iudgement, to conſider the qualities and nature of ſuch vlcers, and to dreſſe them after the mnaner, which yee ſhall vnderſtand heereafter.</p>

               <p>HAuing ſpoken of the tokens preſent and paſt of this diſeaſe, we muſt likewiſe ſpeake of the Future, to the effect that we may iudge of the cure, in what time it may be helpt, or whether it be incurable. Firſt then, wee muſt conſider that eyther the ſicknes is recent, or inueterate: if it be recent with fewe ſimptomes externall, as Puſtulles, falling of the haire, ſome vlcers in the ſecret parts, accompanied with great paine on the ſhoulders and articles. In this caſe, if the perſon be young, of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the time conuenient, like as in ſpring-time, or Sommer, then thou mayſt prognoſtick that the true cure may eaſily follow, by vſing of ſuch familier and eaſie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as ye ſhall heare in the cure. But if of long time, for great dolor, the members be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, except that great remedies be vſed with great diſcretion, they remaine ſo. If it be old, inueterate with many ſimtomes, like as great dolors of all ſorts, as in the head, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and articles, Tophes and Nodoſities, with corruption of the bones, and vlcers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne in diuers parts, the bodie extenuate and imbecill, and of euill temperature, full of euill humors, and ſcabbs of diuers ſorts, like vnto leproſie, and hath beene often cured, which happeneth through the ignorance of them, who take vpon them to cure the ſame, vſing onely one remedie, which is rubbing with quick ſiluer, for all the kinds of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, thou ſhalt prognoſtick that the curation will be hard and long. This ſomtime happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth alſo by learned Chirurgians, who haue done their indeuour, yet the infection being ſo great, and occupying the vaines which be neere the lyuer, and the lyuer it ſelfe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble parts, the ioynts and other parts ſpermatick, that hardly it will obey any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and in this poynt thou ſhalt alſo prognoſtick, that the curation will be hard and long. Thoſe that eate and drinke much, lyuing without dyet and obſeruation of the vnnaturall things, albeit they be young, and of good temperature, yet they are as hardly cured as thoſe that are weake, drie, and conſumed with other ſickneſſes, and are healed with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or elſe not at all. If the places and veſſels neere the hart be occupied, as I haue noted in ſundrie patients, and after that remedies be vſed, the ſicke become Ethick, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, then thou ſhalt iudge it to be incurable, and in that caſe thou ſhalt vſe no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but Palliatiue, as in the Elephanticks, leproſies, and diuers other ſuch like diſcaſes. Neuertheleſſe, be diſcreete in giuing thy iudgement, for I haue cured Spaniards and French, both men and women, of diuers temperatures, who had often been treated both in Spaine, Lowe Countries, and Fraunce, accompanied with many greeuous Simptomes, Nodoſities in diuers parts of the body, vlcers in the mouth, and throat, ſo that the roofe of the mouth was falling, as alſo the pype which wee call <hi>Plectrum Vocis,</hi> the noſe, accompanied with diuers ſickneſſes on the eyes, greeuous torments, and all kind of dolors, which may be reckoned to be moſt intollerable, the articles all ſwelled, chiefely the knees, great paine in the extremities with vniuerſall extenuation, ſo that the parties become altogether Ethick. Although theſe haue beene ſeemed incurable, yet by vſing certaine medicines, but chiefely my confection, I haue healed them, contratie to many mens expectation. Truly the cure is difficill, <hi>Quoniam eſt eronica et cum malignitate coniuncta,</hi> but thoſe, who mend, become fat, albeit they were leane before, becauſe the blood is more purified, by the medicaments and

               <head>The ſeauenth Chapter of the nature of medicines moſt commonly vſed for the Spaniſh ſicknes, and firſt of Gaiac.</head>
               <p>THere are diuers remedies, which haue beene vſed by our Auncients, and approued very good, which we vſe at thys preſent for the curation of this diſeaſe, alwaies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſifying them, according to the temperature, the time and varietie of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; which albeit they be diuers, yet heere we will onely ſpeake of thoſe which are moſt common, and neceſſary for the curation hereof, beginning at the Gaiac tree, which we call <hi>Lignum ſanctum. Conſolanus</hi> a Spaniſh Hiſtoriographer ſayth, that in the occidentall Indies, in an Ile called S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> thys tree groweth to a great height, moſt lyke the Walnut tree: the leafe thick and broade, bearing a fruite round and hard, &amp; of a reaſonable greatnes, which is eaten of chyldren, and thought to be very wholſome for thoſe that are of a weake complexion. <hi>Iohannis Leonis Africanus,</hi> ſayth, that it beareth a certaine flower and ſeede, but becauſe we ſee none of it in thys Countrie, and it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for our purpoſe, we will ſpeake no more at this preſent of that matter, but will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate onely of the tree it ſelfe. It is to be knowne, that of this tree there are three kindes, as ſaith <hi>Ioh. Monardus,</hi> in his 17. booke <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. The firſt is that which hath the fruite very great, and black within, interlaced with little vaines, of the which there is great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the Ile of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> The ſecond kind is not ſo great, neither hath it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart ſo black, yet it hath like rayes as the other. <hi>Conſolanus</hi> ſayth, that thys hath great vertue in diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſickneſſes, as Gouts, Sciaticks, paynes of ioynts, Catarrhes, Epilepticks, Pulmonicks, Hydropicks, and diuers diſeaſes of the kidneys and bladder, and generally for all cold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The third kind is ſmaller then eyther of the precedents, and is all white both within &amp; without: the vaines in it are ſmaller then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others, as ſaith <hi>Sueſſanus Neapolitanus.</hi> That which is of the beſt ſort is of a meane greatnes, recent, dry, &amp; vncorrupted; which beeing put in the fire, the ſubſtance doth appeare gummie, the collour yellow, with a meane pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes within, the barck cleauing hard to the tree. In the choyce of the tree you muſt obſerue theſe properties. In like manner there are three ſubſtances to bee obſerued in the tree, the firſt is the skin or barke, which drieth much, the ſecond is the rinde, and is white in culler, &amp; not ſo drying, being more gummy: the third is the blacke within, called the hart, and hath more gummy humiditie, and leſſe drying; and that we vſe in delicate bodies and of rare texture, where there is no need of much drying. The ſecond we vſe in them that are weak, and the third, which is the barck, in ſtrong perſons, as the moſt drying. The greateſt is meeteſt for our vſe, which groweth in an Ile of <hi>Hiſpaniola noua,</hi> called <hi>Inſula beata,</hi> or <hi>Diui Iohannis,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Gartius Abortus,</hi> and hath great vertue for many diſeaſes. It diſſolueth &amp; maketh thin, it mundifieth, it prouoketh ſweat, it ſtayeth vrin, it dryeth and corroborateth the ventricle, and all the reſt of the entralls, it conſumeth the ſtinck of the mouth, it is good for the euill temprature of the lyuer, and cold, that commeth eyther of colde drinck or meate; it is good for obſtructions and Hydropſies. It diſpatcheth the ſuperfluous &amp; colde humors of the body: it is good for Catarrhes of the head, all kinds of Goute, all diſeaſes of the Nerues, all Vlcers, and moſt excellent for many kinds of the Spaniſh ſicknes by reaſon of the ſecret vertue which is in it.</p>

               <p>IFinde great diuerſitie of opinions amongſt the Auncients, touching Quickſiluer, for the moſt part eſteeme it to be cold and humide. <hi>Auicen</hi> in his ſecond canon, noteth it to be cold and moyſt in the ſecond degree. <hi>Gulielmus Placentinus, Arnaldus de villa nouae,</hi> and <hi>Placarius,</hi> thinks it to be cold in the fourth degree, which may eaſily be perceiued, for it is troth that it repelleth the humor from the circumference to the centre, &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by the great coldnes hereof, Palſie and trembling, and the members to be inflexible, as ſayth <hi>Plinie, Dioſcorides,</hi> and <hi>Palmarius. Auicen</hi> ſaith, that it cauſeth a ſtincking breath, with dimnes of the ſight, falling of the teeth, which we ſee to be true in ſuch as haue thys ſicknes, and haue often been rubbed therewith. Some eſteeme it to bee hote and dry, but few approued Authors are of that opinion. There are two kinds of it, naturall and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, the naturall is found in the vaines and denns of the earth, as ſayth <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides,</hi> and is called by them, <hi>Hydargirus.</hi> It is found alſo amongſt Mettals, as reporteth <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcarides</hi> in his firſt booke. The artificiall is made of Minium, and ſcrapings of Marble, as writeth <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in his ſeauenth booke of his Architecture. Some of it is found &amp; drawn out of Lead, and is eaſily knowne from the other, being of cullor browne, and black, and of ſubſtance thick, leauing ſome reſt behind, like the excrements of Leade, which is not meete forthys purpoſe. That which is cleane white and ſubtile is good. Neuertheleſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing choſen the moſt proper for our vſe, it muſt be yet prepared and purified after this ſort folowing. Firſt you ſhal take ſo much of it as you will vſe, and boyle it 6. or 7. howres in water, putting in ſuch things with it as haue the vertue to coroborate &amp; comfort the parts netuouſe, as alſo to purifie it, like as Sage, Roſemary, Camomell, Melilot, Tyme, with other
<pb facs="tcp:10476:8"/>
neruall hearbs. That being done, ſtraine it through a cloth, then after extinguiſh it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the maner which you ſhall heare hereafter; and incorporate it with a little Swines greace. Being well compounded, you muſt melt it on the fire, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking it of, you ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Quickſiluer ſeperated from the greace: the excrement and leaden ſubſtance ſhall remaine in the ſame greace: Hauing ſo done, you ſhall ſtrayne it through a peece of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the end that it may be very pure, then after, extinguiſh it againe, to the effect that you may the better incorporate it with other Swines greace, or with ſuch medicaments as you ſhall heare. If you will haue your oyntment white, and neither blacke nor gray, you muſt make it after thys order inſuing. Take your Quickſiluer and beate it in a morter with Vinegar and ſalt, then poure out that Vinegar and ſalt, and put in new, and ſo beat it with 3. or 4. ſundry ſhyftings, and ſo your oyntment ſhall be white. But to extinguiſh the ſame, you muſt put into the morter with it a little ſyrop of Roſes, or oyle of Petroly, or iuyce of Lemmons, or faſting ſpittle, or a little oyntment wherein Quickſiluer hath beene put, for that is the beſt, and will ſooneſt extinguiſh it. Then beate them together, till ſuch time as there be not any apparence of the Quickſiluer, leaſt that beeing not well extinguiſhed, it ſhould returne to the old forme. So being well quenched, as is requiſite, you ſhall make your oyntment (hauing likewiſe prepared the Swines greace) in thys manner. Melt it on the fire, and boyle it with the hearbs before mentioned, or with others of like vertue, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all chopped ſmall: then all being boyled together, you ſhall ſtraine it through a cloth, and mingle with it a little Iris of Florence, which wil take away the ſauour of the greace, then after, compoſe the oyntment thus.</p>

               <p>AS for the curing of thys diſeaſe, it ſhall be requiſite to vſe all the 3. parts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, which are Chirurgery, Dyet, and Pharmacy: firſt of all we muſt obſerue the dyet, which is the forme of life, for as <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayth, the diſordered courſe of life, may corrupt the beſt complexion, &amp; being well gouerned, may correct the worſt. Then let vs begin the cure of thys diſeaſe by good gouernment of lyfe in the ſixe vnnaturall things, which are, the ayre, the meate and drinke, and all that wee vſe for our ſuſtenance, the motion and reſt of our body, vnder the which is comprehended venerie, ſleepe, and waking, the retention, and repletion, the affections of the minde: theſe thinges muſt be obſerued, for without the obſeruation of them, it will be hard to cure this ſicknes. The ayre muſt be cleane, pure, and temperat. The meate ought to bee nouriſhing, and of eaſie digeſtion, that neither ingenders thicke nor ſharpe humors. It muſt be more dry then moyſt, abſtayning from fiſh, ſalt fleſh, all kinde of ſpyces and fruites, becauſe theſe ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euill humors. Abſtaine alſo from all manner of Pulſe, as Peaſe and Beanes, alſo from Beefe, Swines fleſh, Goats, Hares, and Rammes fleſh; from all ſort of Water-foule, Ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Colewoort, and all kind of rootes, theſe are hurtfull, and breede euill blood. Eate onely Mutton, Veale, Kid, Chickins, Doue, Partridge, &amp; ſuch like: you may alſo vſe the broth of them. Your bread muſt be of Wheate, eyther Bisket; or at the leaſt well baked. Abſtaine from Wine, for it is an enemy to thys dyſeaſe; vſe onely the decoction of Gaiac, Salſparill, or Chine, according to the temperature of the diſeaſed. Vſe a little exerciſe, for reſt is hurtfull, except there be great payne in the ioynts, or in ſome other part; Let not the exerciſe be violent, for it diſſolueth the naturall heate, ſleepe not long, becauſe it fills the head with vapors. VVe muſt alſo obſerue the paſſions of the minde, chiefely mellancholy.
<pb facs="tcp:10476:8"/>
Be alwaies merry, for then the naturall heate doth preuaile, and ſo helpeth much to the cure. Greefe, feare, and anger, do much hinder the operation of the Medicines. We muſt take heed to the excrements, that the vapors aſcend not to the head and other principal parts. So the Patient muſt haue often Clyſters made after thys manner. <hi>Recipe maluae Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea violarea, et Mercurialis an ma. i. Beulliant ad lib. 1.

There are three other things to be obſerued of the Chirurgian, to wit, the eſſence, the cauſe, and ſymptoms of the maladie, as ye haue heard, the diueſitie of the temperatures, and the fit remedies for curing hereof, for theſe things beeing vnknowne, the true cure hardlie followeth: but onely by hazard and not by rules of Arte, as the blind man caſteth his ſtaffe.</p>

For theſe cauſes wee muſt not meruaile at the malignitie and crueltie of thys ſickneſſe, nor the ſore torments of the ſick; for there are manie euill diſpoſed perſons in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who endanger a great manie Patients, by not vſing of fit remedies, taking one medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for all ſorts of this diſeaſe, which is much againſt reaſon. For according to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature and nature of the parties diſeaſed, the remedie muſt bee changed, as <hi>Gallen</hi> hath written at large in his bookes <hi>De locis affectis.</hi> There are alſo many who profeſſe to knowe ſecrets, and diabolick charmes for curation hereof, but all ſuch things are falſe, &amp; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors there of are worthie to be moſt greeuouſly puniſhed, for ſuch things cauſe the ſicknes to waxe more rebellious, ſo that hardlie afterwards it obeyeth anie remedie, and then the poore Patient dieth moſt miſerably. Theſe things happen by not knowing the nature of the maladie, and remedies, not the varietie of the bodies, and the nature of the partie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. VVee muſt vnderſtand, that ſtrong people, as Labourers, Marriners, and ſuch as are vſed to ſore labour, endure more violent remedies &amp; ſtronger euacuations, then thoſe which are weaker and more delicate, as women, ſick folks, tender children, Eunuches and ſuch like: for ſuch perſons the medicine muſt be gentler, and the euacuations leſſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in vſing of ſtrong remedies, ye put them in danger of death. Heereby it may eaſilie appeare, that according to the temperature we muſt diuerſifie the remedies: for in ſanguine and chollerick complexions, we muſt vſe other medicins then in the phlegmatick and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick.

Therefore I haue taken paines, both by daily practiſe and obſeruation, as alſo by conference with learned men touching this matter, to find a way more certaine for the curation, and not ſo dangerous, nor painfull for the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which may be performed, without keeping eyther bed or chamber, and that without knowledge of any man, except it be inueterate. And it is performed by Pils and decoction of white wine, decoction of Salſparel, by electuarie, &amp; by my Arabick powder, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me haue not beene practiſed: and I may aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I can, by the like meanes, and inuention of mine, cure Children of two moneths old. Now ſeeing, by Gods helpe, I haue found out things ſo profitable for the recouerie of health, in an infinite number of people, I will not hide it, but publiſh the ſame ſo plainly, that euery man by his owne induſtrie, may attaine to the knowledge heereof. But firſt I will ſet downe the common way, daylie practiſed, beginning with the firſt, which is the decoction of Gaiac, and ſo proceede with the reſt, after the ſame order, to the end, that all men may knowe, both the vulgar and auncient way, and alſo the newe, found out and practiſed by mine onely dilligence.</p>

               <head>The 13, Chap. to cure the Spaniſh diſeaſe by decoction of Gaiac, which is the firſt way.</head>
               <p>AS for this manner of cure, that is done onely by decoction, you ſhall heare the forme hereof, after the manner that is ordinarilie vſed, like as I haue often proued my ſelfe. But that I euer healed any onely by that way, I will not ſay, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that there is no Surgion in Fraunce that hath cured that diſeaſe, more then I. Neyther coulde I euer learne of any famous Surgion that would affirme
<pb facs="tcp:10476:9"/>
it to be a true cure. Yet the Spaniards and Italians be of an opinion, that it may be done. Their reaſon is, that the firſt Spaniard that was infected there-with in the occidentall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in an Ile called S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> hauing an Indian to his ſeruant who profeſſed to heale this diſeaſe, onely by that decoction was healed by him, who did alſo heale many others. So by his example diuers others doe vſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way. But I anſwer: At that time the ſicknes was not ſo venimous as now, neyther gaue they it leaſure to inueterat as we doe, nor yet was the people of our temperature, being for that cauſe more eaſie to be healed. Among the foure wayes to heale this diſeaſe, I eſteeme this to be the moſt weake &amp; moſt vncertaine, the which opinion is confirmed by all thoſe that haue written, and practiſed in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neuertheleſſe by our experience we find it a remedie, albeit not altogether ſufficient for the exturpation of this ſicknes, yet a great helpe to it, as alſo to many other diſeaſes, where neede is to heate, attenuat, prouoke ſweat, and drie moderatlie. So that I thinke it ſhould be rather called a preparation to the cure, then a perfect or true cure. For ſeeing it is not ſufficient for the cure of a ſimple ſicknes, as of a defluxion or Catharre, (this we ſee by our daylie practiſe) the which is healed by ſimple remedies, then much more it muſt be weake for the taking away of this ſicknes: the which is of ſuch nature, as ſayth <hi>Palmanius,</hi> that often it receiueth no curation, notwithſtanding the vſe of all proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which make a great euacuation, as well laxatiue as others. Yet I confeſſe, that there is ſome hidden facultie that helpeth much, by reaſon that it heateth, rarifieth, and prouoketh both vrine, and ſweat, and is alſo ſomwhat propper againſt the venim, conſuming a part of the humors that be moſt ſubtill, ſo appeaſeth the dolor for a certaine time, but the primitiue cauſe doth remaine with the moſt part of the humors which be deepe, thicke, and groſſe, of the which commeth Tophes, and Nodoſities, in diuers parts of the body, chiefely in the leggs, armes, and head, accompanied with dolors. Alwayes let it be vſed with a good method &amp; regime, with preparation of the humors, as you haue heard in the generall Chaprer. So doing, the venim is almoſt withdrawne, if the ſicknes be recent and the patient of a good temperature. Therefore I will briefely ſet downe the preparation of this decoction; the time propper to vſe it, and the forme how it ſhall be vſed, with the regime that ſhould be obſerued in the vſage heereof, at all times. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the preparation, after it be put in powder, ſo much as you will vſe, you muſt ſteepe it 24, houres in water, for by the long ſteeping, it receaueth more force, the water muſt be warme, and vpon one pound of the tree, put ten pounds of water, eyther Fountaine, or Riuer, as counſelleth <hi>Montanus</hi> of Hermodact. Drag. ij. That beeing done, it may be made in diuers manners, but the moſt part doe ſeethe it in a weake fire, in a pot of earth or Copper, well couered, ſo that no ayre auoyde: let it ſeethe till the ſecond, or third, or fourth part be conſumed, which ſhall be done according vnto the indication, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the perſon. Some doe make it by diſtillation. But whatſoeuer faſhion you make it of, a little before the full concoction, add ſome Licorice ſmall broken, to the effect it be more pleaſant, ſo retire it from the fire, and being refreſhed, ſtraine it through a cloth, and keepe it cloſe in bottels for thine vſe, the vvhich ſhall be in the morning, at ſuch time as thou wilt ſweat. Therafter thou ſhalt make a ſecond decoction, to drink in the meales, and in other ſuch houres, as ſhall be found to be expedient. It ſhall be made in this forme. Put to the grounds at the reſt of the other decoction, as much water as before, and ſeethe it as the other, but let it not conſume ſo much, by reaſon you ſhall vſe long, and much of it. VVe put to it, for the corroboration of the ſtomack, Coriander, Anniſeed, Cinamon, &amp; ſuch like. The time moſt propper to vſe the firſt decoction, is in the morning and after-noone, long time after meate, taking a greater meaſure in the after-noone, then before noone. If the patient be ſtrong, and the ſicknes great, let the quantitie be greater, and in Winter, more then in Sommer, and in cold folkes, more then in hote folkes. The forme how it ſhall be vſed, is after this manner: that he that vſeth it, muſt be in bed warme, and in a hote ayre, or if the weather be cold, the Chamber muſt alwayes b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:10476:10"/>
after ſweat. It muſt be taken warme, to the end it may doe the office the better, as alſo that by the cold, it hurt not the concoctrix vertue of the ventricle. The quantitie you ſhall giue, is Vnc. viij, or vij, or vj. Hauing ſo taken it, the patient muſt be couered with clothes, which muſt be warme and light. The ſweat muſt not be violent, for by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience we ſee, that albeit it be not violent, yet it weakeneth the body in ſuch a ſort, that we are oft forced to leaue the propper cure, and giue order to the accidents: and the like may happen by the exceſſiue heate of the Chamber, ſo that good iudgement is required in that matter. Somtime for the thicknes of the skin, nature doth not eaſilie prouoke ſweat, for the prouocation wherof it ſhall be well done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to put to the feete and ſhoulders, bottels or bladders full of the ſame decoction, that be very warme. So couer well the head, as alſo the reſt of the body, in ſuch ſort that nothing be vncouered, ſauing onelie the mouth and noſe. Before that you take the potion, it ſhall be well done to make light frictions with hote clothes, chiefely on the parts moſt dolorous, to the end the poares be the eaſier opened, and alſo to prouoke ſweat. After he hath ſweat one houre or two, as hee may eaſily indure, you ſhall drie him with hote clothes, beginning firſt at the parts which be oppoſit to the dolours, next to the parts dolents, and through the reſt of the body: tub well the head, and in time of ſweating, drie oft the face, according as you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it to be moiſt. Being ſo dryed, and the hote clothes taken from him, hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him ſelfe as before, in his bed, keeping him well from the cold, which might cauſe obſtruction of the poares and paſſages, and might bee occaſion to hinder the ſenſible and inſenſible tranſpiration. Two or three houres after he be refreſhed, and the motion ceaſed, he may dine, vſing aliments of good iuice, and according to the regiment hereafter ſet downe. Then foure houres after meat he ſhall take a draught, as before of this decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vſing them as before, and ſo continue 10, or 20, dayes, according vnto the forces of the patient, and nature of the diſeaſe, vſing euery three dayes eyther Gliſters, or ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laxatiue, according vnto the nature of the humor that domaineth. For often by the great ſweats, the belly not being looſe, the excrements doe-drie, and ſo doe much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. Thoſe that vſe to cure by this way, make their decoction ſtronger in the end, to the effect it be more deſiccatiffe, as alſo the regime of life more ſtraight and rigorous, and this way they continue fiue or ſixe weekes, ſweating euery day once or twice, the ſpace of 25. dayes, the reſt of the time they vſe good regime, and drinke no other drinke, for in that time ſay they, albeit he ſweat not, yet the poares that are opened ſhall alwayes vapour out ſome vapours or ſprites venimous, ſo in that time they eſteeme them to be healed. But the truth is, as I haue oft ſeene, that this forme doth nothing, ſaue onely hide the ſicknes, and appeaſe the dolors for a time, ſo that it is alwayes recidiue, and oft times by the long and violent vſage heereof, the humors are rendred more drying, maling, and burned, of the which come miſerable ſimptoms, as I haue often ſeene. In this time the regime is very ſtraight. VVhereof commeth great hurt for the ſtraightnes heereof, ordayning onely ſo much bread, with ſuch a number of plums, as is not ſufficient to entertaine nature: For in long ſickneſſes (as ſayth <hi>Hippocr.</hi> in his 1, Booke, 4, Apho.) that ouer-ſtraightnes of lyfe is alwayes dangerous, ſpeciallie in people that are accuſtomed to eate much. For (as ſayeth the ſame Author) cuſtome is a ſecond nature. Therefore they muſt not be reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo ſoone, nor ſo much from their wonted vſe. In like manner, that ſtraight way of lyfe with the decoction, doth drie and burne the blood, and other good humors, and doth onely conſume a part of the ſubtileſt of the euill humor, and the groſſeſt remaineth. So by this forme of proceeding, the moſt part of the people may not, nor hath not, the force to endure that hard intertainment, albeit it were vailable.</p>
               <p>I haue ſeene ſundry, who by the great vſage of this, are become altogether vncurables. Theſe faults are committed by ſome ſimple Barbers, and other ignorant fellowes, who although they knowe themſelues to be ignorant, yet beeing moſt arrogant, not onely in this, but alſo other ſickneſſes, doe take vpon them to cure and heale euery diſeaſe, hauing their onely recourſe to the dyet, by the which they ruine infinit number of people, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the maladie, the remedies, and the temperature of the patient; not conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:10476:10"/>
the ſicke haue force to ſupport that manner of traitment or no: and alſo whether the humors be prepared, or if they neede prepatation, or if their dyet be propper for the diſeaſe, vſing the ſame remedie in children and old folks. Aske them the reaſon, they will aunſwer you, that they haue cured many, but neyther doe they ſpeake of the reaſon, not of thoſe that they haue killed. God defend all Chriſtians from ſuch a kind of Empirickes. The true regime that we ſhould vſe in this ſicknes, muſt be wiſely done, as well for the nature of the maladie, as for the malice of the accidents. As for the nature of the maladie, the age, the region, the time of the yeare, with diuers other circumſtances, are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. And according vnto these things, the regime of life muſt be obſerued, eyther by adding, or by diminiſhing. In like manner, in theſe Countries that be cold, the naturall heate, retireth to the centre of the body, ſo that the concoction is done the better, and therfore they haue better appetite, as ſayeth <hi>Hippocr.</hi> in his 15, Aphor. &amp; firſt Booke. Alſo <hi>Gallen</hi> in his Commentarie, where he ſayeth. In Winter and Spring-time the ventricle is naturallie hote, and therfore at that time the body ſhould be more nouriſhed. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the lacke of nuriture doth conſume the radicall humiditie, by the action of the ſame heate, therefore our nuriture muſt be of a reaſonable quantitie, and alſo of good iuice, like as Mutton, Veale, Kidds, Capons, Chickins, Feſſants, Partriches, and little Birds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſed, leauing all water Fowles: the which ſhall be ſomtimes roſted, and ſomtimes ſodden, as it ſhall be found expedient. All things muſt be of light digeſtion, and of little excrement. You ſhall abſtaine from plums, for although the decoction hereof be cordiall, the plumme it ſelfe is terreſtre, and melancolick. Alſo abſtaine from meate that ingender groſſe humors and vitious, like as fiſh, the which is of nature pituitous, and full of crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, like as ſalt meate, Spicerie, Onyons, Muſtard, and ſuch like, which may heate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the blood, and lyft vp hote and ſharpe vapours to the head and braines. The bread muſt be of wheat, well baked, for ſo it remayneth longer in the ventricle. It ſhall be well done to put with it the powder of Anniſeede, and Coriander, for the ſtrengthning of the ſtomack. Some men counſaile to vſe onely two or three ounces a day, the which wee obſerue not in our diets: for this our diet is as who would ſay, <hi>Proba victus ratio,</hi> that is, good nuriture, and ſuch a quantitie as agreeth with the temperature of the bodie, with the nature of the ſicknes, and with the time of the yeere, ſo that no man can ſet downe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitlie any diet, vnknowning both the Patient and the diſeaſe. Let him eate ſodden fleſh at dinner, and at ſupper alſo, if he be of a very hote temperature, or els hee ſhall vſe roſted at ſupper, in little quantitie, or in ſtead of that, ſome reaſonable quantitie of Reiſons, the which doe corroborate the entrals. His ordinary drinke ſhall be of the ſecond decoction; compoſed as you haue heard, drinking as much as he thirſteth. If at any time he be weake, and accuſtomed to drink Wine or Ale, he may vſe a little Wine, mingled with the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. He muſt abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſleepe in the after-noone, for it filleth the head with vapours and exhallations, augmenteth the dolors and Catarrhs. Vſe reaſonable exerciſe, &amp; abſtaine from all affections of the minde that troubleth or inflameth the ſpirits and humors. It ſhall be well done to abſtaine altogether fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the act venerian: for it is a chiefe cauſe which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the ſenſible and inſenſible tranſpiration, and euacuation of humors vicious, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokes them to the inward part, and weakeneth much the parts neruous. After thys forme ſometime remaineth intemperature in the liuer, which is for the moſt part hote, &amp; in that we ordaine ſuch things as haue the vertue to refreſh and temper theſe parts. Sometimes it happeneth, that through the great ſweat and much charging of clothes, that the externall parts of the body be verie excrementous, and in that, wee bathe the Patient to clenſe him. For the ſame purpoſe wee vſe the decoction of Chine, the which hath vertue to prouoke ſweat in like manner, and dryeth and maketh fat thoſe that be leane. In making of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, you muſt cut it in ſmall peeces, and take 2. ounces of it and ſteepe it in 8. pynts of warme water, the ſpace of 24, howers, then ſeeth it in an earthen pot till the thyrd part be conſumed, and keepe it cloſe and warme by the fire. Vſe 8, or 10, ounces of it in the morning, and alſo in the after-noone, obſeruing the regime aboue ſpecified, &amp; make in like maner a ſecond decoction of this as of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I vſe to cure by decoction.</p>

               <head>The 14. Chapter ſheweth the way to cure by friction, which is the ſecond way vſed by our Auncients.</head>
               <p>THis way of cure which was moſt commonly vſed by our auncients to all men, is done by frictions and vnctions, the which things are conuenient for ſome people, ſuch things obſerued as you haue heard in the generall Chapter, and that the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent be well compoſed, after the forme of <hi>Ioh. Carpenſis,</hi> who was the firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of vnction with Quickſiluer. Yet was it neither thought by himſelfe, nor by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, meete to be vſed at all times, nor for all ſorts of temperatures and diſpoſitions. For to ſome it weakeneth the entrals and ſolide parts of the body, remaining ſometimes in the body, which cauſeth leanenes, trembling, falling of the teeth, and diuers other accidents. Therefore it muſt be vſed with great iudgment, conſidering well firſt, if the ſick can vſe any other maner of medicine, and if the ſicknes be inueterat, ingendred of groſſe humors and vitious, and adherant to the ſolide parts, the which happeneth moſt commonly to ſuch as haue been oft cured afore; conſidering alſo if there be Nodoſities in the leggs &amp; armes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of dolor in the head &amp; ioynts, the which accidents render the body and vertues hereof weake, by reaſon of the vehement and continuall dolors. When ſuch things doe happen, the friction may be vſed to the inferior people, that hath no great meanes to gette deerer cure: yet alwaies the body and humors muſt be prepared, as ye haue heard in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall chapter; and the frictions vſed with diſcrerion, as ye ſhall heare, and not to rub im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatly, as do many ignorants, who doe miſchiefe to the people by their vnskilfulneſſe, thinking to take away thoſe humors that doe moleſt the body, and in the meane tyme, doe conſume the good humors and radicall humidity, of the which appeare greater acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents then before. Therfore it ſhall be well done, that no man preſume to cure thys way, except he know wel the temperature of the perſon, the kinde of ſicknes, the time moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp; the true method to do the ſame, after this forme folowing.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, the way of life muſt bee ordained as you haue heard, after that, the Patient muſt be purged with medicaments proper to the humor that offendeth, alwaies vſing ſuch things as are ſet downe in the generall chapter for the preparation of the humors, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the ſections of the vaines, with the baths, in the which muſt be put ſuch thinges as are ſet downe in the generall chapter, or els warme water alone, in the which you may put 2. or 3. gallons of Milke, the which is good to appeaſe the dolors and ſoften the skin. Yee ſhal enter the firſt day once, afterward twiſe euery day, remaining one houre, or ſo long as ye may wel endure, obſeruing alwaies before, after, and in the bath, ſuch things as I haue ſet downe in my Chirurgerie chap. of baths. Thus yee ſhal continue 5. or 6. daies, as ſhall be found needful. If the body be dry and hote, accompanied with nodoſities &amp; hardnes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts, &amp; retraction of the members, as ſomtime happeneth either being inueterat or oft vnder cure before, in cold weather &amp; not warmly kept. In that caſe we ad diuers ſorts of hearbs, which haue vertue to ſoften: namely, Mallows, Violets, Pellitory, Patience, Fume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Cammomell, and Roſes; take of each a handful &amp; ſeeth them a little in water before ye put them in the bath: afterward, being gon out of the bath, he ſhalbe dryed and put in a warme bed, afterward annoynt him with ſuch things as haue the vertue to looſe and ſoften the hard parts, like as <hi>Axungia humana, Anatis, Anſeris, et Galline, an vnc 2. Axungie porci, butyri recentis ſine ſale, an vnc 1. Medulle vituline, et cernine, vnc ſs.

               <p>THE body and humors being prepared as you haue heard, the Patient ſhall be put in a place naturally warme, or in the cold weather it ſhall be made warme by Art, exempt of all cold and wind, which may penetrate in the body, and hinder the operations of the medicaments. For this cauſe, thoſe that doe meddle with thys ſort of cure, ſhould haue a little cloſe Chamber with a chimney, where alwaies ſhould be fire, the which muſt be great in the time of the friction, and that in the morning at 5. or 6. of the clock, as time moſt propper. If the Patient be weak, giue him an Egge, or ſome other thing of light digeſtion, an houre before, &amp; halfe an houre after, a drink of the firſt decoction warme. That being done, there muſt be a reaſonable fire, the which the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall ſtand before, turning alwaies about, to the end the heate may penetrate in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſides, and vniuerſally throughout the body. Put a cloth about his head, another about his belly, to the end the vnguent touch neither of theſe two parts: then yee ſhall begin the friction at the articles, as hands, ſhoulders, elbowes, &amp; knees, afterward, vniuerſally throughout the whole body, excepting alwaies the head &amp; the belly, the which is annoynted by ſome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norants, cauſing thereby death, or ſome cruell accidents. Rub wel, to the end it may pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the better, and let the friction be more copious in the parts affected then in the reſt. The vnguent being ſoked in a part, you muſt haue a hote ſheete &amp; put it about him, ſo lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in a hote bed, which ſhall be well couered with many clothes, not heauie, there he ſhall ſweat an houre or two, or as long as he may endure. If the ſweat come not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, put to his feet and ſhoulders ſome hote ſtones, or pots of earth, or of glaſſe, or ſome bladders full of the ſame decoction warme, as ye haue heard in the cure by decoction. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing ſweat ſufficientlie, rub him wel with warme dry clothes til he be almoſt dry, ſo take the ſheete from him, and after that rub him a ſpace with warme linnen, till he be perfectly dry. Be diligent in rubbing well his head, afterward let him refreſh himſelfe ſoftly: ſo two howrs after he may dine, and doe the like after-noone, and other times when ye ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt him. Yet there muſt be both mediocritie and method in the annoynting: for like as our ſoft annoynting is not able to open the poares, in like manner the ouer-ſtrong dooth open the poars of the skin, making dolor, attraction, and commotion of the parts. Take alwaies heede to the forces of the ſick, &amp; beware of that which is cauſe of all dolors and recidiues: that is, the number of the frictions, by reaſon that ſome giue ouer-few, fearing theſe accidents, and to the contrary, ſome others that gyue ouer-many, in ſuch ſort that I haue heard men vaunt themſelues, to haue rubbed the poore Patient 37. times. Before I had found out other waies for the cure of this dieaſe, I haue rubbed to the number of 5. or 6, times, and oft-times but twiſe or thrice. Neuertheleſſe, the time may not be iuſtlie limitted: but for the greatneſſe of the ſickneſſe, and temperature of the ſicke, wee vſe the frictions till we perceiue a reduction of the venimous humors, eyther by fluxe of mouth or of belly, or of vrine, and ſometimes by inſenſible reſolution, but that is ſeldome and not certaine. If we ſee in bodies ſtrong and hard, that nature will not worke nor obey the frictions by once a day annoynting, then they muſt be twice, that is, at 6. of the clocke in the morning, &amp; two or three in the after-noone, ſo that one day that way, doth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit then two daies other waies. In weake and tender perſons yee muſt annoynt but once a day, and ſomtimes but once in two dayes, by reaſon that in ſuch people, the ouer-oft an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting, maketh a reſolution of the ſpirits, and maketh nature weake. VVhen the ſicke beginneth to ſpet, it is a token that the humors are prepared to auoyde, and then once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting wil doe more then twice before, and it ſhall be well done to rubbe but once, or twice at the moſt afterward. So when nature giueth leyſure to expell the venim, if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the euacuation doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue till the whole malice be euacuated, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make it continue, wee apply Emplaiſters on the necke and ſhoulders, compoſed after the forme as ye ſhall heare in the chap. of the cure by Emplaiſters; ſo that it ſhall continue the fluxe to the perfect euacuation. For the ſame effect we may vſe one Pill or two, compoſed as you ſhall heare in the cure by Pills. In like manner, 8. gra. of my powder, called <hi>Puluis
<pb facs="tcp:10476:12"/>
Arabicus,</hi> which ſhall be taken in Conſerue of Roſes. Somtimes the fluxe of the mouth is ſo great, that we are conſtrained to ſtay it by Emplaſters aſtringents, as of Maſtick, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra rupturum, de bolo,</hi> and ſuch like, on the neck and ſhoulders ventouſes: alſo frictions with hote clothes; in like manner Gargariſmes, as ye ſhall heare in the chapter of vlcers in the mouth: In like manner by Clyſters emolients, to diuertiſe the humor to aſcend to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior parts: ſomtimes by vſing all theſe remedies, the criſe is imperfect, ſo leaues ſome reſt, the which by little &amp; little doth corrupt the whole maſſe, and ſo maketh worſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents then before. Somtimes it remaineth in the body halfe a yeere, or a yeere, ſometimes 8. or 10. yeres, chiefely in perſons mellancholick and cold. So the moſt part of thoſe dieth moſt miſerably, by reaſon of the great internall corruption before any external apperance.</p>
               <p>But to returne to our purpoſe, we muſt take heede, that the remedies be neyther ouer violent nor indiſcreetly applyed, by reaſon of the great accidents which enſue there-vpon, and chiefely excoriation and corroſion of the inteſtins, conſumption of the humor radicall, whereof the ſicke becommeth tabid, or getteth vlcers, ſordids, and putrids in the mouth, which oft conſumeth a great part of the muſcles that moue the iawes, ſo the action doth decay. To ſome the iawes goe together, ſo that afterward they are ſcarcely able to open their mouth, as in Paris a Boy that had beene handled that way, his teeth did all fall, and his iawes growe together, in ſuch ſort that nothing could enter into his mouth, ſo was I conſtrained to make inciſion through all the gums, and ſo I healed him, yet could he not come to the perfection to eate any hard thing. Some degenerat in gangrens, ſo that diuers dye miſerablie. As for the corroſion of the guts, which often happeneth, you ſhall vſe Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters remollients, as this, <hi>Recipe maluar.

As for the vlcers of the mouth, haue recourſe to the propper chap. of vlcers. I haue found out an inuention for the vſage of the friction, the which is both more pleaſant and profitable, then that which you haue heard, as heere followeth. In ſteed that ſome put before the fire, I put them in a hote ſtoue being warmed with decoction of things propper, to ſoften and rarifie the poares, ſo by that meanes all the parts are all a like hote, the which is not before the fire, by reaſon that one ſide beeing warme, the other is cold, beſides that there be ſome who would be aſhamed to be ſeene naked, and in the ſtoue they are not ſeene. Then the patient being there hote, with a cloth about his head, you ſhall giue him a little of the vnguent by a hole made for the purpoſe, and let him rub him ſelfe in ſuch places, and after the forme that you haue heard. That being done, put him in a hot ſheete in bed, and couer him as before. By this means he ſhall haue the fluxe of the mouth as the other, and in a ſhorter ſpace. During the time of the which fluxe the patient muſt be nouriſhed with things licquid, and of good iuice, and light digeſtion, like as ſoft Egs, pottage, made of yolke of Eggs, conſumats made of extremities of Calfes, or of Fowles, French barley, Horge Munde, of the which you ſhall vſe little, and oft, waſhing alwayes the mouth after, remembring that neyther before, nor in the time of the fluxe muſt bee vſed any waſhing, or drinke, or any cold thing, the which things all doe ſtay the fluxe. If the patient be weary of theſe things, you may infuſe white bread in wine, and mingle with it a little barley water, thereafter ſtrayning the bread, that the ſubſtance remayne in the wine. If in this time the patient be conſtipat, vſe ſomtymes Clyſters, Lenitiues, or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories.</p>

               <p>THE Emplaſters are thought to haue the ſame effect that the liniments haue, if the body be prepared, as you haue heard in the generall Chapter.

<pb facs="tcp:10476:12"/>
that, there be alſo ſome Quickſiluer mingled with it, prepared as you haue hearde, the which hath vertue againſt the venim, which is cauſe of the ſicknes, the Emplaſters haue great vertue on the part where-vpon it is applied, both by reaſon of the ingredients, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe they remaine alwayes adherent to the part, ſo their actions are continuall, and are ordinarily applied where the humors are groſſe and vitius, adherent to the part ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, like as Tophes and Nodoſities, they alſo mittigate the dolors, and reſolue the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſo that they remaine a certaine time: for lyke as that venim is rooted for a time, in like manner time muſt be had for the extirpation of the ſame. So in that they be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Neuertheleſſe I thinke not the Emplaſter or cerot hath force to make euacuations ſufficient, for the extirpation of the ſicknes. I haue ſomtimes proued it, and haue cured ſome that way, others I haue beene conſtrayned to ſeeke an other way of cure. I conſeſſe in all perſons being vſed it doth take away a part of the euill, ſo it hideth the ſicknes for a time.

In ſome perſons if the humors be well prepared, &amp; in good ſeaſon, the Emplaſters begin to make eduction of the humor, in 3, or 4, dayes, moſt commonly by the mouth, the which ſomtimes is ſo violent, that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſtay it: firſt by taking away a part of theſe Emplaſters, and after that ſtay the violent fluxe by ſuch meanes as you haue heard in the Chapter of frictions.

               <p>PErfumes which were vſed of old, and now alſo by ſome ignorant people, for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this malady, the which in no maner are to be approued for that intention, being not poſſible to cure the ſicke that way. They be moſt ſtrong and vehement, of the which come great accidents, and oftentimes death, ſpecially to thoſe that are leane and of temperature hote and dry, as I haue oft ſeene. In Paris in the time of the troubles, there was great companies of Spaniards and Neapolitans, amongſt the which was a Barber Neapolitan, who profeſſed to heale al diſeaſes, but chiefely this, by the means of his perfumes, ſo that it happened him one time to haue eight vnder cure, of the which
<pb facs="tcp:10476:13"/>
fiue dyed, three lyued, and of them three, two became paralatick, and one deaffe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others dyed in his hands. I haue ſeene infinit others dye by the ignorance of ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who handle men lyke Horſes, vſing onely one method to all men, little and great, ſtrong and weake. Of this little number that eſcapeth ſome become tabid, ſome hidio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, for they are moſt hurtful to the lungs, &amp; maketh great reſolution of the ſpirits, which haue great conximitie with the braines, ſo that the ſpirits animall is deprauated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed: to diuers happeneth contraction of the ſinewes, paraliſie, trembling, apolexie, with diuers other euil accidents, of the which, if time would permit, I ſhould giue many examples. For theſe cauſes and diuers other, I thinke it not meete, eyther to ſhewe the way or the iuſt doſe of their poyſonable ingredients, like as Orpin, Calcant, Cinnaber, and ſuch like, by reaſon that perhaps ſome men will be ſo vnhappy as to vſe them. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I doubt not, but perfumes ſuch as we vſe, are a great help for ſome perticuler af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which remaine after the cure done by any of the three wayes precedent, as deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, payne in the head, ioynts, leggs, and armes, falling of haire, and ſuch like. Wherein I haue knowne them to haue done great good, both to tenuat and inciſe: as alſo to expell out by ſweat, that which remaineth; the which nature, (eyther deprauated or hindered,) could not caſt forth, by reaſon of the ſicknes and tenacitie of the humor, and alſo of the skin and narrownes of the paſſages. So, if the vertue to prouoke ſweat, as alſo to looſe the belly, be alwaies moderatly vſed, and compoſed onely with ſuch things, and after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ye ſhal heare, (the which ſhall not be ſtrong, to the end they may make no reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the vertues, neyther hinder them, nor depriue the action of the parts:) then they ſhall be made of the rootes of <hi>Dictam, Peonie, Tormentil, Iris florentie, Cinamon, Francum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, Maſticke, Oliban, Ladanum, an drag, 2.

The tub muſt be hote before he enter in, he muſt be all naked, and ſitte on a ſtoole, putting on either ſide of him an inſtrument of yron or braſſe, wherein ſhall be little cleere coales, vpon the which ye ſhall caſt of theſe powders here named, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weight of one dragm or two, and ſo ſhall continue a certaine ſpace, or ſo long as hee may endure, to receiue the fume of the ſame, till ſuch time as he ſweat. If it be poſsible, he ſhall keep his eyes cloſe, and put out ſomtimes his head. If the vapour be ouer-great, beware that hee ſwound not, as many doe. Therefore as ſoone as yee ſee him growe faint, retire him, and put him in a bed, wrapping him in a warme ſheete, and put hote clothes on his ſtomacke and belly, ſo he ſhall ſweat eaſily an howre or two without violence. Afterward dry him, and vſe him in ſuch ſort as yee haue heard in the Chapter of decoction, &amp; as alſo touching the way of lyfe.

And if the taking of it in the morning doth not ſufficiently worke, you may take as much in the after-noone. Somtime by vſing of it twice a day it worketh too faſt, wherefore you muſt well conſider and take it but once in one day, or once in two dayes, according as you find it work, and if it worketh as it ought to doe, it ſhall be 5, or 6, times euery day without violence.

               <p>SEeing that in the formsr chapters I haue plainly ſhewed, after what method our Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and I my ſelfe in like manner haue cured old folks of this diſeaſe, now in like manner I will ſet downe the way to cure young Infants. True it is, that diuers Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticioners haue of a long time taken paines to find out ſome certaine method for the ſame, ſeeing the great number that daily were infected, partly by their Parents, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by their Nurſes, and ſuch other cauſes, as ye haue heard in the Chapter of the cauſes of this diſeaſe. But no true or perfect, curation could be found by them, becauſe they were contented with ſome Paleatiue remedies, whereby the chyldren ſeemed to bee healed tyll they came to be 2. or 3. yeeres old: in the which time, by the acrimonie or ſharpnes of the maligne humor, the bones doe conſume, the roofe of the mouth and noſe doe fall, ſo that not one amongſt a thouſand eſcapeth miſerable death. Whereupon, I conſidering theſe things, (and as I had found out ſome eaſie way for old folks, ſo being requeſted by many of my ſpeciall freends, and diuers other honeſt men, whoſe children were infected, to ſette out ſome certaine method for the deliuery of ſuch young infants, who vndeſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were deſtroied with this diſeaſe,) after long trauaile I found out 2. or 3. waies, the which in deede are good, but very painfull, ſo that afterward, by mine owne diligence, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent conference with ſome of the Docters in Chirurgerie in Paris, I founde out thys vvay, which is moſt ſure and eaſie, if it be done with good iudgment, and with the method that followeth.

This being done, you ſhall cauſe the Nurſe or your ſelfe, to rub the liske, which is the part betweene the thigh and the body, the firſt daie. After that, reſt a daie or two, and rub the thighes a little: this will prouoke a fluxe of the belly.

Of thoſe which goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which we call precedents or forriders, is vlcers and cankors of diuers faſhions in the yeard, burning of vrine, Chaudepiſſes, Carnoſities, Pulluines, and ſuch like. Yet ſomtimes any of theſe may happen without the ſicknes. Thoſe that followe, bee puſtuls and vlcers throughout all the bodie, cheefely in the ſecret parts, and alſo in the forhead, and diuers other parts of the head, in the emunctories, in the mouth, throat, and fundament, falling of hayre, dolors and nodoſities of the ioynts. Thoſe that happen in the cure, are lack of appetite and walking, vlcers in the mouth, inteſtins and conduit of vrine, with diuers others, which happeneth in diuers manners, according vnto the varieties of the waies of cure. Thoſe that happen after the vnperfect cure, make diuers euill accidents, as the fixed greefe of the whole head, or ſome part thereof: alſo of the legs, armes, and ioynts, nodoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with putrifaction of the bones, deafenes, defluxions of the eyes, filthy and creeping vlcers, Fiſſures, and Darters in the hands, feete, and diuers other parts of the body, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of ſubſtance, ſo that the body becommeth leane and atrified.

Some doe ende in gangrene or mortification, and then we are conſtrayned to cute the whole member, or at the leaſt, ſome portion thereof. For the which you may haue recourſe to my Chirurgie, Chapter of gangrene. Somtimes theſe vlcers doe degenerat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Carcinomes, which if ſo happeneth, you may haue recourſe to the Chirurgie, Chapter of Carcinomes. It ſhall be well done, not to neglect the ſimpleſt vlcer in the yearde. For oftentimes by the neglecting of the vniuerſall curation in the beginning, and vſing onelie ſome repercuſſiue and aſtringent remedies, the diſeaſe is healed but for a time, ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it returneth within halfe a yeare, or a yeare, or two yeares, ſooner or later, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the habitude of the perſon diſeaſed. I handled in Paris a Gentleman, who tenne yeares afore had a ſimple vlcer in his yearde, and being euill cured by ſorce of repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiues, the venim did retire to the center of the body. So after the ten yeares vlcers and puſtuls appeared in his yearde and at the perineum, the prostats and paraſtats became all putrified, and in like manner the whole ſcrotum. So he dyed miſerably, notwithſtanding all remedies, as many doe, when the humor virulent is retired and hidden long time in the body, the which may chaunce in old folks. For in ſuch it conſumeth inwardly before any appearance without. But to returne to our purpoſe, for the curation of maligne vlcers in the yearde, we muſt vſe ſome light purgations, letting of blood, good regime, according to the temperature of the body, vſing alſo decoction of Gaiac and Salſparill, abſtayning from all ſtrong purgatious, alſo bleeding of the arme or any ſuperior part, by reaſon that the ſtrong medicines doe reuoke the humor to the centre of the body, the which nature would diſcharge by the vlcers, letting of blood in the armes, or any ſuperior parts doeth the ſame. So that if theſe things be not well obſerued, the generall ſicknes followeth: for this cauſe the purgation ſhall be weake, and the letting of blood in the inferior parts, as in the leggs or feete, alſo with ſuch method that the part affected be not irrited. As for the ſimple vlcers, that be not maligne, but come onely by great rubbing on women that be hote, or by great violence on little Maides, or by ſome women y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are ouer-ſtraight, (which ſeldome happeneth) or by women that haue their purgations, and ſuch other as you haue heard, we vſe onely drying medicaments, and without mordication, like as pouder of Tutia prepared, <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> burnt lead, <hi>Bolus Vera,</hi> and ſuch like. You ſhall put eyther of theſe alone, or diuers together, mingled with ſome medicament, as Pompholix, <hi>Cerat Galien, reſſat Meſue, oyle Roſat.</hi> and apply it on the vlcer, it ſhall preſently be healed, like as any other ſimple vlcers, being vſed after the ſame ſort. If the vlcer be ioyned with ſome other euill affection or intemperie, the cure muſt begin at the taking away of the ſame. But by reaſon the euill temperie may be cold, hote, dry, or moiſt, we muſt diuerſifie the remedies, according to the intemperie of the humor. And if the intemperie be hote, you ſhall vſe cold things, like as fomentation of iuice of Plantin or water of the ſame, Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade, Knotgraſſe, Paſtorſpurſe. Theſe, or eyther of them ſhall be applyed on the part, and about the part a cloth wet of Oxicrat, or Emplaiſter of Dyapalma, malaxed with oyle <hi>Roſat. cerat Galien, Nutritum, de bolo,</hi> and diuers others of like quality. If the temperie be cold, vſe things contrarie, like as fomentation of Claret wine, in the which ſhall be ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Sage, Origanum, Time, Calaminte, Mariorum, Fenell, Melilot, and ſuch like. If the intemperie be very cold, add to it a little of Aquae-vitae. The dry intemperie is cured by fomenting the part with hote water, continuing till it groweth red, which ſhall humect it. If the intemperature be humid, it muſt be dryed, as much as it aboundeth in moiſt. For therebe ſome parts that be humid of them ſelues, &amp; theſe muſt be more dryed then other parts which be leſſe moiſt. As for example the Balanus muſt be more dryed then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce that couereth it, by reaſon it is more humid. The intemperie being taken away, we come to the curation of the vlcer, for the which we diuerſifie the remedie, according to the nature of the ſayd vlcer. Then firſt you ſhall perceaue if it be virulent, which is leſſe ſuſpected then the ſordid. The vlcers virulent and corroſiues doe proceede of corrupted bilious humor, the which taketh the origine from the vlcers which are in the conduits of women, being irrited eyther by great confrication, or elſe by ſome venim in the capacitie of the matrix, which newlie hath beene receaued by ſome man infected with Gonorrhea

Virulent, or vlcer in the yeard, the which humor being rendered more maligne and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, ſticketh preſently to the poroſities of the yeard, and there-vpon falleth a great heat and dolor pricking and corrodent, which vlcereth the part, the cullour whereof is yellow towards the midſt, the borders be pale or red, the figures vnequalls. For the curation of the which, firſt you ſhall order good regime, purgations, letting of blood, obſeruing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuch cautions, as you haue heard, auoyding to vſe no medicine that be of ſacultie repercuſſiue, for in theſe we muſt take heede that we ſhould not chaſe the humors to the noble parts, or to any other part: for nature ſending that way, if you put it backe with repercuſſiue medicaments, vndoubtedly the Spaniſh ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Therfore you ſhall hold from the part affected, (as alſo from other parts neere to it) remedies repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiues, for ſuch reaſons as you haue heard. In the beginning vſe ſuch as haue the force to dull the arcimonie of the humor, like as to touch it with water of Sublimat, or ſtrong wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the blew water, which is commonly vſed, or pouder of Mercury, or a little of my pouder ſet downe in <hi>The Poore mans guide,</hi> called <hi>Puluis Neapolitanus,</hi> moſt excellent for diuers vlcers. That being done, you ſhall prouoke the fall of the Eſcare, the which ſhall be done by the application of theſe remedies, like as Vnguent Baſilicon, Butter, Muſcilages of the ſeede of both Mallowes, and of Line, and ſuch like. Yet beware that the ouer great vſage of theſe remedies ſhould not render the vlcers filthie and rotten. Alſo haue care of the body, for if it be plethorick or cacochimick, the acrimonie of theſe remedies may irrit the vlcers, and ſo cauſe them to degenerat in. Vlcers, Maligns, Gangrens, and Carcinomes. Therefore if you perceaue the vlcers irrited by the venenoſitie of the humor, ſo that there be no remedie, make a particuler rubbing on the adiacent parts, compoſed of things that haue the vertue to reſolue, heate, and conſume, but alwayes you muſt mingle with it a little of Mercure well prepared. For the ſame effect you may vſe particuler perſumes and ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migations: ſuch as is ſet downe in the Chapter of perfumes. Then the malice being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and the virulent humor digered, and become white and thicke, which are ſignes of good nature, mundifie the vlcer, and dry it with proper medicaments, as with pouder of Aloe, Thus, Sarcocolle, Mirth, burnt Lead, Pompholix, the which you may vſe alone, or mingled with ſome oyntment, as Pompholix, Album Raſis, Deſiccatinum Rubenum, or this, <hi>Recipe battature eris, &amp; eris combuſti, vnc. 1, terre sigillate, vnc. 3, olei Maſtic. et Cidon. vnc. 2, fiat Vnguentum.</hi> If by the vſage of theſe remedies the vicers heale not, be aſſured that the body is ouer-charged with humors, and that the generall diſeaſe will followe.

               <head>The 3, Chap. ſheweth the way to cure the Venerean Bubons, which are commonly called Pullains.</head>
               <p>THE body being oppreſſed by this venim and chiefely the Liuer, nature doth force it ſelfe by the vertue expultrice of the ſayd Liuer, to caſt out that which is hurtfull on the parts moſt weake of our body, which are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> little glandes betwixt the thigh and the body, whereof certaine byles and apoſtumes doe proceede, commonlie called Pullains or Bubons, the which for the moſte parte, are colde tumors, of a matter thicke and vitious, and are long in opening. There be other that proceede of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor hote and ſharpe in theſe parts, which doth make great tumor, with great inflamation accompanied with extreame paine. Theſe doe open ſooner. Now of theſe tumors ſome appeare neere the glands, ſome in the membrance that couereth the glands, &amp; ſome in their propper ſubſtance, and of theſe ſome doe apoſtume, others not, and ſome degenerat in vlcers virulens and corroſiues; the which are healed by the generall cure, ſome are cured by particuler cure, ſome retire to the internall parts, and are ſimptoms, precedents, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyders to the generall diſeaſe, like as oft we ſee. As for the curation of thoſe tumors, firſt the regime vniuerſall muſt be duly obſerued in the ſixe vnnaturall things, abſtayning from ſuch things as be contrary, according vnto that which you haue heard in the generall chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the former treatiſe: purge lightly with ſome ſuch things which ſhall onely purge the firſt vaynes, and helpe nature to chaſe the euill humors to the Emunctories. Beware of ſtrong purgations, for they reuoke the humor to the centre of the body, and the letting of blood in the arme doth the ſame effect. Therefore vſe onely ſuch medicines as doe meekely purge, and let onely blood in the legg or foote. As for the topical remedies, they ſhall be neyther reſolutiue nor repercuſſiue, as ſome doe, by reaſon that the reſolutiue doe onely conſume the more ſubtill, and the thicker doth remaine, which is cauſe afterward of the vniuerſall ſicknes, and the repercuſſiue doe reuerberat thoſe maligne and venimous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors into the inward parts, whereby the vniuerſall ſicknes may alſo be cauſed. Therfore thou ſhalt abſtaine from ſuch things, cauſing the ſick to make light exerciſe, for that maketh the humors diſcend and auoyde more eaſily. Alſo for the prouocation of the ſame, yee ſhall applie ventouſes and drawing medicaments, according vnto the nature of the humor. Neuertheleſſe, begin at things more weake, by reaſon that all ſuddaine and violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are hurtfull and dangerous to nature, by making ſuddaine or violent attraction, as alſo for that the tenuitie of the attractiues may make euacuation of a part, the reſt may irrit, &amp; not obey the attractiues. For this cauſe, ye ſhall mingle with the attractiues ſome emplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick medicament, which ſhall be made in this forme following: <hi>Rec. Ficuum pinguinum, num. 6.

Then the perfect maturation being done, it may be opened three waies, to wit, by the Lancet, by the Cautere actuall, and by the Cautere potentiall, the which apertion muſt be made according to the rectitude of the Fibres and that ſhal be done by the potentiall Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere, by reaſon that the heare thereof helpeth the ſuppuration of the cold humor.

For by theſe meanes, nature putteth the humors forth, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame place, or in the emunctories of the hart, as I haue ſeene in one that I haue cured, to whom theſe accidents did happen. The ſuppuration and the opening made, as it ought to be, ye ſhall produce the fall of the Eſcare, either by freſh Butter, Axungie, or Baſilicon, or common digeſtiue. Afterward, mundifie and cicatriſe the vlcer, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. That being done, purge well the body, and let blood alſo, according vnto the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. If it happeneth that the vlcers ſuppure not well, but remaines hard, tumified, and ſordid, the borders turned ouer, reſiſting all common remedies, you ſhall iudge the ſicknes to follow: whereuppon you ſhall vſe good regime for a certaine ſpace, with decoction of Gaiac, and ſome other medicament, to corroborate the noble parts, to the end they may the better chaſe ſorth that which is hurtfull: the which if all be not ſufficient, we come to the generall cure of the diſeaſe, and this is the order that yee ſhall vſe in the curation of theſe tumors.</p>

               <head>The 4. Chapter ſheweth the way to cure the Chaudepiſſe Virulent, called Stranguria Virulenta.</head>
               <p>I Haue heere determined to ſpeake of the fluxe Spermatick and Gonorrhea, virulent or Chaudepiſſe, which is moued by the contagion of thoſe that are infected with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerian venim. Chaudepiſſe is an inflamation of the glands proſtates and paraſtates, ſituate in the beginning of the necke of the bladder, the which are proper domicils to the Sperme, before it be caſt forth. But Chaudepiſſe or Gonorrhea virulent, differeth ſomewhat from Gonorrhea not virulent, becauſe (as ſaith <hi>Gallen,) De locis affectis.</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhea, is an inuolentarie emiſſion of the Sperme, without eyther putrefaction or vlcers, but in the Chaud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>piſſe virulent, is a continuall extention of the yeard, with retraction of the ſame: in like manner, emiſſion not onely of the Sperme as is in the vlcers, but alſo of humors putride. Neuertheleſſe, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſpeak ſomewhat of Gonorrhea not virulent, becauſe it hath ſome affinitie with the other, as alſo becauſe they happen both in thoſe parts. Whereof there is two ſorts, to wit, that which is done by repletion, and that which is done by inanition. By repſetion, as thoſe that haue great aboundance of ſperme, the which ſometime nature of her ſelfe doth expell for to be diſcharged, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may be diſſolued againſt the heate of the ſunne, and by ſetting the backe long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a hote fire, &amp; alſo by riding a trotting horſe, as by all other motions excalefactiues. which inflame thoſe parts, and make fluxion, and ſometime by the vſage of Beere and all foodes vaporous, thick, and vitious, the which make inflamation, and doe cauſe attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors: in like manner, by paine and weakenes of the part, which receiueth not onelie the ſeede, but alſo the euill humors of the parts adiacents, the which putrifie &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low continually by the yeard. Sometime, (as ſaith <hi>Arnaldus,)</hi> it may happen, that it Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumeth by reaſon of the great aboundance of humore, which doe putrifie the proſtates, and that without any outward appearance, as I proued in Paris in a Turke, bond-ſlaue to the Embaſſadour of Spaine, who had ſuch a fluxe for plenitude and lack of womans help, of the which came dolors intollerable inwardly and outwardly, with two great vlcers in the perinium, &amp; ſuppreſſion of vrine, the which accident happened to this man two ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times in three yeeres. It is ſomtime accompanied with great inflamation of one part of the Scrotum, ſomtimes it ſuppureth, other-whiles it reſolueth, which happeneth ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb facs="tcp:10476:18"/>
When this happeneth, neither is the erection of the yeard dolorous, nor the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of water, by reaſon that ſeldom chanceth vlcers in the conduit of the vrine, as alſo little habitation with women, which might haue brought the matter that way, &amp; excoriat thoſe parts, by the acrimonie and putrefaction. So by thys and diuers other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wee may cleerely know, that the ſeede muſt be euacuated, eyther by ordinory meanes or extraordinarie, or els it becommeth putrified, and put forth by ſome Apoſtume, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it remaineth within, of the which come many greeuous maladies.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of Gonorrhea not virulent, is done by inanition, and happeneth oft to thoſe who doe think profoundly of loue, or that haue fine wiues, or elſe that the veſſels ſpermaticall haue receiued ſome ſtroke, or by ſitting vpon colde ſtones, alſo by rubbing with cold liniments, by falls and ſtrokes vpon the loynes, by ouer hot bathes, for by all theſe the veſſels are rendred weake. Furthermore the ſperme being ouer ſharpe and thinne, doth likewiſe ſometime cauſe that accident, which may alſo be cauſed by hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone vſed the act venerean. All theſe make heate and inflamation in thoſe parts, wherby happeneth attraction of the humor, which being drawne, paſſeth continually, partly by the heat, and partly by the weaknes of the vertues retentrices of the ſayd parts. So that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it paſſeth ſanguinolent, halfe elabred, being ſometimes pure blood, the which maketh men become Ethick and Tabids, ſo bringeth death to many of them, by reaſon of the great and continuall euacuation of the vitall ſpirits which paſſe with the ſeede. So that in no way this is to be neglected. Somtimes this happeneth to men for one of theſe three cauſes, the which are all but friuolous. The firſt is to appeaſe the great appetite of that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall loue which they beare to their wiues, not hauing their minds occupyed in any affaires, but in thoſe vanities, &amp; ſuch men are better willing then their hability ſufficeth. Secondly they doe it to vaunt their ſelues, to be ſo mighty in the action that no man can approach them, &amp; this is a fooliſh vaunt without profit: nay it is very hurtfull to the body. Thirdly they doe it for the great affection that they haue to get children, thinking by oft vſing their wiues, that they ſhall ſooner procreat, wherein they are much deceiued. For not gyuing leaſure to the ſeede to be ſufficiently elabored, ſo that it is no more profitable then water, for that effect. There be two properties which the good ſeede ought to haue, as I haue am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie ſet downe in the Treatiſe of <hi>The ſicknes of women,</hi> in the Chapter of the cauſes, and the cure of ſterilitie. Firſt, there muſt be a reaſonable quantitie of the ſeede: next it muſt be well digeſted, gluent, and full of ſpirits, the which two poynts fayleth in thoſe that returne to it ſo oft. For neyther haue they quantitie, nor giue they leyſure to digeſt the ſame. So that they proue ſooles, to ruine their bodies without eyther honor or profit. This ſicknes is called in our tongue the Reples, for the curation whereof, (as alſo of Satyriaſis &amp; Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſmus) you ſhall heare at length in the Treatiſe called <hi>The poore mans guide.</hi> But to returne to our purpoſe, the Gonorrhea or Chaudepiſſe virulent, the which is done by ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous ſprite that infecteth thoſe parts: The cauſe is by hauing to doe with women that are vncleane, whereby men get the infection of that venenoſitie which hath aſſoped and infected ſuch parts. The ſimptoms are extreame dolor in making water by the acrimonie of the humor, which maketh eroſion and vlcers, chiefely in the proſtats, and alſo neere the balhnus or gland, by reaſon of the ſimpathie, that theſe parts haue one with an other, and great payne in the erection of the yeard, which maketh contraction of the ſame. Of the which doth often follow the generall ſicknes, and that oft by their owne negligence, neglecting the remedies, thinking that by ſuffering the ſame runne a long time, the humor venimous ſhould be euacuated, not thinking that the venenoſitie doth alwayes augment it ſelfe by the acrimonie of the humor, which doth communicat to the noble parts, or at the leaſt doth degenerat into maligne vlcers in thoſe parts, which be very difficult to heale. VVhich accidents doe alſo happen ſometimes by carnoſities in the yeard, hindering the vrine to paſſe, ſo that oft commeth death, if ſuddaine order be not taken. As for the cure of Gonorrhea virulent, the vniuerſall things muſt be obſerued according to the habitude of the body.

               <p>THIS which wee call carnoſitie, is an excreſcence of the fleſh, which groweth in the conduit of vrine, or channell of the wand or yeard, the which happeneth by reaſon of ſome vlcers, or excoriation in thoſe parts, cauſed by acrimonie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and vrine: the which corrodeth and vlcereth the paſſage of vrine in men, &amp; the necke of the matrixe in women, of the which come moſt grieuous ſickneſſes, and oftentimes death, if that the learned and skilfull Chirurgian giue not the better order for the curation hereof, which ſhall conſiſt in remedies vniuerſall and particuler, as alſo medicaments.

Yet in the applying of the ſame, there muſt be good iudgement vſed, by reaſon that the parts about it be ſoft and delicat, and ſo eaſie to excoriat, alſo very ſenſible and dolorous. For this cauſe, firſt of all we muſt well conſider if the Caruncle be olde or recent, for beeing old, oftentimes it happeneth that they be ſo hard that the medicaments cannot worke ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.

               <p>THere happeneth oftentimes certaine little excreſſence of fleſh like Warts betwixt the gland and prepuce, of the which there are two ſorts. The one proceedeth of the venerian ſicknes, the other not: yet neyther of them both for the moſt part dollorous, but very much troubleſome, by reaſon of the great number of them. The cauſe of ſuch as are venimous is the euill indiſpoſition of women accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome infection. Thoſe which are not venimous happen by hauing to doe with women in the time of their purgations, of the which happeneth not onely that, but alſo many other greeuous diſeaſes both to the men, &amp; alſo the children, which are conceaued at that time, for eyther they become Leapors vniuerſally, or ſome particuler part, which we call Elephanciaſis particuler, or if this happen not, yet the child is alwayes ſickly, and of ſhort lyfe: for this and diuers other cauſes it was forbidden in the 18, Chapter of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus to vſe the company of women at that time. But to returne to our putpoſe for the curing of theſe parts, whether they happen of the venerian ſicknes or otherwiſe, we muſt firſt conſider whether they be recent and ſoft, or inueterate and hard, as ſomtime it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth. If hard and inueterat, they muſt be ſoftened by ſuch remedies as you haue heard in the Chapter of Carnoſitie, and being ſoftened, they muſt be conſumed with powder of Sabine and Ocre well puluerized with an Emplaiſter of Cerus and a little Quickſiluer: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſumed, vſe for the cicatrizing ſuch as you haue heard in Carnoſitie.

The cauſe of this ſimptom is eyther that the aliment, wherewith the haire is nouriſhed, is corrupted and conſumed, or that the skin is dryed and preſſed together, ſo that it may not ingender that ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fuliginous, whereby the haire is ingendred and nouriſhed. For the cure we muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacust the euill humor generally through all the bodie, or at leaſt of the parts affected, which may be done two wayes, to wit exterior and interior. Interior by maſticators to prouoke ſpitting, as Pereter, Maſtick, Pepper, after which we vſe exterior medicines, to cauſe the head to ſweat, by laying many clothes on the Patient, I find no remedie better for it, than by a hot houſe, or the reflex of heate which goeth from the fornis to the place where the head ſhall lye. If after euacuation the body be infected, there muſt be generall euacuation for that purpoſe, &amp; herein you ſhall vſe the decoction of Salſparill and Gaiac for the ſpace of 15, dayes, with a little of my confection euery day, which is ſufficient to euacuat the humor, which offendeth. After this prouoke newe haire where it wanteth, which may be done ſundry wayes, yet ſomwhat painfull, for the which I will impart vnto you a very rare ſecret for growing of haire, and of great vallue, which I haue vſed in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of diuers great men, when all their haire hath beene fallen, and within a ſhort ſpace it grew againe by helpe of this remedie, made after this manner. Take the rootes &amp; leaues of Mallowes put of them in a ſtill one bed, then a bed of Honney, and ſo forth, one bed of them, and an other of Honney, till the ſtill be full.
