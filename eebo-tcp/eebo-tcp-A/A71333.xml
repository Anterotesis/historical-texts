            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe ≈øecond in≈øtant the King of <hi>Spain</hi> came to Fontarabia; the fir≈øt ceremony of the Kings Marriage with the Infanta was performed the next day by the Bi≈øhop of Pampolona, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Patriarch of the India's, in the Church of that Town, the Ceremonies whereof you had in the la≈øt. I ≈øhall add only what particulars of con≈øequence that were then omitted. The Bi≈øhop of Frojus was there to ≈øee the Ceremony, with Two or three hundred French Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Madamoi≈øelle was there al≈øo, but <hi>incognito,</hi> and went for the waiting Gentlewoman of the Lady No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

yet the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> guards had ≈øom ≈øpeciall re≈øpect for her, and kept her from being mole≈øted by the crowd, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ma≈øs. Aafter the reading of the King's Proxy to Don Lewis d' Aro, the renunciation made by the Infanta of any preten≈øions to the States of Spain was al≈øo read, which ≈øhe then confirmed by an Oath. The re≈øt of the ceremonyes u≈øed then were not much differing from the ceremony is u≈øed at other mariages, but onely in point of ≈øtateline≈øs. It was ob≈øerved that the Infanta kneeled twice before the King her Father, the fir≈øt time to ask his ble≈ø≈øing, and the ≈øecond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øhe gave her con≈øent to the mariage. She did ≈øhed teares at fir≈øt, but ≈øoon after ≈øhe appeared very re≈øolute. The King of Spain who ≈øtood covered all the while, took the Ring, as it was agreed the day before, and did put it on his Daughter's finger. The ceremony being ended, the King of Spain ≈øhewed her all the re≈øpect due to ≈øuch a Queen, and gave her the right hand, both at the coming out of the Church, and in his owne Coach. He likewi≈øe gave her his owne lodgings and took hers; and that new Queen, which as yet had not been ≈øeen in publick, dined there publickly in a large room, where Madamoi≈øelle and all the French there ru≈øhed in in a croud. When the ≈øaid Queen had dined, ≈øhe ≈ømiled upon Madamoi≈øelle, and told her ≈øhe very well knew the unknown Lady whom ≈øhe called into her owne chamber, and gave her many te≈øtimonyes of her affections, after which Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moi≈øelle returned hither with much ≈øatisfaction. About two a clock in the afternoon, the news of that ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Duke of Crequi, fir≈øt Gentleman of the King's chamber, went with a very great and gallant retinue, and abundance of Nobility accompanying him from hence, to carry the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents to the new Queen, the particulars whereof you have hereafter; ≈øhe received them with all the demon≈øtrations of joy that can be imagined.

               <p>The ≈øame day the Queen mother went to the I≈øle of the Conference, where ≈øhe came about 2 a clock in the afternoon, and ≈øoon after the King of Spain and the Queen his Daughter with her Ladies of honor, came there in a Galliot, covered, painted within and without, being followed with another wherein was Don Lewis De Haro and ≈øeveral Spani≈øh Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees; after whom came a great number of ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels, very gallant, wherein was the re≈øt of the Spani≈øh Court.

The King of Spain came a≈øhore fir≈øt, and took the Queen his Daughter by the hand, and conducted her to the very doore of the Chamber of the Conference, where the Queen Mother of France, the Kings brother, and the Cardinal Mazarine were: we hear not as yet what was done at that meeting, but they looked all to bevery well ≈øatisfied at their coming out.

               <p>Not content to have ≈øeen her there, the King went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ≈øhore, where he had a full ≈øight of her going again into the Galliot.
