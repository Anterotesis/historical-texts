            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond inſtant the King of <hi>Spain</hi> came to Fontarabia; the firſt ceremony of the Kings Marriage with the Infanta was performed the next day by the Biſhop of Pampolona, with the aſſiſtance of the Patriarch of the India's, in the Church of that Town, the Ceremonies whereof you had in the laſt. I ſhall add only what particulars of conſequence that were then omitted. The Biſhop of Frojus was there to ſee the Ceremony, with Two or three hundred French Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Madamoiſelle was there alſo, but <hi>incognito,</hi> and went for the waiting Gentlewoman of the Lady No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:97700:272"/>
yet the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> guards had ſom ſpeciall reſpect for her, and kept her from being moleſted by the crowd, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Maſs. Aafter the reading of the King's Proxy to Don Lewis d' Aro, the renunciation made by the Infanta of any pretenſions to the States of Spain was alſo read, which ſhe then confirmed by an Oath. The reſt of the ceremonyes uſed then were not much differing from the ceremony is uſed at other mariages, but onely in point of ſtatelineſs. It was obſerved that the Infanta kneeled twice before the King her Father, the firſt time to ask his bleſſing, and the ſecond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe gave her conſent to the mariage. She did ſhed teares at firſt, but ſoon after ſhe appeared very reſolute. The King of Spain who ſtood covered all the while, took the Ring, as it was agreed the day before, and did put it on his Daughter's finger. The ceremony being ended, the King of Spain ſhewed her all the reſpect due to ſuch a Queen, and gave her the right hand, both at the coming out of the Church, and in his owne Coach. He likewiſe gave her his owne lodgings and took hers; and that new Queen, which as yet had not been ſeen in publick, dined there publickly in a large room, where Madamoiſelle and all the French there ruſhed in in a croud. When the ſaid Queen had dined, ſhe ſmiled upon Madamoiſelle, and told her ſhe very well knew the unknown Lady whom ſhe called into her owne chamber, and gave her many teſtimonyes of her affections, after which Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle returned hither with much ſatisfaction. About two a clock in the afternoon, the news of that ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>emony was brought to the King, who received it with much joy, as did alſo the Queen mother, who looks upon that mariage as her owne worke. That night there was a great Ball<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The fourth inſtant

the Duke of Crequi, firſt Gentleman of the King's chamber, went with a very great and gallant retinue, and abundance of Nobility accompanying him from hence, to carry the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the new Queen, the particulars whereof you have hereafter; ſhe received them with all the demonſtrations of joy that can be imagined. The Marquis of Vardos com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented her likewiſe in the Kings name as ſome daies before the Count de Noailles Captaine of the Kings life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard did.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Queen mother went to the Iſle of the Conference, where ſhe came about 2 a clock in the afternoon, and ſoon after the King of Spain and the Queen his Daughter with her Ladies of honor, came there in a Galliot, covered, painted within and without, being followed with another wherein was Don Lewis De Haro and ſeveral Spaniſh Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees; after whom came a great number of ſmall Veſſels, very gallant, wherein was the reſt of the Spaniſh Court. The ſhore was full of people, who admired the beauty of that Princeſs, which was much advantaged by the great quantity of Diamonds that were upon her rich garments. The King of Spain came aſhore firſt, and took the Queen his Daughter by the hand, and conducted her to the very doore of the Chamber of the Conference, where the Queen Mother of France, the Kings brother, and the Cardinal Mazarine were: we hear not as yet what was done at that meeting, but they looked all to bevery well ſatisfied at their coming out. During their Conference the K: of France was incognito on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, within a musket ſhot, between a Riv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Don Lewis de Haro and the Cardinal Mazarine,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:97700:273"/>
who managed that buſineſs, for his Majeſties ſatisfaction, ſtood by the doore the better to conceal him all the while he was there. His Majeſty retired after with much ſatisfaction, and declared to all that he had found the Queen very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>Not content to have ſeen her there, the King went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhore, where he had a full ſight of her going again into the Galliot. From thence the Spaniſh Court returned to Fontarabia, and their Majeſties came likewiſe hither. The 5 the King ſent a Complement to the King and Queen of Spain by Mr. de Ballinghew the firſt Gentleman of the Horſe. The 6 the two Kings met together in Private at the Iſle of the Conference; and returned again thither the next day, with their whole Courts. During the whole time of their Interview both the Kings were ſtill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then having delivered his Daughter into the Kings hands, the Queen Mother took her in her Coach, and the two Kings pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The new Queen being come to St. John de Luz, had the whole next day, being the 8 Inſtant, to wipe off her tears, The ſame the Spaniſh begun their Journey towards Madrid. The King ſent the Marquis de Villequier, to complement the King of Spain before his departure. The 9 the laſt Ceremony of the Marriage was performed, whereat Cardinal Mazarine diſcharged the place of grand Almoner; Madamoiſelle carried the Taper; and the two Princeſſes of Alencon and Valois her Siſters caryed the Queens Train, with the Princeſs of Carignan.</p>

After the taking of the Oath, the two Kings ſigned it, and afterwards they imbraced one another. The Guards on both ſides gave two Volleys; The French Guards were divided in three Squadrons, the firſt of the Genſdarmes, the ſecond the Lifeguard, and the third of the light horſemen, and two foot Bataillons, the firſt of the Kings Musketeers, and the other of the French and Switzer Guards, all in blew Caſacks.
