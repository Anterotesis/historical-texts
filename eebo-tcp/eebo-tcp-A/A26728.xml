            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54093:7"/>
I ſhall confine my diſcourſe only to that: and then the firſt thing I ſhall obſerve from my Text, is, that it is a part of an <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> ſent by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> an Apoſtolical perſon, and a man of an Apoſtolical office, whom he had ordained the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> written at ſuch a time when his <hi>departure was at hand,</hi> upon occaſion of thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which he foreſaw would afterward be brought into the Church, by thoſe that would <hi>turn away their ears from the truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> and would be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the people of <hi>itching ears,</hi> that would <hi>not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſound doctrine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> but would <hi>heap to themſelves teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after their own luſts</hi>; and the end why the Apoſtle wrote it was to forewarn him of this miſchief, and to inſtruct him what he ſhould do upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſtrengthen and incourage him, (by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his own example) againſt whatſoever he ſhould ſuffer for the performance of his duty in this particular, in <hi>preaching the word,</hi> and being <hi>inſtant in ſeaſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note> 
                     <hi>out of ſeaſon</hi>; in <hi>reproving, rebuking, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let us but look back one <hi>eight dayes,</hi> and we ſhall clearly ſee how well theſe very words would have become this Reverend perſon (whoſe Funeral hath this day occaſioned our meeting) to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to every one of us here preſent, whether Lay or Clergy; whether ſuch as are in danger to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with thoſe corruptions that are now got into the Church, (which are the very ſame for nature, and in a very high degree with thoſe that are here foretold by St. <hi>Paul</hi>) or ſuch as by their office and calling in the Church are bound to oppoſe them; ſeeing he was a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that is, a perſon of an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54093:7"/>
office, and ſuch an one, whoſe care, as well as duty it was to oppoſe and beat down whatever was contrary to <hi>ſound doctrine,</hi> and to inſtruct others what to do upon the like occaſions: and that not only by his doings, but alſo by his ſufferings, not only by his pen and preaching, but alſo by his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal and Chriſtian converſation, and that good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which he hath left us for our imitation of him both in his life and death.</p>
                  <p>Let us then ſuppoſe to our ſelves, what we may reaſonably preſume he would have ſaid to us ſo few dayes ago; or let us but imagine we hear his <hi>Hearſe</hi> preaching now to us, what he would then have taught himſelf, and what doctrine can we more likely expect from him, then what my Text will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us, if we conſider it with thoſe circumſtances I have already mentioned? Believe it, the <hi>Hearſe</hi> of a perſon of his Sacred order and Exemplary pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will be a powerful preacher to any devout ſoul, that duly conſiders it, and ſeriouſly layes it to heart; and therefore do but liſten to that as ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was ſo proper and likely for himſelf to have ſpoken, and you may have a <hi>Funeral Sermon</hi> (though I ſhould hold my peace) even from the words of my Text: <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith: Henceforth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Here is too large a task for ſo ſhort a time, as is ordinary for this exerciſe; and therefore I muſt confine my diſcourſe only to the former general part of my Text, and be brief in that too. More will not be neceſſary; for let us but take out this leſſon well, and we need not be much ſolicitous for the other; let us but carefully and conſcionably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>work,</hi> and we may ſafely truſt God for the <hi>wages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this point, that I may ſpeak clearly, as well as briefly; I ſhall conſider the words, firſt <hi>joyntly together,</hi> and then <hi>ſeverally apart,</hi> in relation to the three ſeveral actions already mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As they are taken <hi>joyntly together,</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that as very often elſewhere, ſo here in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alludeth to the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the <hi>Olympick Games</hi> among the <hi>Grecians</hi>: for my whole Text is a continued <hi>Allegory</hi> taken from thoſe ſports; and conſequently, all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal words which are in it, if we conſider them in the literal ſenſe, muſt be underſtood as terms alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>Agoniſtical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, as in thoſe <hi>Olympick Games,</hi> there were ſeveral Champions that contended in <hi>fighting,</hi> or <hi>cuffing,</hi> or <hi>wreſtling,</hi> or <hi>driving of Chariots,</hi> in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54093:9"/>
ſuch a place of ground, or upon ſuch a ſtage, for ſome <hi>Honorarie</hi> or reward (as a <hi>Crown</hi> of Olive or Lawrel or the like) before ſuch a perſon, who ſate there to judge of the ſport, and crown him that got the victory: ſo here in my Text, (1.) The <hi>Agoniſt</hi> or Champion is St. <hi>Paul</hi>: (2.) the <hi>ſtadium</hi> or place where this prize is played, is the world; (3.) the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or Combate, is his <hi>labour</hi> in the diſcharge of his <hi>Apoſtolical office,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in <hi>ſuffering perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for righteouſneſs ſake:</hi> (4.) the <hi>victory,</hi> is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over the Devil, the world, and the fleſh, the hard hearted <hi>Jews</hi> and idolatrous <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate <hi>Hereticks</hi> and perverſe <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> (5.) The <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or <hi>Reward,</hi> is that <hi>incorruptible Crown</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentioned by this Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.25. Jam. 1.12.

                  </p>
                  <p>This being premiſed, as it will adde great light to my whole Text, ſo more particularly to the two firſt particulars in the former general part of it, the Apoſtles <hi>fighting a good fight, and finiſhing his courſe.</hi> For the <hi>Olympick games</hi> conſiſted chiefly in thoſe foure kindes of ſport,<note place="margin">Alex. ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandr.

                     </note> formerly intimated, <hi>fighting, running,</hi> or Chariot-driving, <hi>wreſtling</hi> and <hi>cuffing</hi>: and the Apoſtle plainly alludeth to the two firſt of them in thoſe two actions, (my text being a perfect parallel to that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. <hi>I therefore ſo run, not as uncertainly; ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the aire:)</hi> And as for the third, that of <hi>keeping the faith,</hi> it ſignifieth nothing that is peculiar in it ſelf, but is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54093:9"/>
only a conſequent upon the two former actions by way of <hi>conſtancie</hi> and <hi>perſeverance,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having taken this ſhort view of the words joyntly together, let us now proceed to conſider them ſeverally apart; and then what we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto looked upon in the <hi>Allegory,</hi> we ſhall ſee more clearly in the <hi>moral,</hi> or ſignification of it. The acts I told you were three, whereof 1. The firſt is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> fighting, I <hi>have fought a good fight,</hi> where we may further obſerve,</p>

To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I will not diſpute, whether theſe words are to be underſtood of St. <hi>Pauls firſt anſwering</hi> for his life before <hi>Nero,</hi> (which was a thing then paſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all diſpute) or of his <hi>ſecond,</hi> which was then to come: If the former,<note place="margin">Vid.

Tom. 1. ad An. 59. num. 13, 14, 15.</note> (as ſome very learned men are of opinion it was) the doubt will quickly vaniſh of it ſelf; but ſeeing he ſpeaks of his <hi>departure</hi> as a thing then <hi>at hand,</hi> (and not at 9. or 10. years diſtance) I ſhall (for peace-ſake) take the latter as granted; and anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he had ſo good aſſurance and confidence in Gods mercy, as to his conſtancy and final perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as he looks upon the work as done already in effect, while it was but yet a doing; and himſelf as <hi>comprehenſor,</hi> while he was only <hi>viator</hi>; or as a <hi>conquerour</hi> before the fight was fully ended. <hi>Quod futurum eſſe praeſumpſit, tanquam factum fuerit judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi> ſayes the ſame Father in the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>But then for the <hi>ground</hi> of this aſſurance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to make that appear the more clearly, we muſt (as before) diſtinguiſh between the <hi>work</hi> and the <hi>wages</hi>; for theſe being at ſeveral diſtances, will require ſeveral <hi>Teleſcopes</hi> to repreſent them to our underſtanding.</p>

                  <p>All this while I have ſpoken of the ground of his confidence, and not at all of the <hi>medium,</hi> by which the evidence of what he affirmeth was conveyed to him: for whether that was a <gap reason="foreign">

by the opinion of the moſt and beſt interpreters, both <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>modern</hi>; and theſe latter again, both of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches.

                  <p>And here I know ſome will expect that I ſhould (as the manner is) give you an account of his whole life, from his cradle to his grave; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I muſt be forced to fruſtrate your expectation. Such a thing may be done where the life is but of a few years, and moſt of that life not ſo much a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> perhaps as a <hi>being</hi> in the world. But in this caſe ſuch a thing cannot be expected with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, after ſo long an exerciſe of your patience; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of how long continuance his life hath been (an hundred years wanting five) and how much of that time he hath imployed in the eminent and weighty office of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> almoſt 44. years, (in which reſpects I think he hath not left his equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him in <hi>Europe</hi>) but eſpecially conſidering that there is hardly a <hi>day</hi> in thoſe years, nor ſcarce an <hi>houre</hi> in that day, whereof ſome good account may not be given, if I ſhould go about ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſeeing I muſt of neceſſity omit much that might be ſaid in this caſe according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, I ſhall confine my diſcourſe to that which cannot be omitted without violating my Text, and prevaricating in a good cauſe. And for the reſt

                  <p>In all ages the <hi>office</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> was enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the perſon that ſuſtained it in a <hi>fight</hi> of <hi>action</hi>: and of late the very <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> was more then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54093:19"/>
enough to engage him in the <hi>fight</hi> of <hi>ſuffering</hi>: I pray God forgive them that occaſioned it. They might have foreſeen at firſt whither it naturally tended, and cannot but now ſee what it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly brought upon themſelves, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſince the quarrel was improved againſt all the other offices of Miniſtery in the Church, which at firſt was commenced only againſt the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Nay, the very Church it ſelf (if we look upon her as a branch of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſt, which we profeſs in our <hi>Creed</hi>) is now at laſt aſſaulted by thoſe that will allow of no Churches, but of their own gathering, which is a thing of more dangerous conſequence then moſt are aware of: I pray God I may be a falſe prophet in this thing, when I tell you my fears, that the end of it (if not timely prevented) is like enough to be confuſion and Atheiſm, which begin already to flow in upon us, or rather to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm us.</p>
                  <p>How worthily this our Champion hath carried himſelf in this fight, is a thing ſo well known as I ſhall not need to inlarge my diſcourſe upon it. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thoſe many learned Volumes he hath written againſt all the adverſaries of this poor afflicted Church of ours, of what party ſoever, eſpecially thoſe in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion. And the manner of his writing brings him very pertinently under the firſt branch of my Text in two ſeveral reſpects. For firſt his cuſtome was to diſarm the enemy (where poſſibly it might be done) and turn their own cannon upon them, by making uſe of their own confeſſions againſt themſelves: and ſecondly, the word <hi>fighting</hi> was in a manner peculiar to him above all other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54093:20"/>
                     <hi>polemical</hi> divines that I have ſeen, in that his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he bringeth to eſtabliſh his own cauſe, are moſt commonly concluded with a <hi>challenge</hi> to his Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>While he was thus engaged againſt a puiſſant enemy in the <hi>front,</hi> a peeviſh enemy from an ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado charged him and the reſt of his Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and fellow Champions in the <hi>Rear.</hi> I cannot but ſay he foreſaw him, becauſe it is clear he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prevent his deſign in his <hi>Book of the three Innocent Ceremonies,</hi> printed above forty years agoe: but yet I cannot deny, but if all of us had buckled our ſelves more vigorouſly againſt him before the <hi>Cockatrice egge brake out into</hi> ſuch a dangerous <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> the other Adverſary had never got half the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt us which now he hath, by making uſe of theſe as his <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> and Inſtruments. For whatſoever they may outwardly pretend, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better be reſembled to any thing then <hi>Samſons Foxes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jud. 15.4.</note> 
                     <hi>tyed by the tails, with fire-brands between them</hi>; though hitherto they look ſeveral wayes, they agree well enough to burn up all the good wheat in this field of our poor afflicted Church.</p>
                  <p>How careful this our Champion was to ſuppreſs this Monſter before it was perfectly fledged, will appear by two Excellent <hi>Sermons</hi> of his now in print: the one preached with great applauſe at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> (on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.) before it had got the wing over <hi>Tweed</hi>; and the other with no leſs, ſince that time, in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>London</hi>: (on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.) In the former whereof he teacheth the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>ſubjects</hi> towards their undoubted <hi>Soveraign</hi>; and in the latter, the duty of <hi>all Chriſtians</hi> towards
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54093:20"/>
their lawful Superiours in the Church; the want of which two duties hath opened thoſe two great ſluces of <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Schiſme,</hi> which then began to flow in upon us, and ſince that time have almoſt utterly drowned us.</p>
                  <p>It is the part of a good ſouldier when he findes his firſt deſigne not like to take the effect he deſireth, to have another in <hi>reſerve</hi>; and our Champion was not wanting in this neither: for when the <hi>Pulpit</hi> was ſhut againſt him, he put on a ſtronger reſolution to ſupply that in private with his <hi>Pen,</hi> which he was not ſuffered to perform in publick with his <hi>tongue.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Printed at Oxford. <hi>1644.</hi>
                     </note> And to this we owe that little Treatiſe of his (though prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without his name) intituled <hi>Confeſsions and Proofs,</hi> &amp;c. which he compiled from the ſuffrages of the moſt learned Proteſtants of forraign <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> in defence of the ſacred order of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and which he hath ſince enlarged, and fitted for a ſecond Impreſſion: I wiſh I could ſay the like for two other litle Treatiſes, which were deſigned by him, but not brought to perfection, the one in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Infants Baptiſme,</hi> the other againſt the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous doctrine of the <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Printed Books are ſo well known to the world, as I need not ſpeak of them; and therefore I have brought theſe inſtances out of his papers, that I may tell you ſomething more then the world knowes of him.</p>
                  <p>All that I ſhall need to adde is, that while he was engaged in theſe conflicts, he was again alarm'd by a nameleſs Romiſh Adverſary, with a mask of <hi>J. S.</hi> before his face, and the title of <hi>Anti-Mortonus</hi> before his Book; whereunto he had prepared a full
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54093:21"/>
and large Anſwer about a dozen years ago; though ſince that time (by ſome miſadventure or other) I finde thoſe papers have loſt much of their former perfection.</p>
                  <p>In theſe quarrels was he engaged, and charged thus by ſeveral adverſaries both in the <hi>front</hi> and <hi>rear,</hi> for very many years after his age had exceeded holy <hi>Davids ſpan</hi>;<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.6.</note> even for a good many years after it was paſt <hi>foureſcore,</hi> when (in the Holy dialect) our <hi>ſtrength is nothing but labour and ſorrow</hi>;<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.10.</note> inſomuch as (excepting one litle Treatiſe of <hi>Gods providence</hi> in his Meditations upon the viſion of <hi>Ezekiels wheeles)</hi> we may ſay he dyed in the field, though he was not vanquiſhed.<note place="margin">Sueton. &amp; Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philin. in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſ.</note> 
                     <hi>Mori potuit, ſuccumbere non potuit.</hi> That ſaying of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> [<hi>oportet imperatorem ſtantem mori</hi>] may very properly be accommodated to this our Champion, who <hi>fought a good fight</hi> and <hi>kept the faith</hi> till he had <hi>finiſhed his courſe</hi> here upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>All this while I have inſtanced only in thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts which he undertook in matters of <hi>Doctrine</hi>; but to make up a compleat Chriſtian ſouldier, there will be requiſite ſome <hi>perfection of manners,</hi> as well as <hi>integrity of faith</hi>; but much more to make up a good <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And this appeared in him very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly through the whole <hi>courſe</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> and will bring in the ſecond Act of St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioned here in my Text.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe</hi>: upon which words I might have juſt occaſion to ſpeak of the whole <hi>courſe</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> during the whole time of his pilgrimage here upon earth, but only that it is a task much too large either for my time or your patience.</p>
                  <p>It might perhaps be ſome ſatisfaction to your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54093:21"/>
                     <hi>curioſity,</hi> but little advantage to your <hi>edification,</hi> to tell you either the place of his <hi>birth,</hi> or of his <hi>educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or of his ſeveral <hi>offices and dignities</hi> in the Church: but to tell you how much he adorned the place of his <hi>birth,</hi> and how much he profited under thoſe from whom he had his <hi>education,</hi> and how well he diſcharged himſelf in thoſe ſeveral <hi>places and offices</hi> he ſuſtained in the Church, this may and will be much more uſeful to us.</p>
                  <p>And theſe three have ſuch immediate dependence one upon another, that I need but ſpeak of one of them for all. For the good <hi>diſcharge of his offices</hi> in the Church declareth how much he profited by his good <hi>education,</hi> and both of theſe together will make a new addition of honour to the place of his <hi>Birth,</hi> (the City of <hi>YORK</hi>) though that hath been very famous for many generations.</p>
                  <p>I do not now ſpeak of his great <hi>learning,</hi> whereof I have given you ſo many inſtances already, but of his ſingular <hi>piety</hi> and exquiſite carriage in matters of <hi>Morality,</hi> which he expreſſed in a <hi>grave, virtuous</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> converſation, attended with much ſweetneſs and affability all his life long. And in this he was ſo eminent, that none of his greateſt Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries (and many great ones he hath had) could ever affix any reproach upon him for any defect in this particular; though their eyes were ſharp enough to pry into his actions, and their mouthes wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cenſure them, if it had been in the power of malice to have done it.</p>
                  <p>To ſay he had no failings, were to deny he was a man: and I knew him ſo well, as I could expect but ſmall thanks from him if he were alive, if I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54093:22"/>
ſhould deifie him now he is dead; nor could I hope to finde credence from you in what I ſay of him, if I ſhould ſpeak any thing that might juſtly be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted a flattering of his memory. But however this I dare boldly ſay of him, that no man I ever knew was more excuſable in his failings then he was. For if we reduce them to their true original, it will prove to be, that he was ſo clear and upright in his own <hi>conſcience</hi> as to think every man truly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious</hi> that pretended to be ſo: he was ſo real a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> himſelf, as made him unwilling to believe there was ſuch a thing as an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in the world.</p>
                  <p>When I have ſaid this I have prevented all that <hi>calumny</hi> it ſelf can object againſt him: and that will cut off much that would otherwiſe be neceſſary to have ſpoken of him. For this one rub being removed, the whole courſe of his life was ſo ſmooth in a <hi>godly, righteous,</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> converſation, as will render him truly one of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Diſciples; and <hi>ſucceſſour</hi> in <hi>virtue</hi> as well in <hi>office</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> the <hi>firſt Biſhop of Crete</hi>; whom this great Apoſtle inſtructeth to <hi>live ſoberly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>righteouſly and godly in this preſent world:</hi> 1. <hi>Soberly,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>himſelf</hi>: 2. <hi>Righteouſly,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men; and 3. <hi>Godly,</hi> in relation to God Almighty. This was the holy Apoſtles precept, and this was the Reverend Biſhops practiſe; I mean the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>DURESME,</hi> as well as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>CRETE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He lived <hi>ſoberly,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>himſelf.</hi> His <hi>meat</hi> was neither much nor delicate, his <hi>drink</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong nor plentiful; and never between meals, till infirmities of age made it neceſſary for him. And as for his <hi>cloathes</hi> they were alwayes as mean, as were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54093:22"/>
worn by any man of his rank and quality whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and he ſeldome had any change, for when he made any new, he uſually gave the old ones away.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe he was ſo far from the leaſt degree of curioſitie, even then when he ſeemed to repreſent the perſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as <hi>Aaron,</hi> when his <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall</hi> office was attended with a kind of <hi>Temporal</hi> principality; that he never troubled his thoughts either with <hi>what he ſhould eat, or drink,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Mat. 6.32.</note> 
                     <hi>or wherewith he ſhould be clothed,</hi> nor knew what it would be, till ſuch time as his ſervants had provided it for him: and then that which was courſeſt was moſt welcome to himſelf, though his hoſpitable table abounded with all manner of varieties, when the qualitie of the perſons he entertained did require it.</p>
                  <p>His ordinary ſaying was that the beſt <hi>Rule</hi> for diet was to obſerve <hi>none at all</hi>: but yet the moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe which he uſed, was to eat but once a day. He lived a very great number of years, and very few ever husbanded their time better, for he was never idle with his good will:<note place="margin">Wiſd. 4.13.</note> ſo that if a man may be ſaid to <hi>fulfil a long time,</hi> that improves his time well though he die young: how long may we ſay did he live that numbred ſo many years, and miſpent ſo little time as he did? He was often up at his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtudy before four a clock, even after he had lived above <hi>fourſcore</hi> years; and yet very ſeldome went to bed till after ten, and then had alwayes a ſervant to read ſome Book to him, till ſuch time as ſleep did ſurprize him: and ſo had he alwayes when he travelled in his Coach, that his journey might not be too great a hinderance to his ſtudy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He lived <hi>Righteouſly</hi> towards all men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54093:23"/>
out doing the leaſt wrong to any, even then when the advantages he had to do it, added much force to the ſtrength of the Temptation; when his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power in <hi>Temporal</hi> as well as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> affairs within the <hi>County palatine</hi> of <hi>DURESME,</hi> might have afforded him very many opportunities to be partial to ſome, and oppreſs others. I have often heard him ſpeak it with much thankfulneſs to God that he could ſay with <hi>Samuel</hi> in the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his heart;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſe Oxe have I taken? Or whoſe Aſſe have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppreſſed? Or of whoſe hand have I received a bribe to blinde mine eyes therewith</hi>?</p>
                  <p>And in this we may the more eaſily believe him, when we conſider his great <hi>equitie</hi> and <hi>liberality</hi>: for <hi>equitie</hi> is <hi>correctio juris legitimi,</hi> a ſelf denial in his own right, and <hi>liberality</hi> is the giving away his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. The former he practiſed ordinarily in <hi>Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, Wracks,</hi> and <hi>Deodands,</hi> and upon ſeveral other occaſions: rather then any man ſhould think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aggrieved by him, he would be the loſer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he never was <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> in any Law ſuit but once, and then let the Action fall when he ſaw the Declaration drawn up ſo far above the truth. And then again for his <hi>liberalitie</hi> (which implieth his <hi>righteous dealing à fortiore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.6.</note> and will <hi>make</hi> it <hi>as clear as the light,</hi> without all diſpute) it was ſo great, as he never cared for money, but to give away, or do ſome other good with it, as all thoſe that knew him can abundantly teſtifie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>lived Godly in this preſent world.</hi> His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was ſuch for piety and devotion, as well became a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Biſhop</hi>: his <hi>faſting,</hi> his <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54093:23"/>
his <hi>Alms</hi> and other exerciſes of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> were both frequent and affectionate. He would often forgoe, or at leſt much moderate, that one meal a day, which he ordinarily allowed himſelf: he would often denie himſelf ſome part of that pittance of time which ſhould have been for his ſleep, to riſe up out of his bed and ſpend in <hi>Prayer,</hi> as I have heard from thoſe that attended him in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And as for his <hi>Alms-giving</hi> while he was ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enjoy his Eſtate he had his <hi>Beads-men</hi> in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> at a conſtant Table, beſide what he gave away at his Gate, and upon other occaſions. Nay, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant was he in this duty, even then when he had hardly ſo much left as to afford bread for his own mouth, that he had alwayes a certain number of poor impotent perſons in conſtant penſion, that came weekly to him for a plentiful allowance when he was not able himſelf to goe among them to give it: and this will be abundantly teſtified by the <hi>Poor</hi> in all places where (of late) he hath lived.</p>
                  <p>And then for his ſeverity to himſelf, by way of outward <hi>Mortification,</hi> it was ſo great (though much concealed) as few of his Adverſaries (even thoſe that pretend to make it their work) will be found to go beyond him. It will hardly finde a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellel in this nice and delicate age wherein we live, that a perſon who had lived ſo many years in ſuch great plenty and honour as he did, ſhould lie upon his <hi>ſtraw-bed,</hi> even then when he was above <hi>fourſcore years</hi> of age; and would not be perſwaded from it till <hi>Cramps</hi> and other infirmities compell'd him to it.</p>
                  <p>In this alſo he was a true diſciple of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.3.</note> who had taught him by precept to <hi>endure hardneſs as a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54093:24"/>
good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and by his own example, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. ult.</note> 
                     <hi>to keep under his body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt when he had preached to others, himſelf ſhould become a reprobate.</hi> So that hence you may clearly ſee how true a Diſciple of this great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> this Reverend perſon hath been in all his <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> both as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and as a <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And I could ſhew you the like of his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> if the work were not too hazardous as well as too great for this time. For <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Paſsion</hi> are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> terms; the one cannot be truly underſtood without reflecting upon the other: and therefore I muſt forbear to ſpeak of his <hi>Chriſtian ſufferings,</hi> that I may the better conceal the <hi>unchriſtian doings</hi> of them that brought thoſe <hi>ſufferings</hi> upon him.</p>
                  <p>All that I ſhall ſay in this particular is this, (wherein I cannot wrong his <hi>Reverend brethren</hi> ſo much as ſingle him altogether from them) that when the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren</hi> had got a permiſſion to vent his whole malice in Calumniating the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of this poor afflicted Church,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.10.</note> he could not lay any <hi>perſonal fault</hi> to the charge of any one of them: all that he could object againſt them, was either their <hi>office</hi> as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or that wherewith he deluded the giddy multitude to think was a failing in the exerciſe of that office, though now it is evident to moſt men that will be content to lay aſide their groundleſs jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, that it was a timely foreſight of that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief (and a providential care to ſuppreſs it) which we now ſee when it is too late hath almoſt utterly ruined this once flouriſhing Church.</p>
                  <p>But as for this Reverend <hi>Biſhop</hi> in particular, there was never any thing laid to his charge by thoſe that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54093:24"/>
brought his <hi>ſufferings</hi> upon him, but only that he was a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And whatſoever he ſuffered upon that account (he well knew) was not <hi>for evil doing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 S. Pet. 3.17.</note> but <hi>for conſcience towards God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">—2.19.</note> and conſequently <hi>for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake</hi>; which made him with St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

Witneſs his late <hi>Ordinations</hi> of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> here among you, whereof ſome here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent received the benefit, and many more can give the teſtimony: and wherein he was ſo exceeding careful, when he durſt not truſt either his <hi>eyes</hi> or his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54093:25"/>
                     <hi>memory,</hi> that he gave the words of <hi>benediction,</hi> as they were read unto him by ſome of thoſe that aſſiſted him in thoſe ſolemn offices.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Witneſs alſo his great care and earneſt prayers (of which likewiſe there be ſeveral witneſſes here preſent) that the ſacred <hi>order and ſucceſsion of Biſhops</hi> might never fail in this poor afflicted and diſtreſſed Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Witneſs likewiſe his very great and high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the ſacred <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which I may juſtly ſay attended him to his very grave, and did not expire with his breath. For I had an expreſs and particular command from him, not to omit, nor ſo much as tranſpoſe, (as he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved too frequently to be done by others) the reading of the Leſſon (taken out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) which the Church hath preſcribed to be read at the <hi>Grave:</hi> and which being read there, while the mouth of the grave is open upon thoſe that hear it, and while ſuch a ſpectacle of mortality is before their eyes, (he ſaid) could not but have a greater influence upon their ſouls, then any Funeral Sermon he had ever heard preached.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Witneſs moreover his exceeding great <hi>fervour and devotion in prayer,</hi> whereunto he ſeldome anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a ſingle [<hi>Amen</hi>;] and at which duty he never kneeled upon a Quſhion (I think) in all his life, nor ever prayed but upon his knees, till he was confined to his death-bed: and even then, would never lie with his Cap on his head, if he either prayed himſelf or any other prayed by him, while he had ſtrength to pull it off with his own hands.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Witneſs (laſtly) that great <hi>conſolation</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> which he had and uſed, in partaking the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54093:25"/>
comforts of the Church to prepare him for his long journey. I ſpeak not only in reſpect of the <hi>Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> it ſelf, as his <hi>viaticum</hi>; but alſo of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives which he uſed before it, in the preſence of many who are now here preſent, as to the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>Faith,</hi> the ſtirring up of his <hi>hope,</hi> and the exerciſe (1.) of his <hi>charity</hi> in forgiving all that ever had done him any wrong; (2.) of his <hi>humility</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring all men to forgive him, though he could not remember he had wronged any: (3.) and laſt of all of his <hi>repentance,</hi> wherein he was ſo exact and punctual, as not to neglect that great benefit and comfort, which every truly pious and humble ſoul doth reap from the <hi>Keyes of the Church,</hi> in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>abſolution</hi> duly performed, which he both deſired and received. And when he had been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of theſe comforts himſelf, he made all thoſe that aſſiſted him in them, partakers of his <hi>Bleſsing</hi> upon them, and <hi>prayers</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p>It is an infallible ſign the ſoil is good, when the <hi>ſeed</hi> that is <hi>ſown</hi> doth not only <hi>forthwith ſpring up,</hi>

                        <hi>S.</hi> Mat. 13.5.</note> as that did which <hi>fell upon ſtony places,</hi> but alſo <hi>bringeth forth fruit with patience in an honeſt and good heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Luke 8.15.</note> as that did which <hi>fell upon the good ground,</hi> and as the caſe was here. For he did not only <hi>receive the ſeed with joy</hi> for the preſent, but retained it with much <hi>comfort</hi> in the time of his greateſt <hi>temptation,</hi> even to the very laſt gaſp which was two dayes after. For while he was able to ſpeak, he teſtified the <hi>fruit</hi> of it by his <hi>words,</hi> and acknowledged his thankfullneſs to God for it, and the <hi>unworthy</hi> inſtrument that reached it to him, and to all that any way aſſiſted him in it: and even after his ſpeech failed him, he ſignified
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54093:26"/>
with his <hi>hand</hi> his aſſent to what was ſpoken to him, or prayed for him: and I doubt not but his <hi>Devotion,</hi> as well as his <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> continued as long as his breath, though neither his tongue nor hand could (at laſt) expreſs it.</p>
                  <p>I need not inſiſt any longer upon theſe paſſages at his death, though they be very excellent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, becauſe many here preſent were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of them. I have been thus particular for their ſakes, who had not the happineſs to be then with him, that they may learn, by ſo good an example, what it is to <hi>have a ſoul within them,</hi> and a <hi>God above them</hi>: and with what care and courage they ought both to <hi>fight</hi> and to <hi>run,</hi> and with what conſtancy to <hi>continue</hi> in both, till they alſo obtain that <hi>Crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> which <hi>henceforth is laid up for him</hi> in the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And that we may all of us be <hi>followers of him</hi> in theſe duties as he was of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and both of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I beſeech you ſuffer one word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> by way of <hi>Application to our ſelves,</hi> (which was the third and laſt way wherein I propoſed to handle my Text) and then I ſhall diſmiſs you.</p>
                  <p>And in this I ſhall keep my ſelf ſo cloſe to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, as not to uſe any other motives to you, then what St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth to his Diſciple <hi>Timothy</hi> for the imbracing of this doctrine, in the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before my Text:<note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> 
                     <hi>I am ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</hi> For (1.) if this was ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful an argument to perſwade <hi>Timothy</hi> to be <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> to <hi>endure afflictions,</hi> and to <hi>fulfil his Miniſtrie</hi>: and again (2.) if it was ſo ſtrong a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive wherewith to forewarn the <hi>people</hi> to walk wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54093:26"/>
in thoſe approaching evil times, wherein men <hi>will not endure ſound doctrine,</hi>

                     <hi>but after their own luſts heap to themſelves teachers, having itching ears</hi>: Then ſurely it cannot but have ſome influence upon every one of us, (whether <hi>Lay or Clergie</hi>) that hath any care or ſenſe of his ſoul and eternal ſalvation, ſo as to work in us a ſincere endeavour to perform thoſe duties which are here required of us reſpectively by this great <hi>Apoſtle</hi>; when we ſeriouſly lay to heart, that not only St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but this Reverend <hi>Biſhop</hi> alſo, are not only <hi>ready to be offered,</hi> but are offered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that <hi>the time</hi> of their <hi>departure is</hi> not only <hi>at hand,</hi> but actually paſt, now when we are already fallen into thoſe <hi>perillous times,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this place did only foreſee at a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave (I beſeech you) yet a little more diſtinctly to apply my motives ſeverally to the <hi>Lay</hi> and <hi>Clergie</hi> here preſent. And firſt for you (my Reverend Brethren of the <hi>Clergie,</hi>) let me deſire you to mark well the <hi>force</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles argument</hi> to his Deſciple <hi>Timothy: I am ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand,</hi> ſo that hereafter thou canſt not have either my <hi>counſel, direction</hi> or <hi>aſsiſtance</hi>; and therefore do <hi>thou watch in all things,</hi> &amp;c. which is as if he ſhould have ſaid, the duty which hitherto hath been required from us both, will hereafter lye wholly upon thee alone to perform; and therefore be thou the more careful to uſe double diligence in the performance of it. Let us (of the <hi>Clergie</hi>) I ſay, but take the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> argument in this ſenſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly lay it to heart; and then without all doubt it will pinch us to the quick, when we conſider how great a blow it was to a <hi>tottering Church,</hi> to have ſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54093:27"/>
great a <hi>pillar</hi> removed from it, as this learned and laborious <hi>Biſhop</hi> was. Certainly now is the time, and this the occaſion (if ever) when we muſt <hi>watch in all things,</hi> and pray unto Almighty God for his <hi>grace</hi> to enable us to <hi>fulfil our Miniſterie,</hi> and his ſtrength to fit us for <hi>enduring afflictions.</hi> And more particularly to <hi>lift up our prayers for the remnant that is left.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. And then again (Right honourable, and the reſt my dearly beloved brethren of the <hi>Layty</hi>) let me apply my diſcourſe in one word unto you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you alſo to mark well the force of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument to <hi>Timothy</hi> in theſe words: <hi>I am ready to be offered</hi> my ſelf, and yet <hi>the time will come when they will not endure ſound doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.

God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>preach the word,</hi> and <hi>to be inſtant in ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>out of ſeaſon</hi>; ſo is it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable I ſhould give it thee now when <hi>the time of my departure is at hand</hi>; that as the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>charge</hi> preſſeth <hi>thee,</hi> ſo the <hi>ſeaſonableneſs</hi> of it may have the better influence upon the <hi>people</hi> to whom thou art ſent. As if he ſhould have ſaid: though the duty be great which the people are to learn from thee, yet it will be the more willingly liſtened unto, if thou doeſt tell them <hi>I left it in charge with thee</hi> at this very inſtant when the <hi>time of my departure is at hand,</hi> ſeeing the words of a dying man are ſo ſtrong and powerful. Let them therefore know, that this is my laſt exhortation to them; and then they will the more eaſily ſuppoſe me as preſent with them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this doctrine is preached unto them.</p>
                  <p>And if we look upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> argument under this conſideration, I have ſtill one parallel behind between him and this Reverend <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which is fetcht not only from the words of a <hi>Dying man,</hi> but even of a <hi>dead man</hi>: and if the <hi>Rich mans Logick</hi> was good, when he deſired <hi>Father Abraham</hi> to <hi>ſend La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus to his Fathers houſe,</hi> to <hi>preach to his five brethren</hi>;<note place="margin">St. Luke 16.27, 28, 30.</note> becauſe if <hi>one</hi> ſhould <hi>come unto them from the dead, they would repent</hi>; I cannot but hope that what I have yet to ſay in the perſon of this dead Prelate, will have ſo much influence upon you all (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Laity</hi>) as not to return without ſome fruit.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I have done with my own <hi>Sermon,</hi> (it is more then time I ſhould) but I have ſtill another to preach to you from this Reverend <hi>Biſhop</hi>; and in this I can eaſily preſume upon your patience, though I have almoſt wearied it already. When I call this a

                     </note> I ſpeak not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my warrant.

                        <p n="7">7.

And I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuſtained the burthen of that Office
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54093:30"/>
above 40, years in the Church, if this had not been alwayes my judgment concerning <hi>Biſhops.</hi> I pray God reſtore them again to thoſe poor afflicted parts of his Church where either the Office or the Exerciſe of it is wanting.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath any more power over <hi>Biſhops</hi> then other <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> and <hi>Patriarcks</hi> have in their ſeveral Sees reſpectively, is a thing which I have often and largely diſproved in my writings. All that the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> did allow him was a <hi>priority of order,</hi> but no ſupreamacie of Monarchical power. And I heartily wiſh that this, and all other differences now on foot between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> might be decided by the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for the <hi>firſt five hundred years</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, for that hath been my deſign in all my writings.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. If I had not believed upon ſufficient evidence, that the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had been legally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I had never entred into that high calling, much leſs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it thus long. And therefore I muſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54093:31"/>
here expreſly vindicate my ſelf from a moſt notorious <hi>untruth</hi> which is caſt upon me by a late <hi>Romiſh writer,</hi> That I ſhould publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the <hi>Houſe of Peers,</hi> the beginning of the laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> aſſent to that abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fiction which ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed concerning the Conſecrating <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> at the <hi>Nags-head Tavern</hi> to be <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>: for I do here ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs, I have alwayes believed that Fable to proceed from the <hi>Father of lyes,</hi> as the publick Records ſtill extant do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently teſtifie. Nor do I remember that ever I heard it mentioned in that or any other <hi>Parliament</hi> that ever I ſate in.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. As for our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Protestants</hi> of forraign <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> the moſt learned and judicious of themſelves have bewailed their miſerie for want of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> And therefore God forbid I ſhould be ſo uncharitable as to cenſure them for <hi>No-Churches,</hi> for that which is their <hi>Infelicity,</hi> not their <hi>fault.</hi> But as for our <hi>perverſe Proteſtants</hi> at home, I cannot ſay the ſame of them, ſeeing they impiouſly reject that which the other piouſly deſire. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54093:31"/>
therefore I cannot flatter thoſe in this Church who have received their <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> only from <hi>meer Presbyters,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Quid enim facit exceptâ ordinatione E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus, quod Presbyter non facit. S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Ep. ad Euagr.</hi>

                        <p n="12">12. Whereſoever there is a <hi>formed Church,</hi> there muſt of necſſity be ſome <hi>ſet form of Gods worſhip</hi>; Otherwiſe it will quickly fall in peices, as wofull experience hath taught us.

the <hi>Leiturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> both for <hi>decency edification</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> in all the ſeverall offices of it. If the <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> themſelves that firſt laid it aſide, could have found any faults in it, their modeſty was not ſo great, (if we may judge of it by their other actions,) as to have conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from the world.</p>
                        <p n="13">13.

                        </p>
                        <p n="14">14. But yet my <hi>common charity</hi> to them muſt not ſuperſede my more <hi>particular love and obligation</hi> which I have to thoſe truly humble and meek ſoules in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (and more eſpecially in my own

                  <p n="7">7. And in what I ſay of him I ſhall keep my ſelf to the exact rule of <hi>truth,</hi> both for his ſake, and my own, and the Readers, and the end I cheifly aime
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54093:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at; without either flattering his memory, or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe paſſages of his life which may cheifly qualify his example for our imitation. Only I muſt beg my Readers pardon, if the length of his life, and multitude of his imployments, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his learning, and chriſtian concealement of much of his piety, neceſſitate me to omit many things I could not learn, and paſs over ſomethings I know, and fall much below his merit in what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for brevities ſake.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Having premiſed thus much, I preſume the Reader will expect no <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> but only a bare, (and that alſo a ſhort,) <hi>narrative</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> for the information of poſterity and conviction of his enemies, rather then for any ſolace to his friends, who could not but know him well enough, ſeeing he was a <hi>burning and ſhining light,</hi> for ſo great a number of yeares here amongſt us. And what I ſay ſhall for methods ſake be reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A plain <hi>Narrative</hi> of the principall paſſages in his <hi>Life.</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54093:38"/>
before he aſcended to any conſiderable eminency in the Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I am inforced to fetch my compaſs thus far about, (and when I have done to ſit down with probabilities,) by his great modeſty and humility, who would not receive, nor ſo much as look upon, a very fair and large <hi>deſcent</hi> of his <hi>Pedigree,</hi> when it was preſented unto him, though he liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the perſon that preſented it. And therefore I ſhall ſay no more concerning his progenitors, and had not ſaid thus much but that his <hi>Seall at Armes</hi> will warrant me in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The place of his Birth was the antient and famous City of <hi>YORK,</hi> where <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Father of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great died in the armes of his Son, and where (ſome ſay) the ſaid <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour was born: perhaps we muſt underſtand it, as <hi>Emperour,</hi> rather then as <hi>Conſtantine</hi>; for queſtionleſs he was there firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Emperour.</hi> I might ſay more for the honour of that City, but only that it is unneceſſary, as well as extrinſecall to the ſubject of my writing who needs no ſuch advantages to add any luſter to him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. His Parents were Mr. <hi>Richard Morton</hi> Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and Mercer of <hi>York,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Leedale</hi> his wife, who inriched the <hi>World</hi> with him on <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 20. of <hi>March, Anno. Dom.</hi> 1564. He being the <hi>Sixth</hi> Child of <hi>Ninteen</hi> begotten and born of the ſame Parents. His <hi>Father</hi> was ſo eminent in his calling, that there is not at this day, nor hath been for many yeares by paſt, any <hi>Mercer</hi> in that City, who were not his Apprentices either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54093:38"/>
or mediatly. His <hi>Mother</hi> alſo was a Gentlewoman of a very good family, deſcended from the <hi>Valvaſours</hi> by her Mothers ſide: And by whom not only the <hi>Valvaſours</hi> but the <hi>Langdales</hi> alſo, and other Gentlemen of eminent worth in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> acknowledged themſelves to be of his kindred.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nor were his Parents leſs memorable for their <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> then for theſe outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: One fruit whereof we have in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Children, though I ſhall inſtance only in him of whom I now write; Who by their care and providence was brought up in <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>learning</hi>; Firſt <hi>at York</hi> under Mr. <hi>Pullen,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Hallifax</hi> under Mr. <hi>Maud,</hi> of whom he alwayes ſpake with great reverence, as a grave man and a good Scholemaſter.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It would be too great a digreſſion to ſpeak of his <hi>Scholefellowes,</hi> whom we may preſume to be ſome better ſome worſe. Otherwiſe I might menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir. <hi>Thomas Cheek</hi> on the one ſide, (not long ſince deceaſed,) venerable for his great worth and Age; and <hi>Guy Faux</hi> on the other infamous for his <hi>Dark lanthorn</hi> and villanous intention to blow up the King and Parliament in the <hi>Pouder treaſon,</hi> both which were his Schole-fellowes at <hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. How well he profited in learning, both at Schole, and in the Univerſity, will appear by his own writings without my obſervation.<note place="margin">

                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54093:39"/>
that <hi>from the time of his firſt capacity of learning he out-ſtripped even thoſe that were his ſuperiors in age, both in excellency of parts, proficiency in learning, and maturity of morall virtues</hi>: Yet was he not, (as the fault is too common,) caſt as an abortive, either out of the Schole into the Univerſity, or out of the Univerſity into the Church. For he took root in the Nurſerie at <hi>Hallifax</hi> till the Eighteenth year of his age, before he was tranſplanted into the garden of the Univerſity.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But in the year 1582. he was ſent to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and there admitted into St. <hi>Johns College,</hi> wherein were ſo many Eminent Scholers at that time,<note place="margin">

His firſt Tutour was Mr. <hi>Anthony Higgon,</hi> afterward <hi>Dean of Rippon,</hi> a good Benefactour to the College otherwayes, and in him not only to the College but alſo to the Univerſity, and the whole Church of Chriſt. But he being called out of the College to other more weighty imployments in the Church, left this his Pupill to the Tuition and care of Mr. <hi>Henry Nelſon,</hi> afterward Rector of <hi>Hougham</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> who lived to ſee his Pupill paſs through all the other <hi>Dignities</hi> he had in the Church till he came to be <hi>Biſhop of Dureſme,</hi> and a good many yeares after.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But I ſhall proceed in due order: In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>November,</hi> 1584. he was choſen <hi>Scholar of the Houſe</hi> into a place <hi>of Conſtables foundation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Regiſt. Coll.</note> (as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54093:39"/>

                     <p n="10">10. He continued his ſtudies in the <hi>College</hi> at his Fathers Charge, after he was <hi>Maſter of Arts</hi> above two years.<note place="margin">Regiſt.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54093:40"/>
his worth, againſt eight <hi>Competitors</hi> for the place, who were otherwiſe all as capable of it as he, and moſt of them better befriended: Which he was wont to recount with greater contentment to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then his advancement to any dignity he ever enjoyed in the Church. And about the ſame time he was choſen <hi>Logick Lecturer</hi> for the <hi>Univerſity</hi>: Which place he diſcharged with much art and diligence, as may appear by his <hi>Lectures</hi> fair writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which I find among his papers after his death.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. And now having laid ſo good a foundation in <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> we may look upon him in the next place as a <hi>builder in Gods Church.</hi> And for his qualifying thereunto, he did not, (as is now too frequent,) run before he was duly called and ſent, but according to the method of holy Church, was admitted to the ſacred order, firſt of <hi>Deacon,</hi> in the ſame year 1592. and the next year after of <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> by <hi>Richard Howland</hi> then Lord <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> who had formerly been Maſter of the ſame <hi>College</hi> whereof he then was <hi>Fellow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Having thus received his commiſſion from God and his Church, he was very ready to aſſiſt others in the way of <hi>Charity</hi>; but not too forward to take upon himſelf a particular <hi>cure of ſoules.</hi> And accordingly we find him for about five yeares after this, continuing in the College, proſecuting his own privat ſtudie: and reading to ſuch young Scholars as were committed to his care and <hi>Tuition.</hi>

And to that end he had alwayes ſome perſon to be his aſſiſtent, whom he knew to be pious and learned, as Mr. <hi>John Price,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Matthew Levet,</hi> who were both formerly his Pupills in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the former after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a <hi>prebendary</hi> of <hi>Leichfeild,</hi> the later of <hi>Dureſme,</hi> and alſo <hi>Subdean</hi> of <hi>Rippon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. And this aſſiſtence was the more neceſſary becauſe his great parts and worth would not ſuffer him to enjoy his privacy in a Country cure. For firſt he was made choyce of by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> then <hi>Lord Preſident</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> to be his Chaplain, for his dexterity and accuteneſs in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with the Romiſh Recuſants: For it was <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> expreſs command to him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them by arguments rather then ſuppreſs them by force, and this ſhe expreſſed, (as his Lord-ſhip was wont to ſay,) in the words of the Prophet: <hi>Nolo mortem peccatoris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. But the Earle dying preſently after, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to his privacy, at <hi>Marſton,</hi> where he continued not long before the <hi>Lord Sheffeild,</hi> (who ſucceeded as Lord preſident,) commanded him to hold a publick <hi>Conference</hi> before his Lord-ſhip, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54093:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Councell at the Manner houſe in <hi>York,</hi> with two <hi>Romiſh Recuſants</hi> who were then priſoners in the Caſtle, the one was Mr. <hi>Young</hi> a Prieſt, the other Mr. <hi>Stillington</hi> a Lay-man; Which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great ſatisfaction to the Auditory, among whom were many of the chief <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>York-ſhire.</hi> I have heard there is ſtill in ſome mens hands a true relation of that conferrence in writing; But he would never ſuffer it to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe he and his Adverſaries engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by mutuall promiſe, not to Print it but by common conſent, which he never could obtain from them, though he earneſtly deſired and ſought it.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. In the year 1602. began the great Plague at <hi>York,</hi> at which time he carryed himſelf with ſo much heroicall charity as will make the Reader wonder to hear it. For the poorer ſort being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the <hi>Peſt-houſe,</hi> he made it his frequent exerciſe to viſit them with food, both for their bodys and ſoules. His chief errand was to inſtruct and comfort them, and pray for them and with them, and to make his coming the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he carried uſually a ſack of proviſion with him for thoſe that wanted it. And becauſe he would have no man to run any hazard thereby but himſelf, he ſeldom ſuffered any of his ſervants to come near him, but ſadled and unſadled his own Horſe, and had a private door made on purpoſe into his houſe and chamber.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The next year following, the <hi>Lord Ever</hi> being ſent <hi>Embaſſadour extraordinary</hi> by <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> both to the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>

he made choyce of him, and Mr. <hi>Richard Crakanthorp,</hi> (famous alſo for his learned works in Print,) to be his Chaplaines. And Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> being deſirous to improve himſelf by ſeeing forraigne Kingdomes, Churches and Univerſities, did willingly accept of the employment.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. He had leave from the Lord Embaſſadour while he ſtayed at <hi>Breme</hi> to viſit ſome of the chief Cityes and Univerſityes of <hi>High Germany.</hi> In which travell, while he was at <hi>Mentz</hi> he fell into a very familiar acquaintance with Father <hi>Mulhuſinus,</hi> a learned <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> (who gave him a Book of his own writing, inſcribed with his own hand <hi>pro Domino Mortono,</hi>) and alſo with <hi>Nicholas Serarius,</hi> another learned Father of the ſame Society, and <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>College</hi> there, (who afterward mentioned him with civility in a Book he wrot againſt <hi>Joſeph Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>) Both theſe were ſo well ſatisfied with his learning and piety, as to treat him with much courteſy while he ſtayed there, and to deſire his prayers when he departed thence, and that <hi>ex animo</hi> too, when he preſſed them to know whether it was not merely out of civility and complement. I cannot ſay he found <hi>Beccanus</hi> in the contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at <hi>Colen,</hi> though he left him ſo. For being gaulled with ſome Arguments in a diſputation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he ſleighted his <hi>prayers</hi> as of one whom he miſcalled an <hi>Heretick.</hi> I only inſtance in this, to ſhew that many learned men of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and ſome even of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> order,) do not in their hearts and privat diſcourſes condemne us of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                     <p n="20">20. At his return he was ſollicited by <hi>Roger Earle</hi> of <hi>Rutland</hi> to be his domeſticall <hi>Chaplain.</hi> Which profer he was the more willing to accept for the privacy he hoped to enjoy in a place where he was not known, for making uſe of that Treaſure of <hi>Bookes</hi> he had got in his travells: And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe thereby he was brought ſo much nearer to <hi>London</hi> then before, whither he muſt have many occaſions to travell for the putting forth of ſuch <hi>Bookes</hi> as he had in deſigne to write.

of thoſe that heard him perform his Acts and exerciſes, and great approbation of both the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> Dr. <hi>John Overall</hi> that profound Scholler, and Dr. <hi>Thomas Playfer</hi> that accute diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and accurate preacher, who were both of them very competent Judges of mens abilities.

In the year 1610. being the ſeaventh year of <hi>King James,</hi> was held a <hi>Parliament.</hi> And at the ſame time, (as the manner is,) a <hi>Convocation</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at St. <hi>Paules</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> where with generall applauſe he preached the Sermon <hi>ad clerum</hi> upon St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 13. <hi>Vos eſtis ſal terrae.</hi> And ſhould have been the <hi>prolocutour</hi> to the lower houſe of <hi>Convocation,</hi> but that in modeſty he declined it, and the rather to make way for a friend of his, whom he rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired might have that office.</p>

Upon the like occaſions and about the ſame time, he had the opportunity of entering into a very good acquaintance with ſeverall other eminent forraign Scholars and Divines; As namely <hi>Abraham Scultetus</hi> profeſſour of divinity in the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> of <hi>Heidlebergh</hi> and <hi>Aulicus Concionator</hi> to his Highneſs <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince <hi>Electour</hi> palatine, <hi>John Diodati</hi> profeſſour of divinity at <hi>Geneva</hi> a very learned and judicious Divine; <hi>Peter du Molin</hi> the famous preacher at <hi>Charington,</hi> and ſeverall others, whoſe worth is very well known by their learned works in Print.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. His continuance in the <hi>Deanary</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> was not ſo long as he deſired, and yet when he was to be removed from it, and to be conſecrated <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> there was a rub caſt in his way by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great perſon; Not out of any favour or reſpct to him, but the quite contrary.

When he was ſetled there, he found all the inconveniences which he foreſaw, and which made him at firſt ſo loath to undertake that weighty office, and ſome alſo which he could not foreſee at ſo great a diſtance. For beſide the great number of <hi>Romiſh Recuſants,</hi> which hath allwayes been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in this <hi>Dioceſs</hi>; he found another ſort of <hi>Recuſants,</hi> (better known by the name of <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi>) who though they were not as many in number as the other, yet had they ſo much <hi>perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>obſtinacy</hi> in them, as made them equall, or rather ſuperior, in relation to the trouble he had with them.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. And therefore his firſt care was to reduce them to their <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> wherein he uſed no leſs of <hi>fatherly</hi> mildneſs towards them, then

ſtrength of <hi>argument</hi> againſt them. For having cited before him ſuch of the <hi>Clergy</hi> as were the chief of that party, (whereof the principall ring-leader was one Mr. <hi>Hynd,)</hi> he firſt enquired of them the reaſon of their <hi>non-conformity</hi>; which when he underſtood to be, <hi>The uſe of the Surplice, the Croſs at Baptiſme,</hi> and <hi>the Ring in Marriage,</hi> he was content himſelf to endeavour their ſatisfaction in a <hi>publick and ſolemn conference</hi> with them upon all theſe three poynts. But their perverſneſs fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his expectation and deſires, in relation to their own good, his next care was to make his endeavours more publick, for the common good of the reſt of their partie. And therefore he Printed a <hi>relation</hi> of that <hi>conference</hi> with ſome enlargements; which he intituled: <hi>The defence of the three innocent cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>

Having thus fallen caſually upon this <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it will be requiſite to ſpeak more fully of it, ſeeing this <hi>reverend Biſhop</hi> was in a peculiar manner concerned in it. And the caſe was thus: It was no ſmall policie in the leaders of the Popiſh party to keep the <hi>people</hi> from <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>danceing</hi> and other <hi>recreations,</hi> even in the time of <hi>divine ſervice,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on <hi>holy dayes,</hi> and the <hi>Lords day</hi> in the after noon: By which meanes they kept the people in <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>luke warmneſſe,</hi> and ſo made them the more capable to be wrought upon by their emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Which groſs abuſe this <hi>Biſhop</hi> endeavered to redreſs in his <hi>primarie viſitation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="47">47. But it was repreſented to <hi>King James</hi> as a very great greivance, at his return out of <hi>Scotland</hi> through <hi>Lancaſhire, Anno.</hi> 1617. by ſome in <hi>Court</hi> who were too favourable to that partie. And his readineſs to hear any complaint againſt a thing that carried but the name of a <hi>publick greivance,</hi> incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged ſome to ſo much boldneſs the next <hi>Lords day</hi> after, as even to diſturb the publick worſhip and ſervice of God, by their piping and dancing within the hearing of all thoſe that were at Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>King</hi> being fully informed by this <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſavoued any thoughts or intention of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courraging ſuch prophaneneſs: and therefore left them that were guilty of it to the <hi>Biſhops cenſure</hi>; which he inflicted only upon one, that was the head and cauſer of it, by way of publick <hi>acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:54093:49"/>
of the fault, and <hi>penance</hi> for it; having formerly cauſed the Piper to be laid by the heeles.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. There wanted not ſome ſtill to complain to the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> proceedings herein as rigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and tyranicall; conſidering that the chief thing they deſired was only ſome <hi>Innocent Recreation</hi> for ſervants and other inferiour people on the <hi>Lords day</hi> and <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> whoſe laborious callings deprived them of it at all other times: and thereupon to ſollicit his <hi>Majeſty</hi> for ſome favour therein, and the rather becauſe it was the generall deſire of moſt of that <hi>Country.</hi> Which the <hi>King</hi> finding to be true upon enquirie, and willing to give them ſatisfaction therein, conſulted with this reverend perſon being the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of that <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> how he might ſatisfy their deſires without endangering this <hi>liberty</hi> to be turned into <hi>Licentiouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="49">49. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> hereupon retiring from the Court at <hi>Houghton Tower,</hi> to his own lodging at <hi>Preſton,</hi> conſidered of <hi>ſix Limitations</hi> or <hi>Reſtrictions,</hi> by way of <hi>Condition,</hi> to be impoſed upon every man that ſhould enjoy the benefit of that <hi>liberty</hi>; which he preſented to the <hi>King</hi> in writing the next day; and which the <hi>King</hi> did very well approve of, and added a <hi>ſeventh</hi>; ſaying only, he would <hi>alter them from the words of a Biſhop, to the words of a King.</hi> It is not to be omitted that Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> attended the <hi>King</hi> at the ſame time, and therefore in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability was conſulted in the ſame buſineſs; but all I can poſitively ſay in it, is what I have here ſaid, and this I can poſitively ſay becauſe I have often heard it from this reverend <hi>Biſhops</hi> own mouth.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54093:50"/>
And upon this it was that <hi>King James</hi> publiſhed his <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>May the</hi> twenty-fourth in the 16. and 51. year of his <hi>Reigne,</hi> intituled [<hi>concerning law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſports to be uſed,</hi>] under theſe following <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Limitations,</hi> which I think not amiſſe to inſert, ſeeing all of them but one, (which I think is the firſt,) had their originall and firſt being from this <hi>reverend Biſhop,</hi> viz.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. 1. That all <hi>unlawfull games</hi> ſhould be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited on Sundayes,</hi> as <hi>Beare &amp; Bull-bayting, interludes, and bowling at all times by law prohibited to the meaner ſort of people.</hi> 2. <hi>That all ſuch known Recuſants, either men or women, as abſtained from coming to Church, or divine ſervice,</hi> ſhall be <hi>barred from this benefit and liberty; they being therefore unworthy of any lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation after the ſaid ſervice, that will not firſt come to Church and ſerve God.</hi> 3. <hi>All that, though conforme in religion, are not preſent at Church at the ſervice of God before their going to the ſaid recreations,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo debarred this liberty. 4. <hi>All ſuch as, in abuſe of this liberty,</hi> ſhould <hi>uſe theſe exerciſes before the end of all divine ſervices for that day,</hi> were to be <hi>Preſented and ſharply puniſhed.</hi> 5. That <hi>every perſon ſhould reſort to his own pariſh Church, to heare divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> And 6. <hi>that each pariſh by it ſelf ſhould uſe the ſaid recreation after divine ſervice.</hi> 7. And laſt of all. That <hi>no offenſive weapons ſhould be carried, or uſed, in the ſaid times of recreation.</hi> I have kept my ſelf to the very words of the <hi>Declaration</hi> as much as I could.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. And he that ſhall duely conſider theſe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions,</hi> and compare them with the temper of the people in thoſe parts at that time as they were then
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54093:50"/>
wrought upon by ſome emiſſaries of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> partie; will eaſily ſee and grant that this was in all probability the likeſt courſe to bring them to <hi>Church</hi> to ſerve God, and to be inſtructed out of his word; and conſequently to ſtop the current both of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Profaneſs,</hi> by allowing them a ſmall latitude for <hi>innocent-recreations</hi> thus limitted and bounded.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. I am not ignorant what tragicall exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome have raiſed againſt the ſame <hi>Declaration,</hi> when it was reprinted and publiſhed a new by our late <hi>Gracious Soveraigne</hi>; whether out of faction and malice to traduce him and the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and inadvertencie in not ſearching into the true ſtate of the queſtion, muſt be left to the <hi>ſearcher of hearts</hi> to judge. Only this I ſhall add for the betrer information of the miſguided people, that, (ſetting aſide the <hi>convenience</hi> of republiſhing this <hi>declaration</hi> at that time, whereof I am no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge, and which ought not to be meaſured by the event,) all the arguments I could ever yet ſee urged againſt the <hi>Lawfullneſs</hi> of what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by it, (taking it as it is ſtill, and ever was reſtrained by theſe <hi>limitations</hi> and <hi>conditions,)</hi> are grounded upon no other bottom, for the moſt part, then the bare name of <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as it is applied, or miſapplyed to the <hi>Lords day.</hi> Which being a queſtion ſtill under diſpute among learned men on both ſides, I ſhall trouble my Reader no further about it: and had not thus far, but only to defend this learned <hi>Biſhop</hi> from the calumnies which ſome may ſtill caſt upon him in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                     <p n="53">
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54093:51"/>53. I ſhall ſay no more of him while he was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but only, that the great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied paines he took in this <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> and the ſmall revenue of the <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> and the great neceſſity there was of advancing <hi>Charity,</hi> and maintaining <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> (eſpecially in that place where <hi>good Houſe-keeping</hi> is ſo much valued and practiſed,) moved <hi>King James</hi> to beſtow upon him the <hi>Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Stopford</hi> by way of <hi>Commendam,</hi> for the better ſupport of his charge and dignity, which he held during the time he was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of this See; and where his name and memory is ſtill precious among ſuch of the pariſhoners as are of years ſufficient to remember his being among them.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. In the year 1617. the See of <hi>Leichfield and Coventry</hi> became void by the <hi>tranſlation</hi> of his old friend that learned prelate Dr. <hi>Overall,</hi> (above mentioned,) to the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Norwich.</hi> To ſupply which vacancy the <hi>King</hi> was pleaſed to have this reverend <hi>Biſhop</hi> tranſlated thither the year after, at the motion of that great pattern of <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> perfection, Dr. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> (above mentioned,) then <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Elie,</hi> who was never known to do the like for any other, and yet did this without his ſeeking or knowledge, that he might have him his nearer Neighbour, (as he ſaid,) and of the ſame <hi>province</hi> with himſelf. His <hi>Tarnſlation</hi> beareth date, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6, 1618.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. And here his trouble was not ſo great as at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> though his <hi>Dioceſs</hi> was larger, becauſe the common ſort of people for the moſt part were better principled by the care and vigilancy of his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54093:51"/>
predeceſſour. But yet he abated nothing of his former paines and induſtry, both in <hi>Writing, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Conferring</hi> with thoſe that were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſtinat; beſide his <hi>ordinary vigilancie</hi> in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting</hi> his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> and care in <hi>Confirming</hi> ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as could give an account of their <hi>Faith.</hi> It would be too large a task for me to relate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. About the time he was tranſlated to this See, there came over into <hi>England</hi> that very learned, though unfortunate man, <hi>Marcus Antonius de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> primat of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> &amp;c.

This great Scholar, (after he had ſo profoundly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth of <hi>Chriſtian religion,</hi> as it is profeſſed and practiſed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in ſo many particulars againſt the errours and corruptions of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his learned and laborious Books, <hi>De Republica Eccleſiaſtica</hi>; and had alſo from the <hi>Kings</hi> bounty received ſo great incouragements for his honourable ſupport, as the <hi>Deanary</hi> of <hi>Windſour</hi> and <hi>Maſterſhip</hi> of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> beſides many rich and yearly preſents, not only from the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentery,)</hi> was ſo far wrought upon by that great Politition count <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damar,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Embaſſador</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> and other inſtruments of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (that ſought his ruin under ſome ſpecious pretences,) as to take up a reſolution of returning to <hi>Rome</hi>; and could not be diſſwaded from it by his true friends that really endeavoured his ſecurity: Among whom this <hi>Reverend Biſhop</hi> was neither the leaſt nor laſt,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54093:52"/>
who very earneſtly adviſed him, both by word and writing, not to venture himſelf upon ſuch a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and haſſardous journey.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. The <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> pretence was very plauſible and commendable, (and how reall he was in it, muſt be left to God,) namely, to <hi>Negotiat</hi> an <hi>unity in Religion</hi> between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> upon thoſe moderate grounds which he had laid down, and ſo well defended in his learned and laborious works printed here at <hi>London.</hi> He applauded himſelf in the excellency of the work, in removing the <hi>Schiſme</hi>; and of the honour in becoming <hi>a Repairer of the breach,</hi> and of the reward which is promiſed to the <hi>Peacemakers.</hi> And he thought himſelf the more likely to go through with his work by reaſon of the ſeaſonable opportunity he had at that time when <hi>Gregory</hi> the fiftenth, was newly choſen <hi>Pope</hi> who had been of his old and intimate acquaintance, brought up in the ſame Schole and College with him. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he was reſolved to make an attempt; becauſe if he failled in it, he hoped he ſhould loſe nothing but his labour. For as for his <hi>Indemnity,</hi> count <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damar</hi> had promiſed him the ſecurity of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> his Maſter. But how well that promiſe was performed will appear by the ſequel.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. While he was ſwelled up full with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and theſe hopes, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Leichfeild</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> coming to viſit him, had this inſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, (among many others,) which I have often heard him repeat with pleaſure, and ſhall therefore inſert it: and the rather becauſe it ſhewes us of how little authority the <hi>Councell of

                     <p n="59">59. This diſcourſe, (and many other too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall here to mention,) having paſſed between them, they parted friendly. And not long after did this <hi>Biſhop</hi> reinforce his arguments, with an addition of many more, in a long and learned Epiſtle to him. Wherein, (among other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to diſſvade him from his journey,) he uſed one, wherein he ſhewed himſelf a true prophet, concerning the entertainment he was like to find at <hi>Rome.</hi> Which proved to be that before he got to <hi>Rome</hi>; Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fiftenth, his old friend was dead, and a ſucceſſour choſen in his place; by whom this <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was impriſoned <hi>in Caſtro</hi> St. <hi>Angelo.</hi> Where he died, not without ſtrong ſuſpicion of <hi>Murder</hi> or <hi>Poyſon</hi>: And his <hi>body</hi> was afterward burnt, (as of an <hi>Heretick,</hi>) <hi>in Campo Flori.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="60">60. I could here ſtart a problematicall queſtion concerning this learned <hi>Arch-Biſhop. Whether or no did he ever retract his works, which he publiſhed in Print</hi>? If he did, why did they at <hi>Rome</hi> burn his <hi>body</hi> for <hi>Hereſie</hi>? If not, then they abuſed him in his life time, as well as after his death, in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54093:53"/>
                        <hi>Manifeſto</hi> which they put forth in his name, which was ſo learnedly anſwered by Dr. <hi>Crakanthorp.</hi> There is but one way of avoiding this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> (and that will bring them into a greater ſtrait then either of the other,) namely that they <hi>burnt</hi> him <hi>after his death for</hi> what he <hi>retracted in his life time</hi>; and if they own this, they muſt withall proclaime their <hi>injuſtice</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> to the world. Let them take it in which ſence they will, his <hi>reaſons</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> laid down and urged in his learned works will more condemne their cauſe, then the <hi>altering of his opinion,</hi> (ſuppoſing but not granting that he ever altered it,) can tend to their advantage. His many clear and convincing <hi>Authorityes,</hi> from the <hi>Holy Scriptures, Councells, Fathers, Hiſtorians,</hi> and their <hi>own Authours</hi> will be far more argumentative to any indifferent perſon that is not wilfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed; then his own dubious, (perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,) authority can countervaile. His <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> (if it was <hi>his,</hi>) conſiſteth only in <hi>affirming</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> in <hi>bare words</hi>: In his <hi>works,</hi> whatſoever is <hi>affirmed</hi> or <hi>denied,</hi> is backt with ſuch <hi>convincing</hi> and <hi>irrefragable arguments,</hi> as no man hath taken the boldneſs in all theſe forty years ſince they were written, to undertake the anſwering of them.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. I muſt acknowledge this to be a Digreſſion, and therefore muſt haſten the faſter from it. And ſo I ſhall alſo from the reſt of the occurrences which, concerned this <hi>Biſhop</hi> while he governed the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Leichfeild and Coventry</hi>: Which were not many of any memorable note, (for as much as I could learn,) though the time he ſate there
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54093:53"/>
was above fourteen years. I ſhall only inſtance in two, whereof the one concerned a perſon that ſeemed to be <hi>more then a man,</hi> the other a <hi>Boy</hi> that ſeemed to be <hi>little leſs then a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="62">62. The former was one <hi>George Canner,</hi> who like another <hi>Didimus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Fiſher</hi> of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> was <hi>born blind</hi>; and yet was not inferiour to either of them, (the proportion of his age being conſidered,) either in <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>parts,</hi> or <hi>induſtry</hi> in getting of learning, or <hi>memory</hi> in retaining what he had once heard. Among the reſt of the works of <hi>Charity</hi> performed by this <hi>Biſhop</hi> while he was of that <hi>See,</hi> one was to bring up this youth in good learning, (his parents being poor and not well able to do it themſelves,) which he did firſt at <hi>Schole,</hi> and afterward when he was fitted to receive <hi>Univerſity</hi> learning he ſent him to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he maintained him at his own charge in St. <hi>Johns College,</hi> and his <hi>

And after he was well grounded in all manner of ſecular learning, and had taken the Degree of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellour of Arts,</hi> he ſent for him into his own family, and there inſtructed him in the whole <hi>Body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>; And afterward admitted him into <hi>ſacred Orders,</hi> and placed him in the pariſh Church of <hi>Clifton Canvile</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> where he undertook the cure of their ſoules, and diligently and laudably diſcharged the duty of his place; being a very good preacher, and (which is more) able alſo to perform the <hi>whole office of the Church,</hi> as it is preſcribed by the <hi>Book of Common Prayer,</hi> only by the ſtrength of his admirable <hi>memory.</hi>

This <hi>Boy</hi> being by nature very dull and uncapable of learning, and thereupon very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go to Schole, was wrought upon by ſome <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> in thoſe parts to free himſelf from that troubleſome task of going to Schole, by counterfeiting himſelf to be <hi>poſſeſſed with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>; and he had the promiſe of a very good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the bargain, if he would ſuffer himſelf to be <hi>diſpoſſeſſed</hi> by their <hi>Exorciſmes.</hi> But the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi> having <hi>ſteeled his heart,</hi> (as his own phraſe was afterward in his confeſſion,) he continued to act the <hi>Demoniack</hi> both longer and otherwiſe then they deſired who firſt inſtructed him in the art.

The particulars whereof both there in <hi>publick,</hi> and elſewhere more <hi>privatly,</hi> as alſo of his exceeding great <hi>art</hi> in <hi>Counterfeiting,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in <hi>enduring</hi> any thing to keep himſelf from being diſcovered, would be too large a task, and too impertinent here to relate; and hath been by <note place="margin">In a book writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by Mr. <hi>Rich.

of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> which for many hundreds of years had been anexed to his <hi>Epiſcopall See.</hi> In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he had the power of placing and diſplace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the <hi>Judges, Regiſters, Clerks,</hi> and other officers belonging to the <hi>Courts of Juſtice</hi>; of conſtituting the <hi>Sheriffe</hi> and <hi>under Sheriffe, Eſcheters, Feudaries, Coroners,</hi> &amp;c.

I do hereby in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Almighty God, ſolemnly <hi>proteſt</hi> and <hi>Declare</hi> to all the world, that what this <hi>Author</hi> there affirms concerning me is a moſt notorious untruth and a groſs ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For to the beſt of my knowledge and remembrance no ſuch <hi>Book</hi> as he there mentions, was ever <hi>preſented to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Houſe,</hi> in that or any other <hi>Parliament</hi> that I ever ſate in: and if there had, I could never have made ſuch a <hi>ſpeech</hi> as is there pretended, ſeeing I have ever ſpoken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my thoughts, and alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that <hi>Fable of the Nags-head Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to have proceeded from <hi>the Father of Lyes,</hi> as the <hi>Authentick Records of the Church</hi> ſtill extant, which were ſo faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſcribed and publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> do evidently teſtifie. And whereas the ſame impudent <hi>Libeller</hi> doth moreover ſay, that what he there affirms <hi>was told to many by one of the Ancienteſt Peers of England pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Parliament when I made this</hi> [preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded] <hi>ſpeech,</hi> and that <hi>he is ready to depoſe the ſame upon his oath,</hi> and that <hi>he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any will be ſo impudent as to deny a thing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54093:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo notorious, whereof there are as many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes living as there are Lords and Biſhops that were that day in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, that I am very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to believe any <hi>Peer of England</hi> ſhould have ſo little ſenſe of his Conſcience and Honour, as either to ſwear, or ſo much as affirm ſo notorious an untruth. And therefore, for the juſtification of my ſelf, and manifeſtation of the <hi>truth</hi> in this particular, I do freely and willingly <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> (as he directs me) to thoſe many <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> perſons the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal</hi> yet alive, who ſate in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Peers</hi> in that <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to as many of them as this my <hi>Proteſtation</hi> can come to, for a true <hi>Certificate</hi> of what they know or believe concerning this matter: humbly deſiring them, and charging upon their <hi>Souls,</hi> as they will anſwer it to <hi>God</hi> at the <hi>Day of Judgement,</hi> that they will be pleaſed to teſtifie the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>nothing but the truth</hi> herein, to the beſt of their <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>remembrance,</hi> without any favour or affection to me at all. I cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be ſuſpected by any indifferent man
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54093:66"/>
of denying any thing that, I know or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be true, ſeeing I am ſo ſhortly in all probability to render an account to the <hi>Searcher of hearts</hi> of all my words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being now (at the leaſt) upon the <hi>Ninty fifth year of my Age</hi>: and I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it a great mercy and favour of God, that he hath reſerved me thus long to clear the <hi>Church of England</hi> and my ſelf of this moſt notorious ſlander, before he takes me to himſelf: for I cannot imagine any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why this ſhameleſs <hi>writer</hi> might not have caſt the ſame upon any of my <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren</hi> as well as me, but only that I being the <hi>Eldeſt,</hi> it was probable I might be in my grave before this untruth could be taken notice of in the world.

                     <p n="1">1. I Am not ignorant how hard a task this third and laſt part of my undertaking would be, if I ſhould be operoſe in it, for the ſame reaſon, that none was thought ſo fit to write <hi>Caeſars Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf. But this is a thing may the more lightly be paſſed over, both becauſe he hath been a <hi>burning and ſhining Light</hi> upon ſo eminent a <hi>Candleſtick</hi> for ſo many years, as renders him very well known to moſt men; and becauſe I had not only his permiſſion, but <hi>Command</hi> to write what now I do, on purpoſe to prevent the over la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh expreſſions, by way of <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> which he feared, and forbad from another hand, which will obliged me both to moderation and brevity in what I ſhall ſpeak of him; and laſt of all becauſe I have upon another occaſion made ſome <hi>Eſſay</hi> towards this work already,<note place="margin">Sermon at his Funeral.</note> which the reader will find here prefixed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. At that time the <hi>Text</hi> which confined my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, led me wholly to make it appear how well he had ſtudied, and how diligently he had practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the example of S. <hi>Paul</hi>: and therefore it would be ſuperfluous in me now to enter upon any large diſcourſe, to ſhew what a <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> his life was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. verſ. 6, &amp;c. and how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly his <hi>Epiſcopal Qualifications</hi> anſwered thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> which that great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there preſcribeth as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54093:81"/>
the <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Touch-ſtone</hi> whereby <hi>every Biſhop</hi> ought to be tryed and examined. For the greater will preſuppoſe the leſſer <hi>a fortiore</hi>; and therefore he that had made the <hi>Apoſtles Life</hi> the rule of his own, may well be preſumed to have taken out thoſe inferiour leſſons which are indiſpenſably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in every <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
