            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ACTS VII. VER. 26.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Sirs, ye are Brethren, Why do you wrong one to another?</p>
               </q>

            <p>THE open Assaults and the secret Practices of our Enemies are things that we are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, we look for them, and guard against them; so that we are not surprised with them, nor unprovided when they appear. But the mutual Animosities of those who are all united
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64579:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the same Common Interests, and that ought to be animated with the same Spirit, have somewhat in them that is more terrible, that carries the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of a Nation not capable of a Deliverance, but fitted for destruction. This is at all times deplorable, but sometimes it is so dismal, that it is not easie to see a People in such a State, when their Dangers are extreme; without concluding that so fatall a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness must be the Mark as well as the effect of some Stroak from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Who could have seen <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the State in which <hi>Iosephus</hi> describes it, without concluding them Cursed of God? Besieged by the greatest Power that was then in the World, &amp; languishing in Famine; yet in the Intervals of the Attacks of their Enemies, giving one another no rest, but divided into three great Parties, who were Butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, as oft as their Enemies gave them leisure for it.</p>
            <p>Somewhat not unlike this, though in a lower form, is set forth in the words of my Text: The Posterity of <hi>Iacob</hi> had endured a terrible Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and it was no wonder if while they groaned under such an oppression, an Israelite and an Egyptian were engaged in a Quarrel, in which <hi>Moses</hi> it seems took it for granted, that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian was in the Wrong, and so he killed him in the assistance of an injured Israelite. But it was an astonishing thing to him to see two Israelites fighting; therefore he who was the meekest Man in the Earth, studied to soften both their minds, with a reproof that in very gentle words, set forth the madness of their quarrel with great Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64579:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They were Brethren either as they were one people ingaged all in the same Interests, groaning under the same miseries, and wishing for the same common Deliverance; or as they were all initiated into the same Covenant with God, as being the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the promise made to him. But besides this general consideration of their being <hi>Brethren,</hi> there <hi>were</hi> two special ones that enforced it in their present Circumstances.</p>
            <p>They were in Bondage to a strong, an ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a perfidious, and a cruel Enemy; that forgetful of all the Services <hi>Ioseph</hi> had rendred the Crown, was not satisfied with condemning them to an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Slavery: but carried this to so Brutal a degree of Cruelty, as to design the Murder of all their Male Issue, and even to oblige Parents to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the fruit of their own Body. Now while they were under so terrible a Bondage, it seemed a very unnatural piece of madness for them to have any Quarrels among themselves. But besides this they had reason to believe that a deliverance was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching: the time that was marked by Prophecy, for the continuance of their Captivity was now <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 13.</note> almost expired; so they had reason to believe that God was to appear very speedily, and to set them at liberty: and therefore nothing was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that prospect, than for them in such a state of things to engage into Quarrels and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities, which might naturally have produced such Consequences, that they must have been very much disabled from being the Instruments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in such a glorious Work, as that which they had reason to conclude was now near at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64579:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hand, since the Period of 430 Years was now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring.</p>
            <p>From the Consideration of the mutual tie of their being Brethren, it was reasonable to expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>Why do you wrong one to another?</hi> Insinuating that in such quarrellings the wrong lay not only on the one side, but was mutual. Both were to blame, they wronged one another, and wronged the Publick besides. But though both were in the wrong, we see who was most so, even he that would not hear of a reconciliation, or of the putting a stop to the Quarrel; he reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Moses</hi> with the assistance that he had given the day before to an Israelite against an Egyptian: so enraged he was at the friendly interposition of <hi>Moses</hi> in the matter, that he seems concerned for the Egyptian that was killed; a Publick Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing less hated than a Brother, when those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Feuds are once raised to any height; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Reconciler becomes then more odious than an Alien.</p>
            <p>This is the account of the occasion on which these words were spoken, and of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and of the effect they had. In the next place, let us consider how far we may be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them.</p>
            <p>We have been engaged in a great and hard struggle with open Enemies as cruel and as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or the Egyptians ever were: We have overcome them, but now we are falling into mutual quarrellings; some are whetting on their spirits to Revenge, by the remembrance of past Errors, with relation to Civil Matters: others are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64579:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
raising up those Disputes which have been already once and again so fatal to us, that they have given us often cause to wish that they had never been once named amongst us; and after all these unhappy Consequences that such things have hitherto had, we are now again trying our Strength, mustring our Forces, and raising within our own Minds, and in the Minds of all, over whom we have any Influence, all the sowrness and peevishness that is possible, which at any other time were an inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable piece of Folly; but now it is a Madness that wants a Name. Let us then so far at least take breath in our Quarrel as to hearken to these words, and to examine what is imported by them. <hi>Ye are Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This belongs to us, first, as we are <hi>Englishmen,</hi> all of the same Nation under the same Laws, and the same Protection, shut up indeed in an Island, which as it separates us from all the World, so it secures us against all the World. We were anciently a broken People divided into many Kingdoms, and tho' most of these were swallowed up many Ages ago, yet we were never brought all under one Head before the beginning of this Century: Our Climate, it is true, is none of the best; we have but a faint Sun, and the Product of our Soil cannot be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that of more Southern Regions; but our Ports and Rivers give us such Advantages, that we send out both Colonies and Manufactures all the World over, and fetch home rich Returns; so that we have both Security and Wealth beyond any of our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64579:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It is a melancholy thing to live upon a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and to be subject to the Chances of War, and to all the Depredations, and Miseries which follow all Wars; but it is yet much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to be in the Neighbourhood of that cruel and barbarous Enemy of Mankind, who having laid off all the tenderness of humane Nature, and the regards that have been by a common consent held sacred in the most destructive Wars, executes whole Countries all at once: who after all the Wealth that can possibly be squeezed out of them, is drawn from them to the last Farthing for purchasing a Security for their Houses, Persons, and Cattel: Who I say, after these Securities are so dearly paid for, sends the final Order of destroying all, and burning, and wasting every thing without exception. I speak not this to aggravate matters with words of Pomp; I say nothing but what they do daily practise, and of which I have seen many fatal Proofs in the Ruins of many great Towns, and large Countries, where the Words of <hi>Ioel</hi> were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally accomplished by that devouring Army; the Country before them being like the <hi>Garden of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> but behind them like a <hi>desolate Wilderness.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joel 2. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But our Security from Enemies without us, is but half our Happiness: We are safe at home like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, having the blessing of a Government so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that as we are not exposed to the Fury of a levelling Multitude, nor the Confusions of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality among Men, but have a Government that is strong and firm enough to keep us in Order and Obedience; so we have the greatest Blessing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64579:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that can be found in Government in as high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as wise men can desire. Oh! the difference between us and some happier Climates, where mens Estates and Liberties, and often their Lives are at the mercy of mere Humour and Passion: where the Frowns of a Court can throw a man in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the most plentiful to the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition imaginable: where one rash word is thought Crime enough for a perpetual Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment joyned with all the Circumstances of Rigour that can render it much more terrible than Death it self; so that if such Tyrants do not make many publick Examples of their Severity, their design in so doing seems only to be to lengthen out the Miseries of such as suffer at their hands, that so they may glut themselves with a more lasting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. I say, nothing of those terrible Impositions by which they eat out the Fortunes, and the very Strength of their Subjects, all mens Estates by a quick Circulation, are melted into the support of their Unjust Wars, or Extravagant Expences; and the poorer sort must give at least the half of their time to work, in order to the paying those cruel Taxes, by which they grind their People. Their ruined Houses, their ragged Cloaths, their hungry Looks, and their half-naked Children, give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proofs of the Tyranny of those Governments that can render their People extreamly miserable, in spite of all that abundance which Nature has set before them, while Millions of People are pining away in Want and Beggary, that so a few may sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit themselves with all the Excesses of Fulness and Vice. This is a short hint of that which every one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64579:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that has travelled abroad has seen in the richest Countries beyond Sea, God grant we may never see it nearer. But we know it has been the Language of all the Flatterers of lawless Power, that nothing can tame People, and make them quiet and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent but Poverty; whereas Plenty makes them haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mutinous, as if <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Maxims had been to be derived to all his Successors in Tyranny: <hi>Ye are idle, ye are idle, therefore ye say, let me go.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We are all then Brethren, as we are <hi>Englishmen</hi> and <hi>Freemen,</hi> born under a Government that gives us all possible Securities for both Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the two chief earthly Blessings of humane Nature, whose Persons can neither be restrained, nor punished beyond the bounds of Law; who can be charged with no Taxes but by their own Consent; and who can be subject to no Laws but what were prayed by themselves.</p>
            <p>Happy Liberty! and happy Subjects! if they but knew their own Happiness; but as good Men love Liberty, so it is only wise Men that can value it and secure it; Fools part with it easily, and if they pay but a little for the Purchase of it, are apt to think it is dear bought. The <hi>Israelites</hi> in their March when they saw not the abundance to which they had been accustomed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> wish'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there again; so a voluptuous Nation that was <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 3.</note> over-set with abundance, and corrupted with Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may think it was better with them when they were languishing away under that false appearance of Plenty, into a certain Ruine; then now, if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64579:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Prospect of Liberty is like for a year or two to force them to be a little more frugal and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, less vain, and less prodigal: such a lessening of Expence to secure Liberty, will appear intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to those that have not sense enough to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it, nor Vertue enough to starve their Vices; that they may settle it upon themselves and their Posterities.</p>
            <p>Our Neighbours in the Low Countries after they had felt the smart of Tyranny, resolved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to recover their Liberty, or to perish in the Attempt, and by a War of Forty Years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance a small Corner of the World maintained it self against the greatest Power then in <hi>Europe,</hi> and was reduced to a Misery and Poverty; that nothing but an obstinate Resolution of being Freemen, or of perishing, could have supported. In Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Noble Designs were bless'd with Success, they became the Wonder, and the Envy of the World, the Arbiters of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Supports of that very Power which then studied to crush them, and to crown their Glory, the Instruments of giving us Liberty, as well as of securing their own. And yet after all this, tho' the Name of their Government has a greater sound towards Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty than our own, we are really the much freer People of the two, where every man has a more open access to a proportioned share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than among them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64579:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That small Expence which we may borrow from our Pleasures to secure our Liberty will be soon repaied to us in that firm and settled Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which is in our view. We run indeed the hazard of losing it, and we deserve that it should be so, if we either throw it up, as not worth the holding, or let it be snatched from us by the great Ravisher of Liberty, and common Enemy to Mankind: the truth is that Corruption of our Morals which is spread so universally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nation, gives us just Cause of apprehending that we have not Vertue enough left to maintain Liberty. But that as the voluptuous and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>Romans,</hi> after they had shaken off <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, were too much vitiated to return to their Ancient Government, and so they quickly fell under a new, a worse, and more lasting Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Thus we who have fallen so far from the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of our Ancestors, can never be able to maintain those Rights which they derived to us, if we do not resolve to return to their Vertues, and to cleanse our selves of those Vices which do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave us. If we will unite in maintaining this common Cause, and concur with every man who on this occasion is willing to shew himself an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman,</hi> if we will forget all our little Interests to mind this great One, and sacrifice small matters for the saving our All, then we will shew that we are Brethren, all born of one common Mother, and all equally concerned in her Preservation.</p>
            <p>But in this <hi>ye are Brethren,</hi> there is a closer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation implied; That as the <hi>Iews</hi> were all <hi>Brethren</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64579:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with regard to that Covenant to which they had a Right, as they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; so we Christians are <hi>Brethren,</hi> as we profess the same common Christianity, and look for the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation. As we are <hi>Christians,</hi> or as we are <hi>Protestants</hi> we are <hi>Brethren,</hi> believing the same Gospel, owning the same God, and the same Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, animated by the same Spirit, and hoping to live together in the same state of Happiness for ever. In all these respects we are <hi>Brethren;</hi> for that we are <hi>Protestants,</hi> imports no more but that we are <hi>Christians</hi> who believe that holy Religion in the same Purity and Simplicity in which it was at first delivered to the World. If there happen to be any Diversities among us about some lesser things, we ought first to compare the Importance of that in which we agree, with that in which we differ; and if we find the one is vastly great, and the other is nothing in comparison to it, then it is plain, that small Differences must give place to the greater Points, in which we are at one; for all that act otherwise, shew clearly, that tho' they do not think it decent to speak out what they think, yet in their Hearts they undervalue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest of the Protestant Religion in which we agree, but set a real Value upon indifferent matters, and are acted by the Heats and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of a Party, to which all other things give place. It was not only a certain sign of Ruine to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but an infallible Cause of it, that while they were besieged by the <hi>Romans,</hi> instead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting together the Methods of their common Defence, they were broke into such irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable

Feuds, that they no sooner had a time of breathing given them by their Besiegers, than they fell upon one another, so that they became their own most implacable Enemies. When the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> were too hard for the whole State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, the Eastern and Western Churches fell out about so trifling a matter, as whether the Bread in the Sacrament ought to be leavened, or not: This first broke them, then some other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much more important, were found out to widen the breach, which had such Effects, that the Western Nations that ought to have support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Greek</hi> Church and Empire, if not out of Charity to them, yet out of a due care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they might be covered by such a <hi>Barrier</hi> from the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, lookt on, and saw them destroyed, and found themselves by that means exposed to a Power that has been so often formidable to <hi>Europe.</hi> Shall not the Madness and Miseries of others make us so wise as to fortifie our selves all we can, and to forget, if we cannot quite remove the Occasions of our Differences: Shall an evil Spirit still prevail among us to the defeating all the Designs of Providence, and the crossing of all Attempts for Peace and Union? so that neither the Errors that all men seemed lately to confess, nor the Promises which were then generally made, neither our late Distress, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>When the Reformation appeared first in the World, it made a mighty progress; whole States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms embraced it so fast, that the Advances it made in the hands of a few Instruments, seemed to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of Miracles, and look't like a great one it self: but all on a sudden it came to a full stop, and now for above an hundred years it has gained little ground, but lost much. The chief reason that can be assigned for this, is, That those who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, instead of carrying on their common Cause with an united Strength, have fallen a quarrelling among themselves about some Uncertain and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable things. Those in <hi>Germany</hi> being broken about the manner of the Presence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though all agree, that neither the one, nor the other Opinion has any relation, either to the Worship of God, or to any Practical Duty: Those

in <hi>Holland</hi> have quarrell'd about the Decrees and Councils of God, though both sides acknowledge that it is a Mystery past finding out: And we here in <hi>England</hi> have had a long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> and fierce Contest about things, which we all confess are indifferent in their own nature.</p>
            <p>This Animosity works still so high among us, that many take fire upon the smallest steps that can be made towards the healing so great a Breach; and fill all places with Tragical Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, as if the Church of <hi>England</hi> were to be pulled down: while the chief Promoters of these Reports know well how false they are; and that instead of offering at any thing that can in any sort weaken our Church, every thing which has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, must prove its Strength, as well as its Glory; if we are so happy as to weigh all in even Ballances. The things that are proposed are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves desirable, though there should not be one Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter gained by them; and are such as will tend to the making all the parts of our Offices both more Unexceptionable, and more Edifying. But Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are far gone, when the Patient rages at the first mention of a Medicine. We have lost many happy Opportunities since the first beginnings of the Reformation among us, for the healing our Breaches: One is sorry to remember them, and wishes that such fatal Errors could be covered from the knowledge of all succeeding Ages for the sake of the Church, and of those who have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned it. But if we do again repeat former Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and let the present Advantages that we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64579:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have now in our hands slip from us, what is to be said upon it, but that this is of the Lord, who by it is punishing us for our other sins, for our Remissness in our Duties; for our neglect of the Pastoral Care; for our slackning that strictness of Life which becomes our Profession; for our Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our selves too much in Sensuality and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness; and for all those other sins, by which we have <hi>departed from his Law, and have corrupted</hi>

               <hi>base and contemptible before the People;</hi> and that all <hi>our Flocks shall be scattered.</hi> But we might hope for better things, if every one would put away all Prejudices, all Wrath, Anger, and Revenge; and would put on Bowels of Mercies and Kindness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that we are Brethren. So that having puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our selves from Humour, Passion, Interest, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing else that may corrupt our minds, <hi>unto the</hi>

            <p>It is not the Differences themselves that keep us asunder, they are too Inconsiderable for that. It is a secret dislike that we bear to one another: For as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> could never have fallen out about so inconsiderable a matter as the Leavening the Bread in the Sacrament, if the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64579:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dispute about the Authority of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> had not embittered their minds: So our Subjects of Dispute are only the Occasions by which our Uncharitableness works; and if by bringing our selves to a more Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Temper, that hidden Disease were once cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all the Symptoms of it would fall off of themselves, and men would grow ashamed that they had ever spent so much Time and so much Zeal about things which deserve them so little. The Apostles who were full of this Divine Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, after they themselves had judged in a Dispute of much more Consequence than any is among us, yet were not only willing to let the <hi>Iews</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to do as they had wont to do, but even <hi>to the Iews they became Iews,</hi> that so they might <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 20.</note> gain them, not by a Spirit of servile Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but by the enlarged Spirit of true Charity, which is of too great a compass, to be limited within any narrow sub-division. By this Spirit it was, that
while St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Prisoner for the Gospel, some thinking to <hi>add affliction to his bonds, preached Christ not sincerely, but out of malice and envy;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 15, 18.</note> yet so Triumphant was the Spirit of Universal Love, and of Zeal for the Honour of his Blessed Master, in him, that he rejoiced in this, That Christ was Preached: And then do we become his Followers, when by a degree of the same Spirit, we can so far raise our minds above all the narrownesses of a Party, that tho we were assured that those men who differ from us, were in the wrong, and had ill designs against us, yet w<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Gospel, and so overcome their evil with our good.</p>
            <p>Upon all such occasions we ought not so much to consider what we owe to these with whom we have to do, as what we owe to our selves, to the Church, and to the succeeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So that if we can see how we may do that which may produce good effects at any distance of time from us, we ought to do it; though it should not, like a Charm, have a present sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble operation; nor ought things that are offered at for Peace, be rejected, if they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reasonable, because we cannot be assured before hand, that those in whose favour they are proposed, will be gained by them. The Church will always gain both with God and Man, by offering at Peace as much as is possible, and as much as in her lies; nor are we to stop in a good thing, because the effect is not certain; in such cases we may well trust the Providence of God; and things that will be their own Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, are never the worse, if they are defeated by the sowrness of unreasonable men; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as the one side will have the more Glory, so the other will be the more inexcusable, when great Concessions are frankly made, but unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely rejected.</p>
            <p>To crown all; We have still one reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade us to reflect a little more frequently on our being Brethren, since we know our Enemies do it to purpose; their Bottom is on Absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Infallibility, that are maintained by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit

Our Adversaries have indeed among them, many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, both in Doctrine and Practice, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a vast variety in their Rituals, that are much more important than any of those are, about which we are divided; and yet as soon as they see the common Cause concerned, they can lay all these to sleep, in order to their running down their Common Enemies; but we by a fatal obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy continue our Disputes, and heighten our Animosities, when our Enemies are in our Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, ready not only to take advantage of our Passions, but to devour us; while we, instead of securing our selves from them, seem only to be set on devouring one another. This is from God, and gives us a melancholly Prospect of it self; but a much more melancholly one, when we have reason to look upon it as a Judgment of God on us for our sins, and as a forerunner of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. We seem now to be in the like State with that in which <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was, when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our said of her, <hi>How often would I have gathered thee under my wings, as a hen gathereth her brood,</hi>

This leads me to consider the first Circumstance in which the <hi>Israelites</hi> were, that made it more necessary for them to remember that they were <hi>Brethren,</hi> since they were then in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to a Cruel, Treacherous, and Ingrateful Tyrant, who had both Strength enough to master them, and Rage enough to destroy them. It is true, such has the goodness of God been to us, that we are not now in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but we were lately very near the being brought under that Yoke: and if we do not manage the happy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that is now in our hands, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to apprehend that we shall quickly fall again under it. The Scene that has been lately acted in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> has given us sufficient warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what we ought to expect when we fall under such <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> who will neither remember <hi>Ioseph,</hi> nor the most signal Services that can be done them, nor have any of the tendernesses of Humanity, not to say of the Compassions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, but who will by a slow oppression eat out the Estates, and spoil the Houses of those they call Hereticks, and give them all the vexatious disquiet that they can contrive; and then, when all is consumed, will separate the nearest Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and throw them into terrible and noysome Prisons, without any regard to Age or Sex, to Sickness or Infirmity: And the very attempt of flying away from so dreadful a Misery, will be made a Crime to be punished by the greatest severity to which men can be adjudged; to be chain'd to a Bank, and to tug at an Oar, in the most uncomfortable state of life that is imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

This is what many thousands in <hi>France</hi> have suffered, and still do suffer; and has driven vast multitudes out of their Countrey from their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Families, naked almost, and destitute of all things: you have seen so many crying Instances of this Cruelty, that it is not necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large further upon it: and you have received, and relieved them with such a bountiful hand, and so tender a Charity, that you have reason to hope that there is a Blessing reserved for you, proportioned to the labour of Love you have shewed, who have ministred to so many of our persecuted Brethren, and still do minister.</p>
            <p>We here, had formerly reason to have looked for no better usage; we know their Church is Uniform in her Proceedings against Hereticks; the Spirit and Principles are the same every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; so we had no reason to have expected to be exempted from the fate of others, if we had been delivered over to them whose tender mercies are cruel. We saw that they remembred not <hi>Ioseph,</hi> not only in the Age after he was dead, but that immediatly after the greatest Service that could be done, and the most solemn Promises that could be made, all was forgotten: and if there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at any time any relenting, it was like that in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for when <hi>Pharoah</hi> felt the weight of the Divine Displeasure, he was so far wrought on, that he was willing to let the People go; but that Terrour was no sooner over, than his heart was hardned; so that his good Temper went off, and all his Promises were forgotten. Some, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64579:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are so foolish as to imagine, that present Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes may have wrought a Change somewhere, and that they now see past Errors, so that they would not venture to fall again into the same Follies, that have proved so fatal to them. But yet such Persons ought to consider that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> still, and would be so still, after all the Changes of Fortune through which he could pass; Obligations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements will be but feeble things. And we must expect to be the most miserable Nation under the Sun, if after the Escape that we have made, we should again fall back into the same Hands; not only the old Crime of Heresy must be brought against us, but our Presumption in daring to set our selves free, and to accept of the Deliverance, which God has so wonderfully wrought for us, would be thought the greatest of Crimes, and be aggravated by all that could be invented to make it look odious. We have in such a Case the most deplorable State of Misery imaginable to look for, all the Hardships of Prisons, all the Cruelty of rough Treatment, and after the lengthned Misery of ill Usage, such a terrible Death, as they may think, will give us the most exquisite Misery; so that all the Ease and Pleasure we might hope for, should be to be speedily delivered by a quick Execution out of their Hands; their Temper and Principles are of themselves cruel enough, but when these are sharpned by Resentment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, then new Contrivances of Cruelty are to be expected.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Egypt</hi> out of which we are delivered, I wish I could say delivered. Alas, <hi>Ireland</hi> is not! but is still in Bondage with her Children, and like to be

a long Scene of Blood and Misery, nor can our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance be compleat till that is perfected; and tho we here are not at present in their Power, yet it is but too evident that many wish we were. If these were the avowed Members of that Body, it ought not to surprize us, but that many who seem zealous against it, should yet by their whole Conduct be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying us back thither, is more amazing. Can any Man be so void of Understanding, as to forget so soon what was so lately done? or imagin that any Change in the Affairs of our Enemies, can have changed either their Principles or their Hearts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be to the worse? And yet after all this there are not a few, that say plainly, <hi>Would to God we were in</hi> Egypt <hi>again, for it was then better with us than it is now.</hi> Others are not so sincere as to speak out, but their Actings speak for them. Some are uneasy, because they can no more persecute their Brethren. Others, because they can no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult over their Neighbours. Some are afraid of suffering a little of the great deal they deserve: While, on the other hand, others are acted with another Extream of Fury, and under the pretence of punishing past Errors, seek only to gratify their own Revenges, and so drive others to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Folly of all that are in any present Danger, to wish for any thing that may deliver them from that, how fatal soever it may prove afterwards.</p>
            <p>These unruly Agitations of Mens Minds on both hands, are the very Plague that our Enemies ought to wish to us, that while <hi>Pharaoh</hi> pursues, we may stand still quarrelling with one another till he can overtake and destroy us; and thus, instead of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

            <p>The Second Circumstance of the Affairs of the <hi>Israelites</hi> was, That they were upon the Point of being redeemed out of their Bondage, and being made one of the most Glorious Nations that ever was: The Prophecy relating to it was near the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Period; and it seems it had begun already to be understood, that <hi>Moses</hi> was to be the Person to be imployed in it, for we find here that he imagined they had known it, which shews that it was got even then into many Hands. And now if we turn this towards our Selves, here is a Dawning to a Happiness, and a Deliverance begun, that carries with it all that is desirable to us. Whether this is a beginning of that great Restitution of all Things, which is supposed to be held forth in Prophecy, and to be near its accomplishment, is that which I will not undertake to affirm; but this is certain, that since the first beginnings of the Reformation, the Face of the Times never looked so bright towards that blessed Work as it does at present. There was never such a happy conjunction of Interests among those who professed it, as there is at present; nor were ever these Kingdoms, and the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> in such a close conjunction as they are at this Day. And on the other Hand, the great Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Protestants has, by his Violence and Injustice, raised against himself so strong an Alliance of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the same Religion, that it is visible the Signs of the Times give us all the grounds of hope that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64579:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we can propose to our selves; nor can any thing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint all this, but first our Sins that may provoke God to appear against us, and then our mutual Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities and Quarrellings that may distract us at Home. If Men will forget their present Danger, and only think of former Provocations, if both Sides are studying to aggravate Matters one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and seeking and improving all the Advantages they can find; if the repeated Interpositions of Him, to whom, under God, we owe our present Quiet, and our late Deliverance, cannot inspire us with sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Thoughts: If, I say, we continue firm to these ill-temper'd Resolutions, What must the conclusion of all this be, but the Ruin of Religion, and the loss of Liberty? We will appear to all the World, as well as to all succeeding Ages, the most unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the most blinded Nation under Heaven, the least sensible of Religion, and the least capable of Liberty; that have not the regard due to the One, nor the sense and the vertue necessary for the Other; and that after all the noise we have made about Religion, that we have none at all; and that after all the Concern we have shewed for Liberty, we neither deserve it, nor can maintain it. Upon our Behaviour at present depends all the Prospect that, humanely speaking, we can possibly have of our Religion's not being wholly extirpated, at least in all these Parts of the World. If in this Fermentation and Crisis the Design miscarries, there is nothing so black and dismal, as that which we ought to look for. We will be despised by all our Enemies, as much as we are now hated by them; we will fall unregarded and unpitied; and if such a Misery is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64579:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reserved for us, we shall have one aggravation of it, that as the damned in Hell are supposed to curse and reproach one another, so if we fall again into a state of Persecution, both Sides will be reproaching, and next to cursing one another for it. Weaker Minds will be struck with this, that the miscarriage of so great a Design, that was carried on so far with such unlook'd-for Successes, looks as if God had only let Things go so far of our Side, that all the World might see in our mismanagement of them, that we are under a Curse which no Successes could remove, and under a Madness that was pass'd all Cure. What prospect can we have, or whither can we so much as think of flying, if our present Settlement should be overturned? The view is so terrible, that if that should happen, the Thing which next to it a good Man would chiefly fear, must be his own out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living it, and not perishing in it; since after such a Miscarriage, nothing beside Miracle could retreive that, without which Life would be a perpetual Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to a wise or a good Man. These are not Words of Pomp, nor the undue Aggravations of a Misery, which can never be fully exprest in words, and which I pray God may never be felt in deed by us.</p>
            <p>At such a Time as this, is it fit for us to raise up into our Thoughts the unreasonable remembrance of all the Errors and Follies into which the Weakness and Credulity of some may have led them, who yet as soon as they saw how they had been deceived, seem'd sensible of former Faults, and stood firm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards? If, I say, all these Things are to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassed with rigour, how can it be hoped that Mens Minds should ever be setled or freed from those
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64579:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Apprehensions that may tempt them to think of securing themselves at any rate? And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, Men whose Passions have once so fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly misled them, as not only to be concerned in the shedding of Innocent Blood, but in the exposing the whole Nation to be destroyed, ought not to suffer the like Passions to return afresh upon them, to the keeping up and heightning our Differences, and to the reviving our Animosities, by a pretended Zeal for the Church, which they have once already endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to the highest degree; it were more modest and becoming in them to be silent and retired, than to study still to trouble our Waters, and to sow the Seeds of new Dissentions among us, and so commit new Faults instead of repenting of old Ones: all these indecent Errors of all sides concur, to let us see how far we are yet out of the way, and give us reason to conclude, that our Deliverance was too quickly wrought for us; that we were not long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in distress, and that we are not yet wholly purged from our Dross, but that we must go thro a fiery Trial, which will either purge us more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, or consume us quite.</p>
            <p>But if after all that Heat which we are raising in our selves, or in others, we would grow so calm and so wise, as to remember that we are Brethren, this would quickly give us another view of Things, and make us see our Madness while we are so much worse than the two Israelites in my Text, who did <hi>wrong one to another,</hi> for we wrong our selves and our common Concerns in the Wrongs that we do to one another. Are not the hard Speeches we throw out, and the severe Words that we fasten on one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64579:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
another, Injuries of a very high Nature? We first hate one another, and then study to render one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as odious, both to our Selves and to all the World, as possibly we can: We are possess'd with a Spirit of Jealousy and Distrust, which makes us easily believe all the Ill that we can hear of those that differ from us, and to create to our selves groundless Apprehensions and Fears; and when such an ill Temper has once corrupted us, we are easily led to all the Injustices that do follow Parties and Divisions on the account of Religion.</p>
            <p>God be thanked for it, that there is an end put to all Persecution in Matters of Conscience; and that the first and chief Right of Humane Nature, of following the Dictates of Conscience in the Service of God is secured to all Men amongst us; and that we are freed, I hope, for ever, of all the Remnants of the worst part of Popery that we had too long retained, I mean, the Spirit of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If this gives uneasiness to any, it shews that their Eye is evil, because the Eye of our Legislators has been good towards those, who tho they may be mistaken in their Notions, yet have still the Rights of Men and of Christians. But after all this it is to be remembred, that Men may be still Persecutors, though they are not able to persecute any longer, according to our Saviour's charging the Guilt of intended Sins on those who never acted them: for as long as we entertain Hatred and Malice in our Hearts, and wish that it were in our Power to do hurt to others, so long we become guilty before God, and so do wrong to our selves, though we are not in condition to do them any; but if we do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64579:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them all the wrong we can, we shew what our Tempers are, and that we would do more if it were in our Power. If we love to keep up old Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, or to create new Ones, if we will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to make the Terms of Communion with us as strait as possibly we can, and shut out all Persons, as much as in us lies, from joining Labours with us, because they do not in all Things think as we do: If we will by turns imploy all the Interest we have in any Turn of Government that is kind to us, to do wrong to others, either by loading them with false Accusations, by aggravating some lesser Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or by an undue prosecution of real, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of Faults; All these are the several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which an injurious Temper shews it self; and while such things are among us, we are under the Guilt that is charged on these <hi>Israelites</hi> in my Text, who though they were Brethren, yet did Wrong one to another.</p>
            <p>While we are so liberal in throwing out of Lies and Slanders, or at least, while we do so easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, and so willingly report them, we shew that whatsoever our want of Power to do Mischief may be, yet that our Inclinations are still full of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Wickedness. And while we are under the power of such ill Tempers, we are far enough from the Blessedness of Brethren that dwell together in Unity: Indeed this Disease is gone too far to admit of any other Cure, but what must come down from Above from the God of Love, through the effusion of the Spirit of Love and Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64579:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Corruption that is rooted in our Natures, is too deeply fixed there to be cured any way, but by an Interposition of a Divine Power. We see that neither the consideration of Reason nor of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; neither the sense of Honour, nor the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Danger, are strong enough to prevail over the Prejudices of our Education, or those angry Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which we have so long Cherished in our selves and in others, that perhaps we are now scarce Masters of them, and therefore since the Disease has gone so deep, we must look up to him who alone can Cure it; We must all consider, that such an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirit prevailing among us at such a time, is a plain Indication of Gods Anger that is kindled against us. Therefore before this proves our Ruin, let us all turn to God with our whole Hearts, and Repent us of the Evil of our ways, and Cry mightily to him, That so he may Arise, and Save, and Deliver us, who by our Sins and our Divisions are brought so very Low, and who must yet fall into the most abject and miserable State possible, if God do not bless us with a healing Temper, and with healing Counsels, That so we may go on to Perfection, and Compleat those Great Things which God has begun to work for us, and in which we our selves have fatally stopt the Course of his Mercy to us, and that we may both Live as Christians, and Love as Brethren; That the God of Love and Peace may delight to dwell among us, and Bless us, That this Church may become more and more, that which she truly is, <hi>The Praise of all the Churches, and the Ioy of the whole Earth,</hi> and that every one of us in our own particular may, at
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64579:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
last come to dwell in those Regions above, where all are made perfect in Love; which may the God of Love grant us, for the sake of him that Loved us, and that gave himself for us; to whom be Glory and Dominion for ever.</p>
