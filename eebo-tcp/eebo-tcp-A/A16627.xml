            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All the Ioyes we poſſeſſe by

But before the Rich

hot, and ſo waſh the place well,
rubbing it as hard as the patient
may endure it, to draw the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom

               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:4911:29"/>
Some doe preſently burne the
wound with a hot Needle or
Bodkin:<note place="margin">Actuall Cautery.</note> and it is the beſt way,
both to conſume the venomous
matter before it goe further, and
alſo to keepe the orifine open,
which muſt be ſo kept, till there
be no likelihood of venom left
in the affected part.</p>
               <p>Vpon this burning, there will
grow a cruſtie ſcab, round about
which the place muſt be ſcarrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſharp poynt of a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife,
that the corrupted bloud
may haue iſſue. And when the
ſcab is growne dry, you muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt
it with freſh Butter alone,
or freſh Hogs greaſe mixed with
it, &amp; having ſo looſened it, take it
off. All which time, the part muſt
be often waſhed with ſuch a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as I praeſcribed before: And
round about the wound, over all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4911:29"/>
the ſwelled part lay a Playſter
made of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> Wax, blacke
Pitch, and Pitch of <hi>Burgundie:</hi>
And into the wound put ſome
Lint dipped in <hi>Vnguentum Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
mixed with a little burnt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
to keepe the wound open.</p>
               <p>But if the hurt be in the face,
the actuall <hi>Cauterie</hi> or hot yron
muſt not be uſed, for feare of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a ſcarre and blemiſh in the
face for ever after. Therefore in
ſtead of that way; let ſome body
preſently ſucke the wound with
his mouth:<note place="margin">Sucking of the wound.</note> which alſo is very
good; but it muſt be done with
theſe Caveats.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Caution.</note> the ſucker muſt take heed
he haue no ſore, bliſter, nor raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

into places prepared to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> before he ſucke, he

and after, with ſallet-Oyle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> he muſt be carefull,
that he preſently ſpit out all that
he ſucketh into his mouth, and
let none of it goe downe his

another, he poyſon himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">4</note> when he hath ſucked
out all the venom; let him againe
waſh his mouth three or foure
times with the like waſhing, as

let him drinke a little
draught of the ſame, to prevent
all evill chances.</p>
               <p>But if no man will venture thus

to ſucke:<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</note> Take a Pullet or Cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,

will draw out the venom. If one
die, take another; and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
till one of the creatures out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
the labour. Then may you
bee ſure the venom is cleane

               <p>Some apply Horſeleeches to
the wound, if it be very ſmall.
But ſometimes it is ſo big, (as
when an Adder or Slow-worme
hath entred many teeth; or when
a mad dog hath made it) that the
fundament of ſuch a creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named cannot compaſſe it.
Then take a Pullet or a Pigeon,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4911:31"/>
and divide it aliue, and apply it
(while it is full of lifes heat) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wounded and grieved
place (which muſt be ſcarrified
beforehand) that the vitall heate
of that creature may draw the
venom through the ſcarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Let it be therefore bound
on, and kept there, till it be even
cold; and then apply another, and
ſo another; till (by aſſwaging
of all paines, and ſwelling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
as alſo by the quietneſſe and

the patient appeare freed from

apply Garlicke fryed with ſweet

               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:4911:31"/>
When all this is done, and now

               <p>This kinde of madneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from blacke Cholerick

Fleſh putrified, ſtinking, and full

Alſo they will drinke

drinke wondrouſly encreaſeth
blacke choler. And beſides this,
at two ſeaſons of the yeare eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

of all arguments: namely, in the

               <p>You ſhall know a Dog to be
madde,<note place="margin">The Signes that a Dog is madde.</note> by theſe ſignes. He is
affraid of Water, and at the ſight
of it, trembles and briſtles vp his
necke; his eyes are fiery and gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
he runnes to and from, and
reels this way and that way, like
one that is drunke; hee holds
downe his head, gapes with his
mouth, lils out his tongue (which
is blackiſh, or evill coloured) ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
at the mouth, and his noſe
runneth: he ſnaps and bites at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing in his way, but barkes
not at all; he couches his eares,
carries his tayle betwixt this legs.
Other Dogs (though bigger than
he) flie from him at the ſmell of
him. He takes no notice of any
friend, neither ſpareth to bite
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4911:37"/>
his owne Maſter: and being gone
out of the houſe, never repayreth
backe againe to it (unleſſe by

               <p>Whoſoever therefore is bitten

hath bitten, haue paſſed by ſo
ſuddainly, that ſufficient notice
could not be taken of him: Then
dip a little bread in the bloud of

               <p>Now the reaſon of this <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia</hi>

held to be,<note place="margin">The reaſon of <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia.</hi>
                  </note> That the venom
abuſing the Phantaſie, makes the
partie affected to haue horrid i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
of water. But ſome
ſpeciall Authors (having found
by experience that the drinking
of cold water cauſeth Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in ſuch over-dryed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſtomacks) conclude that it
is extreame paine &amp; torture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4911:42"/>
from that drinking that
ſo terrifieth them from it. And
this alſo is the reaſon why thoſe
that feare water are counted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
               <p>Therefore the water that is
forced into them ought to be at
firſt very warme, and the partie
muſt by degrees be brought to
drinke it colder and colder; ſo
likewiſe the Baths that they are
to be caſt into, ought to be in like
temper, to avoyd all cramps and
Convulſions both inward and
outward. Neither muſt there be
any Bath uſed at all (according
to <hi>Oribaſius)</hi> till twentie dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the biting, at the ſooneſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Hydrophobia</hi> (or feare of
water) beginneth not at any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time after the Biting. For
moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it followeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
dayes after; in ſome, ſeaven
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4911:43"/>
moneths; in others a whole
yeare after. Againe in ſome it
commeth within a fortnight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
According to the ſtrength
or weakneſſe of the conſtitution
of him that is bitten. For ſome
bodies ſtrength is able to reſiſt
the venom farre longer, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
weakneſſe ſinkes under it
much ſooner. Some haue their
pores more ſtreit to keepe out,
others more open to let in the
venom. Alſo ſome haue their
bloud and humours more pure
(and therefore leſſe apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection)
others more impure and
corrupt; therefore more eaſily
turned into venom.</p>
               <p>The maine generall Remedie
is by <hi>Celſus</hi> &amp; others held to be,<note place="margin">The mayne Remedie.</note>
Caſting of the Patient into the
Water before he be aware of it;
and this to be done every day
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4911:43"/>
for many dayes together: (For
that which he feareth is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Medicine to cure him). In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, if he cannot ſwim, after
he hath ſwallowed a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of the water, take him out
againe. But if he be skilfull in
ſwimming, hold him under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little while till he haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in ſome prettie quantitie;
For thus both his extreame thirſt
and feare of Water will be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
cured. But let him not be
long deeper than his noſtrills,
leaſt hee be ſuffocated. It the
Cramp or any Convulſion take
him; as ſoone as he is out of the
water, bath him all over with
Sallet Oyle good and warme;
which, as it will take away that
Accident, ſo will it alſo ſtop the
pores of the skin, and keepe the
waters cooling quality from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4911:44"/>
out againe too ſuddainly.</p>
               <p>My ſelfe (upon the ſight of a

invention.<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</note> Let the Patient bee

and tie about his necke a linnen
cloth doubled and caſt into the
forme of a hollow Baſon (as you
would make him looke like the
ſigne of St. <hi>Iohn Baptiſts head in a
platter)</hi> the cloth muſt firſt be
dipped in Oyle and Waxe well
mixed together, that it may hold
water like a Baſon: Then let one
with an Ewer or Pitcher poure
water gently into the cloth, till
the water riſe up to his noſtrills,
where through it may enter into
his body (if he will not open his
mouth) whether he will or no.
Keepe the Water ſtill at that
height with continuall ſoft pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4911:44"/>
in, til he hath drunke a good
draught: onely ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
ſo much as to maintaine
his breathing. Thus haue I out

               <p>Yet this is not all that muſt be

Some uſe to keep their children

when any one is ſo found,<note place="margin">The way of Recovery.</note> the
firſt thing to be done is to turne
his feete upward, his head and

the water may come out of him

not to caſt out the water, and the

through wanton rowling

ſo compreſſing or thruſting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the necke of the windepipe
