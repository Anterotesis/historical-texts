            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>eart and life, the due counterpane of his various dealings. Providence hath of late wrought wonders of mercy, as in theſe Nations, ſo particularly in this City and throughout this Land. The Lord hath remembred us in our low eſtate, becauſe his mercy endures for ever. Who is ſo great a ſtranger in our Iſrael, that obſerved not the dreadfull ſymptoms of threatned ruine to our Religion, and all our Liberties Sacred and Civil? Hath not God ſaved us with a <hi>notwithſtanding,</hi> by the late diſpenſations of his gracious appearances in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtraights and perplexities? Were not the mountains of ſinfull provocations and ſtrong oppoſitions raiſed up to their height, to obſtruct the great work of Reformation, ſo happily begun, and ſo ſolemnly engaged for among us? Had not the Romiſh Emiſſaries and Ingeneers of darkneſs prevailed far, to divide and diſtract, to delude and deſtroy us? Were not the hopes of our Common Enemy exceedingly raiſed up, gaping for the confuſion and diſſolution of Chriſts intereſt and People in theſe Nations? Had not the powers and policies of Hell prevailed far, and laid the very necks of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy and Miniſtry upon the block of direfull Anarchy and Arbitrary rule? Were not all foundations religious and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick ſo put out of courſe, in all Relations, as to threaten eminent ruine both to Church and State? Which Ordinance of God was not ſlighted, oppoſed, maligned and ſcorned by ſpecious pretences and ſtrong deluſions? Were not Gods own people very deeply guilty of apoſtacie and hypocriſie, of unfaithfulneſs and breach of Covenant in all Relations? Were we not all ready to devour one another by ſinfull miſtakes and wofull miſcarriages, whilſt our ill neighbours were laughing at us, and combining againſt us? Did not unclean ſpirits range and rage among us, poſſeſſing many, foaming out their ſhame, torturing ſouls and all ſocieties with deadly convulſions? Were not our diſtempers, perſonal and publick, grown ſo inveterate, ſo complicate, &amp; ſo multiplicious, that our beſt Phyſicians could do little elſe then pity &amp; bewail our expiring Liberties? Was not the name of Chriſt, and whatſoever is dear unto his people, ready to be made the ſcorn and prey of our ill neighbours? Were we not haſtning to the ſad Cataſtrophe of the German Tragedy, and <hi>Munſters</hi> deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, procured by the like fanatick ſpirits, which then obſtructed Reformation work? What cauſe then have we to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the miraculous patience and bounty of our God, that have made us now the living monuments of undeſerved Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Should not we adore and celebrate that good-will of his, who dwelling in this Buſh, hath thus prevented the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption thereof? He that is our God, now appears indeed to be the God of all ſalvations, to whom belong all iſſues from death. He hath delivered, he doth deliver, in him we hope that he will ſtill deliver. Thankfulneſs to him, verbal &amp; actual, cordial and conſtant, will be the beſt preſerver of mercy, and improver thereof. The choice circumſtantials of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſo many, and ſo remarkable, that the ſenſe thereof cannot but engage and inflame our hearts to the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of gratitude and praiſe. That ſuch a God, ſo highly provoked, ſhould ſhew ſuch favor, to ſuch an unworthy people, in ſuch a ſeaſon, and by ſuch means, in ſuch a manner, and to ſuch an end, this indeed is the wonder of Mercies, the complex and complement of Free-grace. That ſo great a change ſhould be brought about with ſo little noiſe, ſo little bloud, ſo little oppoſition, and ſo hopefully; Is not this a miracle of Mercy? This day of ſmall things ſhould not then be deſpiſed, being the Lords doing, ſo marvellous in our eies. Though our Redemption be not yet perfected, yet do we ſee cauſe abundantly to provoke all Chriſts friends to ſolemn Acknowledgments. Should not they praiſe him, that have been ſeeking him? Do not the Signal returns of his mercy challenge proportionable returns of our Duty? Is not this the beſt way to aſſure and increaſe, to improve and haſten the bleſſings promiſed and begun? Doth he not command and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch a courſe? hath it not been his own and his peoples method in all former ages? Have not we received notable experiences ever ſince the begining of our famous Parliament, to direct and ſtrengthen us thereto? Doth not the poſture of Gods reforming people, ſo ſignally foretold <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. challenge this from us? Thoſe very perſons who have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſeduced into ſnares and illegal Engagements againſt the ſupreme Authority, may in this great <hi>Turn,</hi> find ſufficient ground of bleſſing the Lord, that they have been ſtopt in ſuch a career, poſting to confuſion. To be thus kept from ſin and ruine will be then known and acknowledged for a ſingular mercy; when the Lord ſhall pleaſe to remove prejudice and pre-ingagements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all Gods people in this City and throughout</hi> Ireland <hi>may orderly concurr in all humble return of praiſe to our good God, on this account; it is therefore ſeriouſly recommended and deſired, That</hi> Tueſday <hi>next, being the 3. of</hi> January 1659, <hi>be ſet apart and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly obſerved as a day of publick Thanks-giving within the City and Liberties of</hi> Dublin; <hi>and the</hi> Tueſday <hi>fortnight, next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, being the 17. of</hi> January, <hi>to be likewiſe obſerved for a ſolemn Thanks-giving throughout all the parts of this Nation; and the ſeveral Miniſters of the Goſpel in their reſpective places are deſired to give publick notice thereof, on the firſt Lords day after the receipt hereof.</hi>
