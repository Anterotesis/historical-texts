         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>All thoſe of higher or levell ground, ſhould throw downe water, to run to the place where the fire is, and there to ſtop it: and others to ſweep up the waters of kennells towards the fire. If water-pipes run through the ſtreets, you may open it againſt the houſe that is a fire, and ſet another pipe in that upright, and two or three foot lower then the height of the head of the ſame water, ſet in ſome gutter, trough, or pipe unto the upright pipe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay the water to the fire, for under the foreſaid height, it will run it ſelfe from high ponds, or from Sir <hi>Hugh Middletons</hi> water, or Conduit-heads, or from the Water-houſes, without any other helpe, into the fire, as you will have it: you may keepe great Scoopes or Squrts of wood in houſes; or if you will, you may have in the Pariſh a great Squrt on wheeles, that may doe very good ſervice.</p>
               <p>Where milde fire is, milke, urine, ſand, earth, or dirt, will quench it: but any thing elſe ſet a-fire by that, will be quencht as afore: if there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houſes ſtanding together, and are indangered by a mightie fire, before it can be quencht, or choaked with earth, then you may pull downe the next houſe oppoſite to the winde, and then earth and rubbiſh being caſt upon the fire, and round about it, will choake the violence of the fire: beſides the water you may get to doe the like. Alſo it is neceſſary that every Pariſh ſhould have Hookes, Ladders, Squrts, Buckets, and Scoopes in a readineſſe upon any occaſion.</p>
               <p>O the miſeries of Cities, Townes, Villages, and particular houſes, that have been burnt, where ſome could not recover their loſſes in thirtie yeares after, and ſome never, which have been lamentable ſpectacles unto us, when many men, women, and children, have been burnt in their houſes; and multitudes of people utterly undone, that ſaw all their wealth burned before their eyes. Beſides, many have been hurt, many kild, aud many burned, that came but to helpe to quench the fires. What lamentable cryes, frightings, and amazements, there was to all ſorts of people, ſome ſicke, ſome in child-bed, and ſome great with childe, to the terrour of them all: and all was through the miſeries of fire, that came by careleſneſſe and wilfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the very ſight of fire and Candle, put us in minde to prevent the like miſeries that have come by fire, both in <hi>London,</hi> and the parts of <hi>England:</hi> for great winds may riſe ſuddenly, and enemies furies, may doe miſchiefe. To maſter the Elements, is either to increaſe or decreaſe any of them; for as ayre makes fire increaſe; ſo earth will choake it; and water will quench it.</p>
               <p>Preventions of fires, would ſave the often Collections of money in all Churches in <hi>England;</hi> all which is for the profit and ſafetie of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. As good order, and care, prevents our feare of fire; ſo a good life, prevents the wayes to ſinne. And every one, mend one; then all will be mended.
