            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A Doctor of Divinity in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s days that had been ſufficiently perſecuted and plundered for his Loyalty to his Prince, which made him and many others (that held his Tenets) to talk at random ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when they had nothing to loſe; but this talking of his happened to be a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to him: for divers did acquaint <hi>Oliver,</hi> that he was often heard to ſay, that he did heartily wiſh that <hi>Oliver</hi> and all his Army were in Hell: upon which <hi>Oliver</hi> ſent him a Summons to appear before him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, VVhy how now Doctor, ſays he, I did never expect to hear ſuch Language to have proceeded from a man of your Coat?

                  <p>A Gentleman in <hi>North-wales</hi> was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Sun-ſhiny day, upon a high rock near the Sea-ſide in thoſe parts; and as he was looking about, he ſaw an Iſland ſome Four miles from the ſhore or thereabouts, upon which Iſland he ſpy'd two Hares play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with another: <hi>Well,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are you got over there now; for</hi> I <hi>am ſure</hi> I <hi>cours'd you both yeſterday with my two Greyhounds, and then you ſhew'd me a trick, but now I'll ſhew you one.</hi> So he went immediately home, and fetch't his two Greyhounds, and a great Morter-piece which he had of a Thouſand pound weight, which he faſtened between the two Dogs Necks; but he was forc'd to faſten a Cord to it alſo, leſt the Dogs might run away with it; and when they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd it to the Rock aforeſaid, he charg'd the Morter-piece, and preſently the two Greyhounds ſlipt into it (for it ſeems they had been uſed to it) which two Greyhounds he ram'd in very well, and then diſcharg'd the Morter-piece with no hurt at all to the Greyhounds, (for you muſt know he ſhot with white Powder) and it ſo happened
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32985:59"/>
that ſays he, I <hi>proteſt t'ye Gentlemen, (upon my honeſt word and credit 'tis true) that the two Grey-hounds each lighted upon a Hare as they were playing, and then kill'd 'em and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately left the Iſland, and ſwam through the Sea with the Hares in their Mouths, which were one boiled and t'other roaſted for my Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> The one askt him what colour his Greyhounds were? He ſwore they were both black before, but the White Powder did ſo change their colour, that they were both turn'd grey; and ſo from them all of their kind were called Grey-hounds, for their ſakes, to this day. They told him they thought this probable enough to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. <hi>O Gentleman,</hi> ſays he, <hi>far be it from me to tell you a lie, for if you won't believe me, pray ask the two Dogs,</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32985:60"/>
Jade, and unwilling that his Maſter ſhould loſe) for if he did, he thought he ſhould fare the worſe for it at night; preſently caſt me off his back, and leapt quite tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Coach himſelf (notwithſtanding it went a great pace) but it was done ſo nimbly and ſo dexterouſly, that all admir'd, and ſo well 'twas ordered, that juſt as he came thorow the Coach, when he came out, he catcht me directly upon his back agen on the other ſide of the Coach, and though 'twas done ſo haſtily, yet the other got ground of us; but my Horſe ſo handled his Legs, that without Switch or Spur I won the wager. Now, <hi>ſays he,</hi> ſhew me ſuch a Galloway Nagg in <hi>England</hi> agen; then they all told him 'twas very much, and more than they could have believed, if he had not told it.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32985:60"/>
Three broad, and ſwore that the leaſt ſtring upon it was bigger than his Thumb. Then they askt him how it poſſibly could be plaid on? He told them that a Man and his Wife that were Gyants (of which there's abundance in that Country) had Two large Iron Bows, made each with Eight Feet like Gridirons, with which he and his dear Conſort (which I think is the beſt name for her now, in regard of that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick) ſcrat o're the ſtrings; that is, ſhe on the Treble part, and he on the Baſs, whil'ſt Eight great Maſtiff Dogs ran up and down the Frets of the Lute, with their bare Feet, and ſtopt directly in Tune as they plaid; (but you muſt conceive that theſe Dogs were bred up to't, or elſe 'twere a thing impoſſible) to the admiration of all ſtrangers that were there; and the Caſe of that Lute ſerved for a Kennel for the Eight Dogs to lie in: but it ſeems 'tis common with them there, for they made nothing of it: and this he made good by whole volleys of thundering Oaths.</p>

could not be heard till Nine days after, when it chanc'd to thaw: which one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hearing, ſaid 'twas a brave Country to ſpeak Treaſon in; for whatſoever a Man ſaid, a Man could not be heard: Nay, the very lowings of the Bulls and Cows were froz'n up alſo, that the owners had much ado to find them to fodder them, for want of hearing them as formerly. Nay, by your favour, <hi>ſays another,</hi> there is another Country, which had as great a conveniency to ſpeak Treaſon in as that had from 1648 to 1660; and there one might ſpeak any ſort of Treaſon, and was never call'd to an account for it: Nay, the more Treaſon they ſpoke, they were the better eſteem'd; ſo that there was no need of a froſt at that time in <hi>England</hi> for that uſe.</p>

his death: though he lingred Fourteen or Fifteen years after it; he I ſay, riding that night, came to a Common, where were great ſtore of very good Cole-pits, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he fell down to the bottom in one of them, and his Horſe fell directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; that it was impoſſible at that time of night, and in ſuch weather, to be relieved in that great diſtreſs: and having lain ſo for a long time, and no hopes to be relieved at all, he preſently bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and immediately roſe and went to the next Village, and there borrowed a Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe and a Spade, and then came back with 'em to the Pit, and firſt digged out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then his Horſe, and ſo about five a Clock in the Morning came home; but ſo weary and ſo cold, that he could not unbotton his Doublet: Nay, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> after I had hope him off with all his Cloaths; he was ſo benum'd, that I was forc'd to take a Warming-pan of hot Coles, and ſo went all over his body, yet was he ſo cold that he ſcarce felt, though the warming-Pan ſometimes ſtood a pretty while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place; which truly Gentlemen I was fain to do for my Dear Husband: which confirm'd them in the belief of it, that it was as true as any of the reſt, and gave her thanks for it alſo: and ſo ſhe made

I was once in ſome company where I heard one of them ſay that to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Raven would live a hundred years: ſo the next day I went and bought me one purpoſely to make a Tryal, and put him into a Cage and taught him to ſing; and I think in my conſcience no Bird but a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven could ſing like him. Well, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I kept this Bird above a hundred years; nay, if I ſhould ſay two hundred, I ſhould not lie (and fed him all the time my ſelf) yet I could never make him ſpeak as your Starling does for my life; at laſt being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tame, I turn'd him out of the Cage, and put him into a Room, where I had only a Gooſe, but never a Gander for her: I know not how it happened, but the Raven and the Gooſe fell in league together (for you muſt know 'twas a Cock Raven) and the Raven trod her, and ſhe brought ten young ones, all coloured half black and half white, and thoſe Five which were black
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32985:63"/>
towards the head cry'd juſt like a Raven, and thoſe that were white towards the head, cry'd like Geeſe, and I eat one of the former, that was black towards the head, and if you'll believe me, I have had ever ſince ſuch a ſtrange croaking in my Stomach, eſpecially if I chance to ſee any Carrion, that 'tis a great diſturbance to me: Nay, One of my Neighbours upon ſome occaſion call'd my Wife Carrion; and though I did not love her before; yet ever ſince I have had a great kindneſs for her. Then they told him that the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſtory made it true, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb makes it good, that is, <hi>'Tis not ſo ſtrange as true,</hi>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32985:63"/>
think, I wounded a great number alſo; then they wondered how he could kill ſo many at one ſhot, he told them that there were near Four hundred little holes in the Barrel of his Gun, ſo big as Shot might eaſily paſs through them; and at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Gun every Shot went out at his own hole, and kill'd ſo many as I told you, I am certain: Nay, I had kill'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more if they had lay a little cloſer: Then they askt him how he got 'em home, he told 'em he went home firſt and fetcht a Horſe, which was loaded Three times home with them, beſides what I carried on my Shoulders; and they were all as fat as the driven Snow. They ſaid 'twas very much indeed, and very many to be kill'd at one time.</p>

their Shares, and ſo fared the better; and to the confirmation of it added ſome luſty Oaths: Nay, ſaid they, we'll believe this, cauſe 'tis a well-bred ſtory.</p>

It fortun'd that the Gentleman having occaſion to ride abroad on him, came to a River that was about Twenty yards wide, which you'll ſay was very broad; yet this poor beaſt leapt with him to the very brink of the River on the other ſide, and there by chance lighted upon a ſtump of a Tree, which run into his Belly: which the Maſter ſeeing, alighted, and ſo left the poor Beaſt in that condition, yet would not kill him, and ſo went away.

late Horſe, which he thought had died there; ſo they cut off all the Boughs, which were ſo many as to load almoſt three Carts, and then he took the poor Beaſt home, and cur'd him of all but the ſtump of the Tree which was in his Belly: and indeed he need not do it, for he receiv'd a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it every year, that is, at leaſt Two or Three load of Wood, which ſerv'd him to burn in his Chamber; for he would never burn any other there but that, out of the love he bore to that poor beaſt of his.
