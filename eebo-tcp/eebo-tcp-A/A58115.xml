            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>WEll; Now's your time, (my Masters of the Pit)</l>
            <l>You that delight in Women, Wine and Wit.</l>
            <l>All things this Winter jump for your delight,</l>
            <l>In Mirth to wear the day, in Love the Night.</l>
            <l>Now Fop may dine with Half-wit ev'ry noon,</l>
            <l>And reade by Satyr, or his worse Lampoon.</l>
            <l>Julian's so furnish'd by these scribling Sparks</l>
            <l>That be pays off old Scores, and keeps two Clarks.</l>
            <l>My Lady, with her eldest Daughter, brings to town</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Rent, and vows she'll not go down</l>
            <l>So long as her Sir <hi>John</hi> is worth a Crown.</l>
            <l>The Theatres are up, and, to their cost,</l>
            <l>Must strive, by Victory, to please you most:</l>
            <l>Both he's and she's must stretch, in hopes to gain,</l>
            <l>Like your <hi>New market</hi> Racers on the Strain.</l>
            <l>Faith, give us Iockey-law without deceit,</l>
            <l>Mark the mens inches well before their beat,</l>
            <l>And let the Women have their Horse-mans weight.</l>
            <l>For, Gallants, many of your Nymphs are come</l>

            <l>Good News for you that love a Boosy Life,</l>
            <l>And hate the Lectures of a carefull Wife.</l>
            <l>That jointur'd Monsion never gives content</l>
            <l>Like the convenient modish Tenement</l>
            <l>That's held by moderate Lease or yearly Rent.</l>
            <l>But if with me Misses would counsel joyn,</l>
            <l>We'd make the Tenant pay a swingeing Fine.</l>

            <l>She proves the Turn of her uncertain Fate.</l>

                  <p>I have consider'd that point too, and am convinc'd that an old man
can never love an old woman, that's for certain. Age is a sure decayer and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96624:5"/>
renders men backward in their duty, therefore I marry a woman so
young, that she may be a temptation to me when I am old. You may
talk of Amber-cawdles, Chocolate, and Jelly-broths, but they are nothing
comparable to youth and beauty, a young woman is the onely provocative
for old age, I say.</p>

                  <p>There you are short of comprehension agen: why, a young wife
that has wit would play the Devil with an old Husband. Why, you see a
young one can hardly keep 'em from kicking backward in this age.</p>

                  <p>That I might be sure not to be troubled with a witty, wife, I made
choice of a Girle of four years of age, one that had no signs of a pregnant
wit, her father and mother were none of the wisest; they dying, left this
child to the care of her Aunt, a good honest decay'd Gentlewoman, but a
little soft too; her portion they recommended to my hands, to be improv'd
for her use; I plac'd the Aunt and child in the Countrey, at a lone house,
instructed her to breed her up in all honesty and simplicity immaginable;
never to let her play amongst Boyes or Girles, or have any conversation
with any body but her self, and now being bred to my own humour, and
moulded to my turn, I am going to reap the fruits of my long care and
trouble; for this is she I design for my wife.</p>

                  <p>Yes, but those fools, if not meer Idiots and Drivelers, grow wiser
by experience, and by that time they come to twenty years of age are quite
other things; this forward age ripens them apace; Girles now at sixteen

                  <p>O much rather than be a slave to a wife: A witty wife is the

to deceive a man, and cloak her villany so cunningly, a husband must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be upon the spy, watch when he should sleep, seem to sleep when he

                  <p>If my wife was a fool, I should always suspect her a whore, for
'tis want of wit that makes 'em believe the flatteries of men; she that has

                  <speaker>Ram.</speaker>
                  <p>I am pursuing an intreague, a new Mistress, <hi>Frank.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Town.</speaker>
                  <p>An intreague! thou art alwaies upon intreagues; I never knew
any of your intreagues come to any thing; there's no fellow in Town has
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96624:7"/>
been so bawk'd as thou hast, in all thy adventures; you see I never make it
my business to look after women, and yet they fall in my way, and I am
successfull, whereas thou art always coursing 'em about, and when you are
at the very scut of 'em, thou losest 'em.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ram.</speaker>
                  <p>The truth is, I have been unfortunate hitherto, I always meet
with occasions, but never bring 'em to perfection; yet it is not my fault
neither, for either my mistress jilts me, fortune jilts me, or the Devil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
me, I can never bring it to a home-push; when I think I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all difficulties and am as sure of a woman as a Hawk is of the prey he
swoops at, Fortune turns her wheel, a whirlewind blows my Mistress into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
and I am tost into <hi>America.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore prethee leave hunting, that difficult game, and learn
of me to divert thy self with a bottle, leave enquiring where there's a pretty
woman, and ask where the best wine is, take women as I do, when they
come in thy way by accident; you will never be successfull so long as you
make it your business; Love like riches comes more by fortune than indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>

                  <p>Never till you make drinking your chief diversion, O <hi>Ned,</hi> wine
gives a certain elevation of spirit, quickens and enlivens the fancy to that
degree, that a man half bowsy shall advance farther with a woman in one
encounter, than a sober fellow as thou art in ten, there's a certain bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

lukewarm when she was just boyling o'r.</p>

                  <p>No, I have seen her often in a Vizard at Playes, she has a delicate

and if her skin all over be like that, Snow was never whiter, nor Alaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

                  <p>No, no she had Rings and Jewels too valuable to be one of those,
she was Roguish but not Impudent, Witty but not Rampant; without
doubt she has a husband that is proud of her, and takes delight to hear her
talk, for I observ'd kind of City Elder always sit a little distant from
her, who listen'd to her rallery with the Sparks, and seem'd pleas'd in his
countenance when she was smart in her Repartees upon the little Cockerills
of the Pit that came flirting at her with their sparring blows.</p>

                  <p>I was humming a new Song one day in the Pit, and she ask'd me
if I could give it her. I had it written down there, I presented the book to
her, but could hardly force it on her, because she thought it of some value.</p>

                  <speaker>Ram.</speaker>
                  <p>I am glad to hear her Character, and now am more dissatisfi'd that

how constantly he came to Church, where, but for your sake, I dare swear,

abilities: Whilst I was a Scholar at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I studied a very mysterious
Art, and spent much time in the contemplation of <hi>Magick,</hi> which the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
call the <hi>Black-Art;</hi> for this I was expell'd the University. I can perform
something wonderfull, yet without danger, and to morrow or any time
when you and your Lady are at leasure, I will show something of my skill
for your diversion.</p>

there is one in the house that knows the <hi>Black-Art.—Iane,</hi> besure you
lay my Prayer-book under my Pillow to night.</p>

                  <p>Fear not Lady, you shall have no hurt from me—it is very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
—sometimes—I can by my Art discover private enemies, reveal Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
help right Owners to goods stolen or lost; to Ships becalm'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a wind shall bring'em to the Port desir'd—and the like.</p>

                  <p>I am concern'd at this mistake, which was occasion'd by the Orange

and began to riflle my pockets—knowing I had this purse of Gold
about me—I slid from 'em upon the ground as far as I could, and strugling
with 'em, found my feet in at a Cellar window, and crowded my self as
far in as I could to scape from 'em, or at least, to secure my pockets. Finding
this, the Rogues let go their hands from my mouth (which till then was
stop'd) to pull me out, that they might get at my money—But I cry'd
Thieves, which the Watch presently hearing, away ran the Rogues, and so
I sav'd my money.</p>

                  <p>It was a very strange accident last night—I cannot but think on't.
I would fain know the riddle—I can't imagine how it came about.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ramble,</hi> when he comes, will inform you all: I look'd out
at window, and saw them both go away together—they were old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>

                  <p>I hope the Gentleman, who e're he was, had bravery enough to
evade the acknowledgment of what pass'd—</p>

                  <p>I fear Mr. <hi>Ramble</hi> over-heard too much—and that was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
he drew his Sword.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eug.</speaker>
                  <p>Worst come to the worst—if I cannot cover it with denials, he
must acknowledg it but a mistake; and himself in the fault.</p>

his coming: I do not yet comprehend the meaning of this stranger, <stage>[Jane <hi>ex.</hi>
                     </stage>
What made him so curious to spy into secrets of the family the first night
of his coming? there is a mystery too in that—here he comes—
now I'll dive into that matter.</p>

                  <p>Madam, good morrow to you, I have watch'd your Husband's
going out to get an opportunity to speak with you in private. Nay, blush
not, Madam, at any thing that pass'd last night; what knowledge I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
of your secrets, lyes bury'd in this breast, the frolique I play'd last night,
was harmless, and for mirth-sake, and such, as I hope you can freely pardon.</p>

there was no ill intended by that Gentleman's being there, but your disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

suspicion.</p>

                     <hi>Eugenia,</hi> Marriage has intitled you your Husbands, your duty and

                  <speaker>Eug.</speaker>
                  <p>As your due?—I confess you have plaid the Spy, and know my
secrets, therefore may think to make me comply, and to keep me in aw by
threatning to discover last nights transactions to my husband, but that is a
poor design.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Love.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Lady, I scorn that, I have better pretensions and a Nobler

                     <hi>Loveday!</hi> is it you? forgive my excess of wonder; your growth

                  <p>How young and innocent were we in our first Loves—and all
our vowes sincere—but time and absence has effus'd them quite, and your
heart has taken new impressions. O, <hi>Eugenia,</hi> 'tis death to me to see you,
and not to see you mine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

which never was quite extinct, for still it lies hot and glowing at my heart.

though you are married, and your person is your husband's, I
claim a share in your affections, since wholly I cannot enjoy you, allow
me what part you can. I cannot live without your kindness, and since
your inclinations to a Gallant, are partly privileg'd by the constraint of
your marriage,—I claim that title.</p>

                  <speaker>Eug.</speaker>
                  <p>I confess I once lov'd you, nor had my affections ever abated, but
from report of your death; the sight of you revives them agen—
be you discreet, and I cannot be unkind.</p>

                  <p>I took it from a youngman that had been his servant at <hi>Hamborough,</hi>
—He desirous to return to live in <hi>England,</hi> obtain'd it from his Master, to
recommend him to your husband.—Coming in the same Ship together, I
learn'd from his discourse he depended on Service, and what provision he
had made for his reception here—I receiv'd him into mine, took this
Letter from him with design to personate him here, which has succeeded so
fortunately, as once more to introduce me to the presence of my dear-long-lov'd

                  <p>Nothing of harm to either of 'em—But Alderman <hi>Doodle</hi>
brought him news from Change that there is a Ship come up the River, in
which they both have very great concerns—I cannot tell you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
but a messenger is come on purpose, from the master of the Ship, to
desire 'em to take Boat and go down this Tide—I suppose some seisure
of prohibited goods or the like, I did not enquire into the matter—but
they must go.</p>

you agen.—Adieu my <hi>Peggy.</hi>

                  <p>You are a fine man indeed, marry a woman to make a fool of her—
you shall learn her more wit, or every wife in the Parish shall be her School-Mistress.</p>

                  <speaker>Wise.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, your husband here may doe what he please with you—Let
me alone to give my wife what instructions I think fit—I'de fain see what

                  <speaker>Dood.</speaker>
                  <p>Why look you, my wife has a good forward wit of her own,
and needs but little admonition; but you shall hear now what I say to my
wife—Well, dear, I sent for thee to let thee know I am going, and to
take my leave of thee.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Arab.</speaker>
                  <p>Thank you, husband.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dood.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, wife, I need give thee no instructions how to behave your

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Arab.</speaker>
                  <p>I warrant you, husband, I have wit enough not to doe my self any
harm; and for any I doe you, I have wit enough not to let you know it—and
there's an old saying, husband, <hi>What the eye sees not, the heart
grieves not.</hi>

                  <speaker>Arab.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore, husband, as business calls you from me, I think it my
right to bid you make haste back agen; for though you carry the Key of
your Treasure with you, yet you cannot be secure, since every man has a
Key fitted to the same Wards.</p>

and I have only one thing to request of thee.</p>

                  <speaker>Dood.</speaker>
                  <p>Only this—That till my return, to all impertinent men, that
ask you any questions, or talk to you, answer 'em all with No—Let
'em say what they please, let your answer still be, No, no.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Arab.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, husband, I guess at your meaning; and till I see you agen,
I will be sure to Sing no other tune to any manner of man but, No,—
<pb facs="tcp:96624:33"/>
all that I answer or say to 'em, shall be nothing but—No, no, no.</p>

                  <p>Yes. <hi>Arab.</hi> And a wiser course than you have taken, I hope, that
leave your wife to walk about your Chamber all night in Armour, like an
Enchanted Knight upon Fairie-ground.</p>

will resolve to go in and go to Bed to her, dissemble my grief and seem
content—though it will be a sharp corrosive to my mind..., ha! here
comes a Gentleman, It may be my Wife's Instructor—I'll stand by and
observe if he hanckers about my House or leers up at the Window, that I
may know him another time.</p>

                  <p>Handsome or not I don't know, for she was muffled up in her
hoods, and I could not see her face. But I have had three or four hours of
the sweetest enjoyment Man ever had with Woman.</p>

such things to her that if she answered <hi>no,</hi> it would please me well.</p>

                  <p>I had the happiness to tumble this Lady's Bed some hours, behav'd
my self like a Man,—found her brisk and active, but on a sudden she rises
from me, plucks me by the elbow to get up, then blind, me with her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief,
leads me out of doors a good way from her house, gives me a turn
round, and slips away from me;—when I perceiv'd her gone, I pluck'd off
her handkerchief, thinking to see where she went in, that I might be so
happy to find this kind person another time,—and turning back methought
I had a glimps of her, but running after her stumbled against a great Stone,
fell down, and so lost sight of her.—</p>

                  <p>Yes Sir, For when I waken'd, I was so pleased with my Dream,
and so possessed with the Fancy, that immediately I got up and went to the
place where I dream'd I fell, to see if there was any such stone as I tumbled
at, and if I found such a stone, to look if there were any such House there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
as methoughts I saw her slip into just as I fell.</p>

                  <p>By your leave Sir, you told me that you put a Ring upon the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Town.</speaker>
                  <p>I did so; now it work'd strongly in my Fancy, that if I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad

other would befall me thereabouts.</p>

—I was this night to have gone to <hi>Gravesend,</hi>—and as I was taking leave
of my Wife, a Frolique took me in the head to make her promise that if
any Gentleman should talk to her during my absence, or ask her any questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Dream out.—</p>

Friends of mine at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> who went lately from <hi>England</hi> told me
since she was Married to you, she had forfeited my good Opinion, and lost
her virtuous inclinations—as they supposed, disgusted with her Marriage.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this I resolved to know, purposing never to Marry, nor
put trust in woman-kind if she was false; But now I am assured of her
Vertue, I will pursue my intentions of coming over, and Marry with
speed.</p>
