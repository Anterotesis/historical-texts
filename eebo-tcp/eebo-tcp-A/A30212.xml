            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Some proceedings at <hi>Bedford,</hi> pursuant to the late Act of Parliament,
(a true Narrative whereof is herein enclosed) afford matter both of
wonder and dislike to such that have observed them. When you have
perused the Paper, you will conclude with me and others, that this Text needs
no Comment; it is plain, that in despight of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to all Laws and Rules of Righteousness, Neighbourhood and Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they resolve to ruine the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> though the Instruments are
no wayes able to recompence the King and Kingdoms damage thereby. The
Sufferers are chearful and peaceable; their immediate Persecutors are the
scum of the people, and chiefly the appurtenants of the Commissaries Court.
The most forward Instrument of that sort is one that hath openly avowed
and declared his esteem for <hi>Popery</hi> above other Religions. If some check
be not given to these Extravagancies, many Families will suddenly be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the publique Trade and Welfare endangered, which the Interest
of some, the Rage, Revenge and Enmity of others will not admit regard to.
Pardon this trouble, when I have told you the particulars of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
are all true, and will be proved in every part. So I have remaining
at present only to tell you, I am, Sir,</p>

            <head>The NARRATIVE.</head>
            <p>ON Lords-day (<hi>May</hi> 15.) at the dwelling-house of one <hi>John
Fen,</hi> a Haberdasher of Hatts, many persons being assembled
for Religious Exercise; One <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Feckman</hi> (two Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors
) by a Warrant from one Mr. <hi>Foster,</hi> who is a Justice
of Peace, and the Commissaries Deputy, did enter the House, and
force the Meeters to Mr. <hi>Fosters</hi> House, who fined every one of them
severally, according to their reputed abilities; and committed the
Preacher to Prison, for words he spake against the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
then occasioned by the discourse of Mr. <hi>Foster.</hi> The Apparitors
charged (by vertue of their Warrant) a Constable, and a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden,
to assist them; but they neglecting, (being not willing to
the work, as they themselves declared) were fined each of them five
pounds; though by intercession of friends, the Fines are not yet
levied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65697:3"/>
On Friday following, one <hi>Thomas Battison</hi> another Churchwarden,
and the most active and busie in the work, having with much labour
and difficulty called together the Overseers of the Poor, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables
of the several Wards, to levy the several Fines upon the Goods
of the Meeters, did fitst attempt to levy the Fine of Ten pounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Goods of one <hi>John Bardolf</hi> a Maltster, who having sold all his
Malt before the Act commenced, and delivered his Malt and Malt-house
into his possession to whom he had sold them, none of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
would joyn with <hi>Battison</hi> to break open the Door of the Malt-house,
or to distrain the Malt, though he most importunately charged
and besought them to do it, promising to bear them harmless.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Battison</hi> and the other Officers were debating in the open
Yard before the Malthouse Door, a great number of all sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were gathered about them, expressing (by turns) their indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against him, for attempting this against <hi>Bardolf;</hi> whom the whole
Town knew to be a just and harmless man; and the common sort of
people covertly fixing a Calves tayl to <hi>Battisons</hi> back, and deriding
him with shouts and hollows, he departed without taking any distress
there; and advanced with other Officers to <hi>Edward Covingtons</hi> Shop,
a Grocer, to levy five shillings, for his Wife being at the Meeting,
where none of the Officers would distreyn but <hi>Battison,</hi> who took a
Brass Kettle, but when he had brought it to the street-door, none of
the Officers would carry it away; neither could he hire any to do it
in two hours time, though he offered money to such needy persons
among the company as wanted bread; At last he got a youth for six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to carry the Kettle less way than a stones-throw, to an Inn-yard
where before he had hired a Room to lodge such Goods, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to lodge Grain: but when the Youth had carried the Kettle to
the Inn-gate, (being hooted at all the way by the common Spectators)
the Inn-keeper would not suffer the Kettle to be brought into his
Yard; and so his man set it out in the middle of the street, None re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
it, till towards night a poor woman that receiveth alms was
caused by an Overseer to carry it away.</p>
            <p>From hence, <hi>Battison,</hi> with the rest of the Officers at his heels,
proceeds to distrein one <hi>John Spencer</hi> a Grocer, for a Fine of Forty
shillings; but his Shop-door being lockt, <hi>Battison</hi> could not prevail
with the Officers to joyn with him in breaking it open: and so this
day ended, without any other distress than that of the Kettle.</p>
            <p>The next day, which was the Market-day, the Justices under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
how <hi>Battison</hi> was discouraged in his work by the backwardness
of the other Officers, and the open discountenance of the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65697:3"/>
commanded the Officers to break open the Doors, and levy the
Distresses, and promised them to bear them harmless: Immediately
old <hi>Battison,</hi> with a file of Soldiers and the Constables, in the middle
of Market-time advanced again to the Malt-house of <hi>John Bardolfe,</hi>
(scituate in an Inn-yard in the middle of the Market-place) and
breaks open the Doors, but not without long time and trouble, all
people refusing to lend either Bars or Hammers, which they sent from
place to place to borrow for that purpose: When the Doors were
broken open, <hi>Battison</hi> distreyned fourteen Quarters of Malt, but it
was night before he could carry them away; for though the Market-place
was then full of Porters (it being a great Corn-Market) yet
none of them would assist, though charged strictly by <hi>Battison</hi> and the
Constables, but ran all away, and left their Fares; some of them
<hi>saying, they would be hang'd drawn and quarterd before they would assist
in that work;</hi> for which cause the Justices committed two of them
(which they could take) to the Gaol.</p>
            <p>The next day, being <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> Fines were doubled upon the
Meeters, before the first could be levied; for they assembling again
at the same House, according to their custom; <hi>Battison</hi> with the two
Apparitors, by another Warrant from Mr. <hi>Foster,</hi> entred the Meeting-place
about nine of the clock in the morning: but the Mèeters refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to depart before their Exercise was ended (unless forced) <hi>Batti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
sends word of it to Mr. <hi>Foster,</hi> who returns a verbal Order, that
<hi>Battison</hi> should charge certain Gentlemen of the Town (whose names
he had sent by the messenger) to assist him; which <hi>Battison</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
did, going to their Houses to call them, though there were near
a hundred common people spectators in the streets, and none of them
then charged to assist, and also Trained-Band Souldiers ready in
Town for this service, partly at the charge of these Gentlemen whom
<hi>Battison</hi> had so warned to assist, and who were so warned (as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
) upon design, to have them incur the penalties of five pounds
for their refusing. About ten of the clock in the morning the Meeters
went with <hi>Battison</hi> and the Apparitors (being constrained so to do)
to the <hi>Swan</hi> in <hi>Bedford,</hi> where being kept till four of the clock in the
afternoon, and their names taken by the Justices, they were set at
liberty.</p>
            <p>Next morning Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> the Justice appears early in the streets,
with old <hi>Battison</hi> and the two Apparitors, a file of Souldiers and some
Constables, to see the Fines levied upon the Meeters Goods; charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his assistance such persons he sees, and sending for others to
their houses, but got few or none besides his first company; most of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65697:4"/>
the Tradesmen, Journeymen, Labourers and Servants having either
left the Town, or hid themselves, to avoid his call. The Town was
so thin of people, that it looked more like a Country Village than a
Corporation; and the Shops being generally shut down, it seemed
like a place visited with the Pest, where usually is written upon the
Door, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Distress was attempted upon the Goods of one <hi>Nicholas
Hawkins</hi> a Cutler, who was fined forty shillings; but his Goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
removed beforehand, and his House visited with the Small-Pox,
the Officers declined entring. Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> meeting here on <hi>John
Croker</hi> (that was also fined three pounds) commanded his assistance;
who refusing, was therefore by Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> commanded into the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of one of the Town-Sergeants, then present.</p>
            <p>From hence Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> went into the House of one <hi>Michael Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi>
a Shoomaker, who was fined five shillings; where a Distress
was made, not only for five shillings, but also for 12d. more; because
the said <hi>Shepheard</hi> being asked the same time by Mr. <hi>Foster,</hi> if he was
at Church the day before? and not answering, only desired to know
who accused him, or would swear it.</p>
            <p>The next House in their way was one <hi>Thomas Honyloves,</hi> a Journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
-Shoomaker, fined twenty shillings or more; whose Children
lying sick of the Small-pox, in the House where his Goods lay, the
Officers were unwilling to enter, and so Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> drew them off to
one <hi>Thomas Cowpers</hi> a Heelmaker, fined forty shillings; distreyning
three Cart-load of Wood, cut especially for his working; which was
of more value than any of his houshold Goods, he being a poor man,
and living only upon making Heels and Lasts.</p>
            <p>The next remove was to one <hi>John Crokers</hi> House before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a Dealer in Linen Drapery, and fined three pounds; who having
removed his Shop-Goods to another place, to secure them from the
Distress, old <hi>Battison</hi> would not trouble himself to distrein then, but
said he would take a better opportunity to get his Goods.</p>
            <p>Near this place lived one <hi>Daniel Rich,</hi> a Tanner, and Constable of
that Ward; who being fined five shillings for his Wife, had his best
Wearing-Coat distreyned the same time, by immediate Order of Mr,
<hi>Foster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> marcheth to <hi>John Spencer,</hi> a Grocer; whose
Goods he distreyned for a Fine of about forty shillings. The next
Neighbour was <hi>William Jay,</hi> a Baker, who was also distreyned for
five shillings. And next to him lived one <hi>Edward Isaae,</hi> a Blacksmith,
fined forty shillings for himself and his Wife; from whom they took
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65697:4"/>
away Locks, Shovels, and the very Anvil upon which he forgeth his
Work; and <hi>Battison</hi> would have pulled down the Forge-Bellows also,
but that it required more time and labour, than his itch to greater
prizes in other places would allow him: Hastening therefore to their
Market, they leave (for a time) the Parish of <hi>Pauls,</hi> invading the
Parish of <hi>Cuthberts;</hi> where they find the door of one <hi>Thomas Arthur</hi>
a Pipe-maker, locked, who was fined five pounds; before they had
broken the door open by attempts they made at it, the same was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked
on the in-side; Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> enters, and distreyning all the
Goods within doors and without, the said <hi>Arthur</hi> desired to know,
how much Money he had distreyned for? to whom the said Mr. <hi>Foster</hi>
replied, that they distreyned for eleven pounds: thereupon <hi>Thomas
Arthur</hi> desired to see the Warrant; which being produced, he seeing
himself therein but six pound, told Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> so: to which M. <hi>Foster</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>that there was five pound more for keeping his Door locked.</hi> When
<hi>Thomas Arthur</hi> perceived that Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> would distreyn all his Goods;
he said, <hi>Sir, What shall my Children do, shall they starve?</hi> Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>that so long as he was a Rebel, his Children should starve.</hi> And so
on Wednesday following, old <hi>Battison,</hi> the two Apparitors, with a
File of Musquetiers, and a Cart, carried away what Houshold Goods
they thought fit, and all the Wood both within doors and without,
necessary to his Trade, by three Cart-load, not leaving so much as to
suffice for the burning of a Kiln of Pipes, ready set, though earnestly
desired by the poor Pipemaker himself, and also by others of <hi>Battisons</hi>
Company. <hi>Mr. Foster</hi> having done his Work at the Pipemakers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in the Parish to one <hi>Robert Browns</hi> a Gardener, distreyning all
his Houshold Goods, for a Fine supposed to be three pounds: making
haste to the chiefest place they aimed at, for their turn, they passed
into <hi>Peters</hi> Parish, to the House of Mris. <hi>Mary Tilney,</hi> Widow, a
Gentlewoman well descended, and of a good Estate, who was fined
Twenty pounds; and to make her exemplary in suffering for that
offence, Mr. <hi>Foster</hi> himself, being attended by his Publick Notary,
will see the Fine effectually levied upon her Goods; and indeed the
same was effectually done; for (a Cart being provided for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
) they distreyned and carried away all the Goods in her House
they thought worth their labour, as Tables, Cupboards, Chairs, Irons,
Feather-beds, Blankets, the very Hangings of the Room, and the
Sheets off her Bed, insomuch that the Widow was forced that night
to borrow Sheets of her Neighbours to lie in, being not willing to
lodge out of her own House, though invited by her friendly Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
; nor did they leave her one Featherbed of her own (having
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65697:5"/>
taken three away) whereon to spread those Sheets she borrowed, but
she was forced to make use of a Bed and Bolster of anothers, left in
her House: It is true the Gentlewoman had more good Houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff
of her own, than was at this time found in her House; but
foreseeing the Waste intended upon her, prudently secured the best
of them abroad; and therefore cannot with safety possess them for
her necessary use: And as for the value of those Goods taken away,
it is supposed to be betwixt forty and fifty pounds. Yet the said
Mris <hi>Tilney</hi> was more troubled at the crying and sighing of her poor
Neighbours about her, (who were much affected with her sufferings,
she being very charitable) than for the loss of her Goods, which she
took very chearfully. And so the Officers left her, having finished
this dayes work.</p>
            <p>The next day, being Tuesday, more Fines were to be levied on
the Goods of the rest of the Meeters; but <hi>Battison</hi> finding it would
lie hard upon him and the two Apparitors, for want of more help than
they had the day before; and fore-knowing that if he deferred charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Assistance till he began his work, all people would get out of the
way, as they did; Therefore early in the morning he walked alone in
the Streets, looking into the Shops, to charge men beforehand to be
ready: Which being soon perceived by the people, most of the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and other Inhabitants, instantly either deserted the Town, or hid
themselves as before. About ten of the Clock, old <hi>Battison,</hi> with the
Souldiers, and some Constables, whom he had warned over-night to be
in readiness, marcheth up the High-street; where he levieth the
Fine of five pounds upon <hi>John Fen,</hi> the Haberdasher of Hatts before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
at whose House the Meeting was; taking away all the
Hats in his Shop, and the next day carted away his Houshold-Goods,
because there was but twenty nine Hats in the Shop, beside Hatbands,
that they took away. Having thus dealt with this Hatter, he proceeds
to deal the same measure to another Hatter, one <hi>Samuel Fen,</hi> who was
also fined five pounds, and dealt with as his Brother before him,
finding no more favour from them than the former.</p>
            <p>The next Fine they proceed to levy, was forty shillings upon the
Goods of one <hi>Thomas Woodward,</hi> a Malster: but one <hi>Richard Layfield</hi>
being in possession of the Malthouse, to whom the Maltster had (some
time before) sold all his Malt, and quitted the possession; Old <hi>Battison</hi>
met with a stop, and was perswaded to defer distreyning, till <hi>Richard
Layfield,</hi> who had bought the Malt, had spoken with the Justices, then
met at the <hi>Swan:</hi> forthwith the said <hi>Layfield</hi> applyed to the Justices,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cquaints them that <hi>Thomas Woodward</hi> (<hi>bona fide</hi>) did owe him sixty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65697:5"/>
pounds, that he had formerly lent him in money, and that the said
<hi>Thomas Woodward</hi> was bound to deliver two hundred ninety odd quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Malt to others, for Money and Barley received of them;
and therefore upon condition that the said <hi>Layfield</hi> should acquit him
of the said sixty pound debt, and oblige himself to deliver the two
hundred ninety odd quarters of Malt to the several persons interessed
in them, he did sell and deliver to him the said <hi>Richard Layfield,</hi> all
the Malt lying in his Malthouse, and Barley left, and that there was
no fraud herein; All the persons to whom the two hundred ninety
and odd quarters of Malt were due, were ready to make oath of the
truth of their Debts; the said <hi>Richard Layfield</hi> did also produce the
Deed to the Justices, and averred that the reason of making this Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
was to secure his sixty pound, which he thought might otherwise
be hazarded. But notwithstanding all this, Sir <hi>George Blundell,</hi> one of
the Justices, said; That <hi>Richard Layfield</hi> went about herein to defraud
the King, and therefore bound him over to the next Assizes; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said, that so long as <hi>Thomas Woodward</hi> aforesaid offended, the
Malt should be distreyned, and that he would leave them (meaning
the <hi>Meeters</hi>) worth nothing; And when he had done that, he would
fill the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isons with them: adding moreover, If they do not like it,
<hi>Let them stand up and defend themselves, as we did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were no further Distresses made the last week; it is conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that some falling out betwixt the Mayor and <hi>Mr. Foster</hi> on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday,
was the occasion to delay their proceedings; It seems the
Mayor was not willing that <hi>Battison</hi> (who is Churchwarden for <hi>Pauls</hi>)
should distreyn in the two Parishes on the other side of the River
where the Mayor lived: But on <hi>Monday</hi> the 30th instant, <hi>Feckman</hi>
the chief Apparitor, with the Churchwarden, Constable, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer
of <hi>Mary's</hi> Parish in <hi>Bedford,</hi> began to distrein. The persons
name is <hi>Joseph Ruffhead</hi> at whose House they first began; the Fine
they levied upon him was three pound; the said <hi>Ruffhead</hi> upon their
approach to him desired to see their Warrant, wherein not finding
<hi>Feckmans</hi> name, he discharged him from coming upon his Ground,
and therefore was had to one of the Justices; before whom making
good his practice in keeping <hi>Feckman</hi> from his Ground, because not
in the Warrant, was told by the Justice, that <hi>Feckman</hi> came only as
an Assistant to the Officers. Whereupon the said <hi>Ruffhead</hi> returning
back permitted them to take their Distress; who took two Timber-Trees
of about seven pound value, for the three pound. The same
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65697:6"/>
day the same Officers went to distreyn one <hi>John Clerke,</hi> a Grocer, for
forty shillings; and breaking open his Doors, they took his Houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goods,
not medling with those in his Shop, being but of little value.
And from thence the same Officers went to the House of <hi>John Rush</hi>
Waggoner, to levy a Distress of three pounds set upon him, where
they seized a new Cart and Wheels for the same.</p>
            <p>The same day at part of a Village called <hi>Cotten-End,</hi> near <hi>Bedford,</hi>
the Officers of the same, by Warrant from the Justices, distreyned
several persons, who had been convicted by the Justices, for having
a Meeting at the House of one <hi>Thomas Thorowgood;</hi> which persons were
fined to a greater value than the whole of their Estates did amount
to; and this day they are stripped of their whole substance; and the
said <hi>Thorowgood</hi> hath not left him so much as his Loom to work with,
being a Weaver; and by his labour therein supporting himself and
his Family.</p>
            <p>But because there are several remarkable Circumstances relating to
this matter, which do clearly evince the undue and most inhumane
dealings of some of the Justices, especially of Sir <hi>George Blundell,</hi>
with the poor people last mentioned; here is therefore inserted a
particular and exact Account of the whole Proceeding, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>From the discourse of a little Child, who said there had been a
Meeting at the House of <hi>Thomas Thorowgood</hi> in <hi>Cotten-End;</hi> the Wife
of <hi>John Pryor</hi> Victualler, resorts to Sir <hi>G. B.</hi> and makes Oath of the
Child's Report to her, who issues a Warrant for the appearance of
several persons of that En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ship, suspected to have been there, who
appeared before several Justices at the <hi>Swan</hi> in <hi>Bedford,</hi> before whom
none that were examined confessed a Meeting to have been, or that
they were there: the Justices dealt with them severally, assuring them
that such of them as would confess who was the Preacher, should be
acquitted: but no confession was made; and generally they did refer
to any proof that could be brought against them, not being willing
to accuse themselves or others. The Justices upon consideration did
conclude, that there was ground sufficient to convict them; and did
assess Fines upon them severally. <hi>Thomas Thorowgood</hi>'s Fine (at whose
House the Meeting was said to be) was Nineteen pounds; who was
by the Officers distreyned, and all that he had, with the Implements
of his Trade (he being a Weaver) taken from him, and the said
<hi>Thorowgood</hi> with his Wife is since departed away from their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65697:6"/>
The Wife of one <hi>George Winright,</hi> and a Son-in-law of <hi>Winrights,</hi>
were fined ten pounds five shillings, as having been at the Meeting.
The said <hi>George Winright</hi> is Tenant to the Earl of Exeter, and being
in Arrears of Rent to his said Landlord, about <hi>Michelmas</hi> last, for his
said Landlords security of receiving Rent then due, and such further
as for the year ensuing would be accrewing, the said <hi>Winright</hi> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with two Sons-in-law of his, to become bound for him to the
Earl's Steward, then upon the place, for his quarterly payment of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
due; and for the indempnity of his two Sons, in respect of the
said Bond, the said <hi>Winright</hi> by Bill of Sale passeth over all his Goods
and Chattels to the two Sons, one whereof lived with him, in the
possession of what was so sold, from the time of the said Sale; but it
happened that the Son who lived with him, staying out from home
at a Fair the third of <hi>May,</hi> kept at a Village about two miles from
<hi>Cotten-end,</hi> the Father-in-law took such displeasure that he broke open
the Son's Coffer standing in the House, took out the Writing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
it: the Son remains still with his Father, and was fined ten
pounds for being at a Meeting. The Father pleads there were no
Goods of the Son's there, though they were once his with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yet the Writing was since destroyed, and sets forth the matter
of Fact. The cancelling of the Writing was deemed Collusion, and
the Officers were ordered to proceed in the Distress. <hi>Winright</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
driveth away his Cattel, sells several of them at <hi>Potten Market,</hi>
and some not sold there, he sells to one <hi>Miller,</hi> an Inhabitant of the
same Parish, for a valuable rate; who paid good part of the money,
and gave Bond for the remainer to <hi>Winright</hi> (the said Cattel being in
<hi>Miller</hi>'s Grounds and Possession several dayes) which being heard of,
Sir <hi>G. B.</hi> sends a Warrant for both the Buyer and Seller to appear
before him, to whom they gave information of the sale and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But all their Pleas being unregarded, the said Knight demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sureties of them for their appearance at the Assizes, declaring
with his wonted vehemence he would bind them both over, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyn
the Cattel likewise: whereat the said <hi>Winright</hi> being affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
promised to pay the ten pounds, and accordingly did so; but
some few dayes after, being told by a Lawyer that he had wrong in
so doing, he repairs to Sir <hi>G. B.</hi> acquainting him with what the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
had said, entreating his favour: which without delay he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
beating him well for his pains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Langley,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Cotton-End,</hi> likewise being fined
five pound ten shillings, for his being at the aforesaid suspected
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65697:7"/>
Meeting, presuming upon the favour of Sir <hi>G. B.</hi> (to whom he stood in
late relation as a Servant) told the Officers <hi>he would pay the money, if
he could not get abatement of Sir G. B.</hi> to whom repairing, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
for any such-like kindness, he was unwilling to pay the said
Fine, having very little Stock, and owing for the greatest part of
that, and much likewise in arrears to his Landlord: but the Officers
having strict charge to go take all he had, and sell it for five pounds
ten shillings, they distreyned his three Cows, really worth ten pound,
and going to sell them, a Neighbour in compassion to the Distreyned,
paid the Officer five pound ten shillings, and sent the Cows home to
the right owner.</p>
            <p>Some other persons of the said Endship were distreyned by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and had that little substance they had taken from them, and
deposited by the Officers in the house of the aforesaid <hi>Pryor,</hi> whose
Wife did at first inform of the said Meeting, where they yet remain
to be sold to any willing to buy the same, that with the proportion
allotted to the Informer, the said <hi>Pryor</hi> may again have some money
to put into his purse, having prodigally and brutishly wasted all, that
he lately sold a considerable Estate for, that lay in the aforesaid End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A true Relation of the sudden and strange Death of one Feckman, a
malicious Persecutor of the good People at Bedford.</head>
               <p>Of a like complexion with that beastly creature <hi>John Pryor,</hi> last
mentioned, was one <hi>Feckman</hi> a most violent and thirsty Persecutor
at <hi>Bedford;</hi> whose father living at <hi>Turvy</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford,</hi> left
him a very considerable Estate, who at his marriage did receive a
good addition thereto, by a Portion with his Wife; but giving no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to his lusts and extravagancies, in some few years he had spent all,
and for his last refuge became an <hi>Apparitor,</hi> to which the calling of
an Alehouse-keeper being by special favour added, he by the gains
from both was enabled to live as a Hous-keeper in <hi>Bedford;</hi> but at
the coming forth of this late Act, he blessed himself with the hopes
of recovering an Estate, and raising himself a Fabrick out of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of those whose kindnesses had refreshed him; and pursuant to
this purpose, he engages with all his might both in taking the <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and levying the Distress upon their Goods; in the former, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting
more than usual diligence; and in the latter, expressing
extraordinary rage and violence, so that by his fierceness and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65697:7"/>
(wherein he seemed delighted) he appeared rather a Purveyor
for, and a resemblant of Satan, than an Officer of a Court Christian
(as some men stile the Commissaries.) But some few dayes after,
<hi>viz June</hi> 3. 1670. at a Visitation (where he, as a necessary and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
Appurtenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was attending) at <hi>Ampthill,</hi> he was taken there
ill, and coming thence to his home, fell very far amiss, issuing blood
in great abundance both by vomit and seige, continuing so to do till
his death (which was the 5th day after his first sickness) during all
which time he was in very great pain and anguish of body, and for
the most part unwilling to speak, and not very sensible, sometimes
speaking words of threatning against <hi>Phanaticks;</hi> and sometimes bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Mr. Foster</hi> for setting him in the Office. After whose Death his
Wife, in complyance with her Husbands desire of being buried at
<hi>Turvey,</hi> endeavoured to borrow a Coach of the Neighbour Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to carry his Corps; but all that were asked, refused to lend;
and the two Carriers who live in the Town (each of which keeps two
Coaches, that they let for Hire to persons desiring them) did both of
them refuse for hire to let theirs for his conveyance; so that his wife
was constrained to send his Corps in a Cart to the place designed for
his burial.</p>

            <head>A POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>THis Instance of the Execution of the late Act against Meetings
for Religious Worship, is not thus made publick, as though
there were no other of the same kind in other places; For it is well
known that in many of the principal Cities and Towns in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there have been proceedings on the same account, with no less
Outrage, Illegality and Violence; which may in due time be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
also: only this is one of the first, whose Tragical Acts have
been collected, every particular whereof will readily be attested
on Oath, by those that suffered, and others who were spectators of
the whole proceeding. Nor is the design of publishing hereof, to
cast any reflection on the Act it self, let it stand or fall in the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, as it shall be found complyant with, or opposite to, the
Honour and Interest of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> with the Peace, Welfare and
Prosperity of the Kingdoms. Councels for publick good, are the
Province of our Superiours; ready Obedience, or peaceable Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65697:8"/>
are the lot of private men: But least of all is there any design
in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> to insinuate further discomposures into the minds
of men than what are already evident, or to attempt a disposal of
them, into irregular, and disorderly actings, to the disturbance of the
Publick Peace: This indeed (as it appears in the <hi>Narrative</hi>) some
of their Adversaries do openly declare, that they would willingly, by
their unjust and oppressive usage of them, hurry them into. But all
endeavours of that kind will be in vain, and the hopes of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, wholly frustrate. For as this People, by their peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
for many years together, have given all the satisfaction,
that any men in the like circumstances are able to give, of their
harmless and quiet inclinations; So they intend not (by the Grace
of God) to gratifie their Adversaries, by transgressing the obligation
of their own Consciences unto peace, and all due subjection unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.
It is nothing else but the Authority of God in their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which imposes a necessity upon them to practise those things
in their Christian Profession for which they are made obnoxious to
so great sufferings, and gives them a supportment under them. The
violation thereof, by any disorderly and seditious behaviour, to the
disturbance of the Publick Peace, would be at once, to renounce the
Principle of their Actings, and to deprive themselves of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of their Sufferings. Nor do they in the least suspect, that the
Declaration of their Resolutions in this kind, will prompt many to
renue and multiply their violent proceedings against them, upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of freedom from opposition; None but vile and ignoble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
will entertain a thought of so doing, upon such grounds; Wise
and generous Persons will rather take hold of it, as a fit and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
occasion, to exercise their clemency and forbearance. And
indeed all unquiet storms, thundrings and lightnings, are in and from
the lower Regions; but amongst the higher Spheres and more Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Bodies, all things are alwayes peaceable and serene, and by their
influences are the other raging and noxious disturbances quell'd and
scattered: and such an end do we hope and pray for, of our present
disquietments.</p>
            <p>The ends therefore of publishing this Account are plainly and only
these: First, to prepare others, of the same way and practice in the
things of Religion, with the persons so roughly treated at <hi>Bedford,</hi> not
to think strange of the like tryals when they befal them, and to bear
them patiently, quietly, and peaceably, notwithstanding all provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the contrary, as they have done. 2dly, Humbly to demand
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65697:8"/>
of our Legislators, whether this be the Garment of their Off-spring?
It doth not appear that there is any thing in the Act it self, that doth
direct to, or will bear any man out in, such an execution of it, as that
which is here most truly and impartially represented. And we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the secret intentions of some, ought not to influence Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Administrations, wherein all are concerned. And it may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become
the wisdom of those who have Power, speedily to revise those
Laws, which may easily be perverted, so as to give too much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
unto, and be made instrumental in, gratifying the lusts and
revenge of private men. 3dly, To give a clear prospect into the
sad Effects of the Prosecution of this Act, in the way and manner
as hath herein been made known; in which it appears, that there
hath been very little regard to Law, Equity, Peace, Love, Humanity,
or indeed any thing that is desirable or useful among Mankind. It is
evident already, how that by these means, no small Disturbances, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
and Confusions, have filled the minds, and exercised the
thoughts of all sorts of men; some forsake their Callings, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
in them; in which number are not only the Prosecutors of this
Act, and those prosecuted by them, but others also, who withdraw
themselves, or forsake their Habitations, that they may have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in these proceedings, or at least not to contribute their
Assistance in them. Poor industrious Families are utterly ruined, and
some made wholly incapable to provide for their future subsistance,
(the Utensils and Implements of their respective Callings (contrary
to Law) being most barbarously taken from them:) And besides all
this, opportunities are hereby given to Thieves and Robbers to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
their Villanies, with pretences of executing this Act, which
have actually by some already been made use of in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> not
far from the Town of <hi>Hartford;</hi> the truth whereof will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon enquiry. Moreover, also, the minds of the residue of men
are filled with mutual Animosities, Heats, Jealousies and Suspicions,
things no way conducing to publick tranquillity and advantage, And
all this is brought about by this only means; And that too in a time
otherwise of the highest peace, calmness, and sedateness of mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all sorts of people throughout the Nation. Whether these,
and innumerable other evils of the like kind, will be recompenced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdom, by the satisfaction given to the envy and jealousies of
some men, (whose usefulness unto themselves is very well known, but
not so as to the Publick advantage of the Nation) Men wise, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and sober, will in their own minds judge and determine.</p>
