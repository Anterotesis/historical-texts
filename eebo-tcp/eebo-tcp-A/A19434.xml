            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nouember in the twilight, was slaine by Assassinates,
hired to that purpose by <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> who
then contested his right to the Regencie against the
said Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no way able to inuent any colourable varnish for
the shifting off the fact, grew bolde to maintaine in
the presence of the Princes of the bloud, and Officers
of the Crowne, that what was acted by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
was honourable and iust; and thereupon set a
worke <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> Doctor of Diuinitie, by birth a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who publikely defended, that both by the Law
of God and man, as well Canon as Ciuill, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for any man to make away a tyrant, and that by
any meanes; whereupon the matter was so carried,
partly through feare of violence, and partly by
strength of perswasion, that the course of Iustice for
that time was stopt, and nothing done.</p>
               <p>At that time there liued in Paris, <hi>Iohn Gerson</hi>
Chancellour of the Vniuersitie, a man of no meane
learning, (as that age afforded,) who strongly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himselfe to the fore-mentioned proposition of
<hi>Iohn Petit,</hi> insomuch that not long after a generall
Councell being held at Constance, <hi>Gerson</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
thither as Ambassadour from <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt,
hauing in his instructions expresse charge to propose
that conclusion to the Fathers of the Councell, by
them to be further discussed and censured: where
both parties being indifferently heard what could be
obiected on either side, the Councell in their fifteenth
Session, condemned the opinion of <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
the Canon begins thus: <hi>Quilibet Tyrannus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:24020:5"/>
plainely defining that it no way rightfully fals within
the compasse of the Subiects reach, to set vpon the
person of his Soueraigne, vnder pretence of curbing
a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>This erroneous Doctrine hauing beene now a long
time quenched as it were, and buried by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of this Councell, is now againe enlightened and
set a foote by the Iesuites, but vnder the cloake and
colour of Religion, that is to say, when it shall be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
necessarie to make away a King for the good of
the Church: to this purpose they haue published di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
discourses, in which they permit and incite the
Subiect to kill his Soueraigne, when his Regall power
degenerates into tyrannie.</p>

by which the arrest against <hi>Iohn Chastel,</hi> and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

               <p>This booke of <hi>Mariana</hi> being first printed at Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
was brought into Fraunce, about eight yeares
since, and shewed (the most seditious passages being

it, but he found meanes to excuse himselfe, and auoid
the taske, as well perceiuing that he could not oppose
himselfe against it, but withall hee must of necessitie
oppugne the Generall of their Order, the Prouinciall
of Toledo, and a many of their societie, who had their
fingers in approuing of it; but now when he sees that
through the death of the King, the Iesuites are
growne into a generall distaste, and perceiues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be pinched by the Court of Parliament, and
the Sorbon, he hath published an Epistle Dedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
in which he would seeme forsooth to condemne
<hi>Mariana,</hi> which hee performes indeede, but in such
mincing gentle termes, that a man may without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
perceiue, he feares to launce too deepe, onely
affirming, <hi>that it was the lightnesse of a soaring quill,</hi> in
stead of accusing the person of Heresie and perfidious
barbarous treason, and the doctrine of impietie, and
enmitie against God and man: but howbiet hee had
reached home in reprouing <hi>Mariana,</hi> yet now (as the
Abbot of Boys hath well obserued) the medicine
comes after the Patient is deceased: for had he done
as he ought, hee should then haue put pen to paper
when the King pressed him to it, and not suffered such
an opinion to roote it selfe in the mindes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which for want of weeding out at the first, at

Concluding with a prayer to God, <hi>that it
would please him graciously to accomplish that which mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
he had begun:</hi> this speach was imprinted at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
by <hi>Nicholas Neuil,</hi> and <hi>Rollin Thierry,</hi> Printer to the
holy Vnion, together with the approbation of three
Doctors, <hi>Boucher, Decreil, Ancelin:</hi> not that I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that such impious speaches could drop from
the lips of our holy Father, but rather take it to be a
meere imposture: the Iesuites and other Doctors of
the same feather, hauing forged it, there by to make
the murther allowable, and to incite some other to
the dispatching of the succeeding King.</p>
               <p>At the same time <hi>Iohn Guignard</hi> a Iesuited Priest,
residing in Paris, at the Colledge of Cleremont, wrote
a Treatise in the praise of <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> together with
diuers motiues for the making away of the succeeding
King, who last dyed; which since too manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at the arraignment of the said <hi>Guignard:</hi> for
behold how God wrought, as the commissioners were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:24020:10"/>
busied at the arraignment of <hi>Iohn Castel,</hi> some of them,
deputed to that purpose, with-drawing themselues to
the Colledge of Cleremont, seased vpon many papers,
among which was found a Booke written by the hand
of the said <hi>Guignard,</hi> containing many arguments
and reasons to proue that the murther of the King was
iust and lawfull, together with diuers inductions, and
incitements for the making away of his Successour:
some of which I will here set downe, being copied out
of the original, which is yet to be seene among the
Records of the Court: First, <hi>that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruell</hi> Nero <hi>was
slaine by</hi> Clement, <hi>and the counterfaite Monke dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by the hand of a true Monke.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roycall
act of</hi> Iames Clement, <hi>tearmed by Diuines a gift
of the holy Ghost, was iustly commended by</hi> Burgoin,
<hi>Prior of the Iacobins, Confessour and Martyr, and that by
many reasons, as well at Paris, when he read there vpon</hi>
Iudith, <hi>as also before the worthy Parliament of Tours.</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>that the Biarnois, howbeit conuerted to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
faith should be handled more gently then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
if he had set on his head a Monasticall Crowne:
that if hee could not be deposed without warre, that
it should be vndertaken against him, and if that might
not be, he must be made away priuately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Court hauing perused these papers, and <hi>Guig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> being put to his answere, freely confessed that
they were written by his owne hands: whereupon the
Court by an arrest executed the 7. of Ianuarie 1595.
declared the said <hi>Guignard</hi> attainted and conuinced
of high Treason, condemned him to make honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
amends, naked to his shirt, the halter about his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:24020:10"/>
necke, before the chiefe doore of our Ladies Church
in Paris, and after this to be hung in the Greue, and
his body burnt.</p>
               <p>May it please the Reader to make inquirie if euer
as yet any Iesui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e were heard of, who condemned this
<hi>Guignard</hi> of treason and disloyaltie: but on the other
side, <hi>Rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ome</hi> in his Apologie excuseth him as farre
as he dare, affirming that <hi>Guignard</hi> discussed the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
propositions onely by way, and in forme
of Scholasticall dispute, and in this wee agree: for I
haue alwaies held it, that to kill a King is the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
conclusion of the Iesuits diuinitie: which position
if any Iesuite, eyther driuen to it by force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or drawne to it by shame, any where condemne,
it ariseth eyther from want of discretion, or learning,
or some such ground.</p>
               <p>The which may from thence be made to appear
in that the Iesuites haue ranged <hi>Guignard</hi> in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of their martyrs, which they haue caused to be
Printed at Rome in two formes, in the one of which
<hi>Guignard</hi> is; in the other he is left out, to the end that

howbeit without naming him, for feare belike of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending

become odious, in affirming that a Clark may kil the

that hee knew nothing of the plot, whereupon the

which was this: they lodged <hi>Hall</hi> in a chamber next

him notice that his companion <hi>Hall</hi> was placed in the

thought good, enterchange conference, which they
daily did: in the meane time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Iaylor sets some in
a close corner not farre off, to listen what their talke
was, who ouer-hearing them, by that meanes brought
their secrets to light, which they discouered in this

to the Iudges: hereupon <hi>Garnet</hi> being againe
conuented before the Court, and finding himselfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
confessed indeed that he vnderstood of the
enterprise, but it was opened to him in confession,
which he could by no meanes vnseale, there were also
produced witnesses, who deposed, that in a sermon
which he made to the Catholiques, he exhorted them
to pray God, that an important and dangerous busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

               <p>Being then demanded, wherefore hee had so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
forsworne that which now proued to be true,
he made answere, that being demanded, if hee were

thereupon was brought to confesse, that he had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a Booke of Equiuocations, prescribing therein
the meanes to cosen the Iudges by doubtfull answers,

of their Order, <hi>Aquauiua,</hi> and three other of their
Doctors, where he maintaines it tooth and naile, that
it is lawfull to deceiue the Iudges by Equiuocations,

                     </gap>n</hi> Heretiques chalked out this
way long since to the Iesuites: For <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in the
eight Booke of his Historie, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51. saith, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
hauing subscribed to the Confession of the
Nicene Councell, had another Confession hid in
his bosome, which himselfe had written, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
confidently swore to the Emperour, that
hee did beleeue as hee had written, vnderstanding
thereby the writing which hee had wrapt vp in his
bosome. By the vertue of this Doctrine, a man may
denie his Religion, his Faith, his God, and all, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Iudge, <hi>that he beleeues not in Iesus Christ,</hi> but
with this mentall reseruation, <hi>to tell you:</hi> and Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> denying Iesus Christ to the Maide, might well
haue shifted himselfe by the helpe of this Sophistrie,
saying; <hi>I know him not,</hi> but softly to himselfe, <hi>to
tell you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this subtiltie the Iesuites haue found a tricke,
how to stirre vp Instruments to assault the sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Princes, and withall to instruct them in the
meanes not to disclose their Complices, perswading
them that they may keepe their conscience safe, by
such and such Equiuocations, as to denie, that they
neuer saw it, or heard of it; alwayes prouided, that
they keepe to themselues some secret limitation or
condition, by which they may free themselues
from the imputation of a lye, and not offend their
conscience. This is it which makes the parricides
of Kings, so confidently to forsweare themselues
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:24020:14"/>
in the face of the Court, being taught by their
spirituall Guides, that in so doing, if they reserue some
other meaning in their owne mindes, it offends not
God at all.</p>
               <p>And from hence it ensues, that a man cannot fixe
any certain beliefe vpon Father <hi>Cottons</hi> protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in disauowing <hi>Mariana:</hi> for who knowes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee haue not some reseruation locked vp in his
owne breast? or who can tell whether in saying, <hi>I
condemne</hi> Marianaes <hi>bookes,</hi> he vnderstands not <hi>for not
hauing said enough:</hi> or thus, <hi>A priuate man cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
attempt vpon the life of the Prince,</hi> speaking thus to
himselfe, <hi>except the Pope giue way to it, or the King
be excommunicated, or be no true King; but such, or
such, is no true King, because he doth this or that, &amp;c.</hi>
But to conclude this point, as in contracts heretofore
among the ancient Romaines, their women were
compelled to renounce the Villeian decree, and the
authentique <hi>Si qua mulier:</hi> In like maner, Father <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> if he would haue vs giue credit to his declaration,
he ought first to haue renounced his priuiledge of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and vsing Equiuocation; and yet I feare, that in
this very abrenuntiation, hee would haue vsed some
other ambiguitie and craft.</p>
               <p>The other point maintained by <hi>Iohn l' Heureux</hi> is,
that <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> and his companions, hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the conspiracie against the life of the
King and his whole race, ought not to reueale it, but
keepe it close: he deliuers it in these termes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 262.

the Confessor must be faithfull to his Penitentiaries:

solemnly sworne allegiance; and if wee looke into
those sacred Tomes of holy Writ, we shall meet with
store of passages which enioyne vs loyaltie and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Kings, but not so much as a fillable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning
secrecie after confession: it is a precept which
the Church onely hath put vpon vs, but with this
caution, that it be not preiudiciall to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God, or that vnder the pretence of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie
we turne Traytors, and by our perfidious si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
become the cause of the murthering of our
Father or our King, which is, as if I espying one who
hastning to set fire on his brothers or neighbours
house, should quietly suffer him to doe it, because I
had promised to disclose it to no man. No certainly,
wee must beleeue that on the contrarie, rather the
breach of such manner obligations is more praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie

<hi>hold this undoubted, that all which your Superiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
is none other then the commandement of God
himselfe, and as in beleeuing those things which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Faith proposeth, you are presently carried with
all the strength of your consent: so for the performance
of all those things which your Superiour commands, you
must be carried with a certaine blind imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tuosity of will,
desirous to obey without farther inquiring why or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
And to the end that they might not finde any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
by the word <hi>quoda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> certaine impetuositie, other
passages there are in the same Epistle, where that
word is forgotten; as where he sayes, <hi>perit caelebris illa
obedientiae caecae &amp; simplicitas.</hi> For in as much as those
things which the Superiours command, might some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
seeme vniust and absurd, this Saint (though
not yet canonized) commands the Iesuites so to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuate
their vnderstanding, that they sift not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of their Superiours, after the example of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> who prepared euen to sacrifice his Sonne
at the commandement of God, and of Abbot <hi>Iohn,</hi>
who watered a dry logge of wood a whole yeare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to none other purpose but to exercise his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
and another time put himselfe to the thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
downe of a great rocke, which many men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
were not able to moue, not that he held them
things either vsuall or possible, but onely that hee
would not disobey the command of his Superiour.</p>
               <p>This rule then consequently drawes to this issue,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:24020:16"/>
that if the chiefe of the Iesuites Order, among whom
their General is alwaies subiect to the King of Spaine,
command a young French Iesuite any thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
he stands bound instantly to put it in execution,
without so much as casting an eye vpon the danger
or difficulty of it, or any way respecting how dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable
it might proue, either to himselfe or the
state. A Maxime which if it be held as sound, our
Kings shall no longer be secure of their liues, then the
Heads of the Iesuits command their vnderlings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the contrarie: for it being once commanded,
they are forbidden to enquire if the thing be iust, the
matter giuen them in charge, shall be sure to carrie
the name of the good of the Church, and be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon a satisfaction for some enormious sinnes, or
vpon the hope of being crowned Martyr, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in heauen some preheminence aboue the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie.</p>
               <p>This vow is also the cause, that the Iesuites are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from the obedience of Bishops, for it had beene
a matter meerely impossible to obey their Superiours
in all things, if the Bishops had had power to correct
or hinder that which the Superiours should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Some one it may be will tell me, that these things
are indeede cleere enough, and the testimonies suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to settle any mans iudgement in discerning the
doctrine of the Iesuites: but whence comes it to
passe (then will some body here obiect) that in some
places they condemne the murthering of Kings, and
maintaine that a subiect ought not to attempt vpon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:24020:17"/>
the person of his Soueraigne, howbeit he be vicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giuen and abuse his power: to which I answere, that
the opinion indeede of some of the Iesuites is, that a
Subiect ought not to rebell against his Soueraigne,
although he be an Heretique or a Tyrant, before the
sentence of depo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition be pronounced by the Pope,
or by some of the most learned, among which the
Iesuites euer suppose themselues to stand in the first
degree, and that by expresse declaration the subiect
may be vnloosed from his oath of allegiance, as the
Iesuite <hi>Andreas Eudemon-Iohannes</hi> teacheth at large,
in the third Chapter of his Apologie for <hi>Henry
Garnet:</hi> but they also generally hold, that after sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of deposition, which is commonly procured at
the instance of these holy Fathers, such or such a King
is no longer King, and that another ought to supply
his roome, and that his Subiects owe him no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
at all. This point is at large demonstrated
by the same Iesuite in the same Chapter, and we haue
already made it cleere, that the same is also the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
both of <hi>Ballarmine</hi> and <hi>Gretzer.</hi> Nay, France it
selfe hath by experience sensibly felt the smart of it,
to her great misery and grieuance. Now this is it
which I affirme, that whosoeuer maintaines that the
Pope can at his pleasure alter kingdomes, displacing
one, and setting vp another, and exempt the French
from their oath of allegiance, consequently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
that the French in such a case ought to kil their
King: For a man may well thinke that a King from
whom offer is made to snatch away his kingdome, will
take armes to maintaine his right, and labour to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:24020:17"/>
reduce his subiects to loyaltie, who stand armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: now in such a warre, and among so many
rebels, it is impossible that the Prince should not
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne in hazard of his life, since that in defending
himselfe he is resolute not to loose his kingdome, but
with the losse of his life: these be the nicities of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
by which they euchant men; they protest so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
that they allow not the murdering of Kings,
but herein lyes the craft, that they acknowledge none
for Kings but whom themselues please, and maintaine
that to kill a King, whose gouernment they cannot
brooke, is not to kill a King, but a man (as they say)
masked vnder that title. But yet marke here another
mischiefe, by which they are plainely conuict to be
enemies to our Kings: for the French could neuer yet
be brought to acknowledge, that the Crowne of
Fraunce depended from the holy Sea, or that the
Pope might giue it too, or take it from whom hee
thought fit, and neuer approued the Canon <hi>Alius,</hi>

followeth, that the Pope in pronouncing this decree,
hath spoken nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>I will adde hereunto yet one point more touching
the Doctrine of the Iesuites, which may giue vs a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
taste of their humour. At <hi>Garnets</hi> arraignement
among other matters which he confessed, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that <hi>Catesby</hi> the ring-leader in the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
was touched with remorse of conscience, because
that the time drawing neere for the acting of the plot,
hee considered that in blowing vp the Parliament
house, he must needes together with the Heretiques
make away many innocent Catholiques; now to be
resolued of this scruple, hee addresseth himselfe to
<hi>Garnet,</hi> and demaunds of him whether in doing to
death the bad, a man might with a safe conscience
make away the good also that were found among
them: <hi>Garnet</hi> to this question thus replies, that hee
should make no doubt but that he might iustly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therboth
the one and the other, prouided alwaies
that it aduanced the good of the Catholique Church.
Is it possible to finde a more desperate rage then this,
which to kill Kings spareth not the dearest bloud both
of brothers and friends? And this I report not onely
from the testimonie of <hi>Garnets</hi> arraignement, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:24020:18"/>
from the Confession of those Iesuites, who since his
death haue written discourses in his commendation:

the said Court, and out of the interrogatories of the
conuicted, which are yet kept in the Office of the same
Court, namely:</p>
               <p>That in the yeare 1594. the 27. of December, <hi>Iohn
Chastel,</hi> Clarke, brought vp in the Colledge of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24020:20"/>
Iesuites, hauing giuen the late King a stab with a knife
in the mouth, thinking to haue giuen it in the breast,
was taken and committed to the Prouost of the Kings
house, and brought into the Bishops prison, where vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an interrogatorie, he confessed, that <hi>long agoe hee
had purposed in himselfe to giue this stab, and missing of
his purpose, he would doe it yet if he could, being perswa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ded
that it would be for the good of the Catholique, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique,
and Romane Religion.</hi> Being brought from
thence to the prison of the Palace, hee was examined
by the chiefe Officers of the Court, to whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
amongst other things, <hi>that whereas he had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
that hee should be forgotten of God, and was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
perswaded, he should be damned like Antichrist, of
two euils he made choise to auoid the worst, and being a
damned person, hee had rather his damnation should be
in a fourth degree then in an eight.</hi> Being demanded
where he had learned this new Diuinitie, he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
<hi>that it was by Philosophie.</hi> Being asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had studied Diuinitie in the Colledge of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
he answered: <hi>Yea, and that vnder Father</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
<hi>with whom he had continued two yeares and a halfe.</hi>
Being (further) asked whether hee had euer beene in
the <hi>Chamber of Meditations,</hi> whether the Iesuites vse
to bring the greatest sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there to behold the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of many Diuels, diuersly and fearefully
shaped (vnder colour of reducing them to a better
life,) thereby to cause a perturbation in their spirits,
and consequently vpon such or such resolutions to
push them forwards to the vndertaking of some
great action. His answere was, that <hi>he had often been
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:24020:21"/>
in this chamber of meditations.</hi> Being demaunded
whether the killing of the King were not matter of
ordinarie discourse amongst those Iesuites, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
that hee had heard them say, <hi>It was lawfull to
kill the King, and that he was no member of the Church,
neither ought wee to obey him, nor hold him for (our)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
King, vntill hee had (receiued) approbation from the
Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the foresaid proceedings, certaine of the
Lords of the Court, came to the Colledge of Clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
where the Iesuites were, and (there) seazed on
the papers of <hi>Iohn Guignard,</hi> amongst which there
was found a Booke composed in the praise of <hi>Iames
Clement,</hi> who murthered <hi>Henry</hi> the third, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to doe the like vnto hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Successour: out of
which Booke diuers clauses haue beene produced in
the first Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Court vpon the sight of these Writings, sent
for <hi>Guignard</hi> the Author, who when his Writings
were shewed him, and himselfe examined thereupon,
confessed that himselfe had composed them, and
written them with his owne hand. And hereupon
<hi>Guignard</hi> by sentence of the Court, was (condemned
and) executed the 7. of the Ianuary, 1595.</p>
               <p>By another sentence was <hi>Peter Gueret</hi> Iesuite, the
Maister of <hi>Iohn Chastell</hi> condemned to perpetuall ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and all his goods seazed on, and confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto the King, with commandement for the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Pyramis before the great gate of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
with an inscription containing the causes why
the Iesuites were banished. In which (inscription)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:24020:21"/>
they are tearmed <hi>Heretiques, troublers of the State,
and corrupters of Youth.</hi> Which Pyramis while it
stood, if any did aske why it was set vp, many more
now a dayes are ready to aske why it was puld down.</p>
               <p>A case like vnto this fell out at Melun, the last of
Aprill. 1593. what time the processe criminall was
made against <hi>Peter Barriere,</hi> who being apprehended
vpon the intelligence of a Fryer, an honest man and
faithfull vnto the King, confessed that he came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
vnto the Court to make away the King, and
that he had been incited hereunto by one <hi>Varad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> by
name, a Iesuite, whose daily practise was to defame
the King with vile speeches. By the perswasion of
this Iesuite, the fore-said <hi>Barriere</hi> had prepared a knife
to doe the fear. About this he first of all asked the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bry,</hi> Curate of S. <hi>Andrew des arts,</hi> to whom
he made his purpose knowne, and afterwards betooke
himselfe vnto <hi>Varade,</hi> Rectour of the Colledge of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
vpon the fore-said <hi>Aubry</hi> his aduise. That the
said <hi>Varade</hi> confirmed him in his resolution to kill the
King, and that by assuring him, that in case hee were
apprehended and put to death, hee should obtaine in
heauen a Crowne of Martyrdome. That the said <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi>
adiured him vnto this action, vpon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Confession, and of Communion of the body
of our Lord.</p>
               <p>It was also obserued, that when the late King was
striken, their Colledges being enuironed with a Guard,
certaine Iesuits cried out at the doores of their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
<hi>Surge frater, agitur de Religione: Vp brother, vp,
our Religion is in danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:24020:22"/>Besides this, in the Colledge of the said Iesuites,
there were found diuers theames giuen by the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of formes, the argument of all which was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
<hi>to set vpon Tyrants, and to suffer death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was also certified to betrue, that after Paris was
reduced vnder the Kings obedience, the Maisters of
the Colledge of Iesuites, forbad their Schollers to
pray for the King.</p>
               <p>Else-where informations haue beene made against
<hi>Alexander Hayes,</hi> Iesuite, borne in Scotland, who
taught openly that it was good to dissemble, and for
a while to performe obedience vnto the King in shew.
He was wont to say, <hi>Iesuita est omnis homo.</hi> This Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
was further charged to haue said, and that often,
that he wished if the King came along by their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
he might fall out of the window vpon him, and
breake his neck. For which cause by the sentence of
the Court, giuen the 10. of Ianuarie, 1595. the saide
<hi>Hayes</hi> was condemned to perpetuall banishment; and
withall hee was wished to keepe himselfe out of the
Country, vpon paine of being hanged, without any
other forme of arraignement. Moreouer, the said Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue beene often conuicted for corrupting chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that so they might sende them into strange
Countries against the will of their Fathers. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in the yeare 1595. the 10. of Aprill, a Iesuite, by
name <hi>Iohn the Fayre,</hi> of the Colledge of Cleremont,
did honourable pennance in the great Chamber, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Audience, bare-head and bare-foote in a
white sheete, holding in his hand a burning Torch of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:24020:22"/>
two pound weight of waxe, and sentenced to professe
and declare vpon his knees, that rashly and vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
hee practised to seduce <hi>Francis Veron,</hi> Clarke,
Student in the Vniuersitie of Poictiers, to send him
fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th of the kingdome. And further, that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly
reserued and kept with him Lectures and
Treatises made by some of the said Societie, which
hee receiued and wrote out with his owne hand in the
said Colledge of Cleremont, containing many dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
instructions to attempt against Princes, and
(withall) approbation and commendation of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
parricide, committed vpon the person of our
King of most blessed memorie, <hi>Henry</hi> the third. These
are things so common and so well knowne, that who
so should faine ought, or adde vnto it, cannot haue
any hope to belieued; and he must needes be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
impudent that should denie them, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the Court being witnesses of the truth of them.
Besides all this, there is no man that hath not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
found, that the Iesuites were neuer other
then sworne enemies vnto our Kings. For during
these last troubles, which endeuoured to transport
France into Spaine, there were many of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons found, and that of all Orders, to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
taken the Kings part, but there was no one Iesuite
found to be for him, vntil such time as for their crimes
they were driuen out of the kingdome.</p>
               <p>In a word, the late King our Prince, who neuer was
afraide in warre, (yet) was afraide of these men in
peace. My Lord the Duke of Sully can testifie this,
who perswading the King not to recall the Iesuites,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:24020:23"/>
was answered by him, <hi>Giue mee then securitie for my
life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we step forth of the kingdome of France, we
shall finde many examples of the like. In all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
against <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the late Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
it was alwayes found that some Iesuites or other
had the tempering of them: and yet for all this they
cease not to martyr her with wrongfull speeches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her death, prouoked hereunto by this, that shee
suffered them not to murther her. <hi>Bonars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but that they ought not to reueale it. It was
found also that they had communication (hereon) by

liued at <hi>Bruxels:</hi> this Iesuite was taken since as hee

not but that if he were but a little stretcht by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
a man might learne strange misteries of him;
yea, &amp; that he had some intelligence (to) with <hi>Francis
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:24020:23"/>
Rauillac,</hi> who had been in Flanders somewhat before
his cursed enterprise.</p>
               <p>And if you passe into Polonie, you shall finde that
the Iesuites doe absolutely possesse the King, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
as it were the Tutorship of him, haue carried
him vnto such violent courses, that the Country by
their meanes is risen vp against him, and he in great
hazard of his kingdome. Their factio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s humour is
the cause that Sueden is lost from the Crowne of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and from the Catholique Church. For they
haue moued the King of Poland, to make warre vpon
Duke <hi>Charles</hi> (who now stiles himselfe King) so by
force to compell him to receiue the Iesuites.</p>
               <p>Neither is Transyluania free. Wee haue seene the
Letters of the Baron of Zerotin, dated the 2. of May
last, wherein hee declareth how a Lord of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
hauing a Iesuite (with him) in his house, was by
the same Iesuite drawne to conspire the death of the
Prince of Tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yluania; who being aduertised of the
day (appointed) for the enterprise, went forth of the
Towne that day, giuing out that he went to hunt, and
laid an ambush without the Towne, wherein hee sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
the enterprisers, who followed after him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
their intendment vpon him. He put them all to
death, and the said Iesuite was executed with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
slaughter of his complices.</p>
               <p>The house of Austria alone hath this priuiledge,
(as) to be free from the conspiracies of this Societie.
Of this family the Princes liues are sacred and inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
vnto the Iesuits: for the founder of their Order,
and the General of their Societie being a Spaniard, to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:24020:24"/>
whom they haue vowed a blinde obedience vnder
oath, it is not to be feared in this respect, that euer
they should be moued to enterprise ought against the
Kings of Spaine, or against such as are of his house.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is not without cause, that the
Common-wealth of Venice, (whose wisedome of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
is to be admired) hath driuen them out of
Venice, and out of all their dominions: They (well)
perceiue that these men are creatures of bloud, and
fire-brands of warre, whom they can better endure
without, then within their Country. For their last
troubles had their beginning from the Iesuites: for
whereas the Senate had discouered, that the Iesuites
by cunning fetches had gotten great store of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
by Will, and made themselues Lords of much
land, to the preiudice of the Common-wealth: It was
concluded by aduise in Councell, to prohibite all
Clergie men thence forward to receiue any goods
immoueable by testament, without leaue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
whereunto when other of the Church
submitted, the Iesuites who opposed it, and wrought
against it at Rome, were for euer banished the State.</p>
               <p>And for these considerations it is, that the Citie of
Orleans would neuer receiue them, albeit they haue
much desired it and laboured it. They sent thither one
of their companie to preach their Lent Sermons; but
the Inhabitants were not very well satisfied: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of studying, he busied his braines in searching
out and entertaining such as had yet in their hearts
any (remainder of the) olde leauen of the League: by
whose entercourse this Iesuite set the report going,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:24020:24"/>
that the Kings pleasure was, they should be established
there. Heretofore their talke was of driuing out the
Monkes of S. <hi>Sampson,</hi> that they might get their
Church, and of displacing <hi>Mounsieur,</hi> the Marshall of
Chastres, Gouernour of that Citie, to get his house,
making reckoning to ioyne it together with the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the way vnto the fore-said Church. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all these preparatiues, hauing giuen the King to
vnderstand, that the Citizens of Orleans did excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
desire their company, they did so importune
his Maiestie, that hee granted them to haue an house
there, yet with this charge that the Citizens should
be drawne to consent vnto it. Now when they were
solemnly assembled together about this matter, one
amongst them, <hi>Touruille</hi> by name, a famous Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of the Citie, a man of learning and iudgement,
declared vnto them the inconueniences that might
befall the Citie if they did admit them, and by strong
reasons made it good, that <hi>in France for a man to loue
his King and the Iesuites, were things that could not
stand together.</hi> The chiefe Officers of Iustice following
this first tune, and all the Citizens concurring iointly
in the same opinion, it was concluded, that they should
not be receiued. This Citie at other times hath drunk
of the cup of Rebellion, with many others, but sithens
their reducing vnder obedience vnto the King, they
haue at all times declared themselues most faithfull;
euen by their carriage in this last common affliction,
as they haue declared more griefe then any other, so
do they make the continuance of their obedience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by al maner of good works, more then any other.</p>

               <p>Two yeares after this, so it fell that Mounsieur <hi>de le
Forze,</hi> Lieutenant for the King in Bearne, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences
which hee had from Spaine, by reason of
his neighbour-hood vnto it, was aduertised that a
Spaniard of such a stature, of such an hayre, and in
such apparrell, departed such a day from Barcelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
to go into France, with intendment to make away
the King, by poyson or other meanes. Well, this Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
came to Paris, addressed himselfe to Father
<hi>Cotton,</hi> who brought him vnto the King, &amp; gaue high
commendations of him. A while after came the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Monsieur <hi>de la Forze:</hi> when the King had read
them, hee sends (forth) to seeke Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> and
shewes him the Letters of Mounsieur <hi>de la Forze,</hi> and
commands him to bring backe againe that same
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:24020:26"/>
Spaniard. Father <hi>Cotton</hi> answeres, he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
it, and that the aduertisement was false: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
he would go seeke out the said Spaniard, and
bring him before his Maiestie. Whereupon he goes
forth, and returning a good while after, hee tels the
King, he could not finde him, and that hee was gone.
To see clearely vnto the bottome of this, but a little
good sight is too much.</p>
               <p>It is not aboue a yeare agoe that Father <hi>Cotton</hi>
wrote vnto a prouincial of Spaine diuers things which
our King had vttered in secret, and reuealed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and such as turned to the disgrace of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.
The discouery whereof was the cause why hee
continued in disgrace for the space of sixe Moneths.
Neuerthelesse the late King (through a clemencie
(that was) fatall vnto his owne destruction) forgaue
him, and receiued him into fauour. But it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
how not many daies after, our young King
being importuned by him, gaue him a gird, by such
an answere as he well deserued, in these tearmes; <hi>I
will tell you nothing, for you will writo in into Spaine, as
you haue done the confession of my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to come neere the fact of <hi>Rauillac:</hi> like as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, a man might heare
the Iesuites preach sediciously, and exhort their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
to do the like vnto his Successor: and amongst
others, Father <hi>Commolet,</hi> crying out in his Sermons,
<hi>We haue need of an</hi> Ehud, <hi>be he a Monke, or be he a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour,
we haue need of an</hi> Ehud. Right so at Lent last,
might a man haue heard a Iesuite, by name Father
<hi>Hardy,</hi> Son to one <hi>Mercier,</hi> dwelling on Nostre-Dame
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:24020:26"/>
bridge, preaching at S. Seuerins, and saying, <hi>that
Kings heaped vp treasures to make themselues feared,
but that there needed but a mattocke to kill a King.</hi> In
witnesse whereof, I can produce Mounsier <hi>le Grand,</hi>
and Mounsier <hi>de la Vau,</hi> Counsailours of the Court,
who were present thereat, besides diuers others.</p>
               <p>At the same time Father <hi>Gontier</hi> preached so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously,
and so iniuriously against the King, that
Mounsier the late Marshall of Ornano, as zealously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
vnto the Catholique religion, as any man in
France, being asked of his Maiestie what hee thought
of his Sermons; made answere to him, that if <hi>Gontier</hi>
had spoken as much at Burdeaux, he would haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to be throwne into the Riuer. Euery one from
that time might prognosticate some great mischiefe,
and the murmure was so great amongst true French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that my selfe falling on a time amongst good
company, where some speach past between vs, one
of them affirmed, that a iolly man of qualitie, called

                  <hi>Gontier</hi> (s face,) that
whiles (during these warres) he remained prisone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at
Perigeus, the said <hi>Gontier</hi> in presence of Father <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore,</hi>
Rector of the Colledge, did maintaine against
the said <hi>de la Grange,</hi> that <hi>it were a good deed to kill the
King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this is not all: for to giue fire to the match at
both ends, the Iesuites by meanes of a person named
<hi>Guron,</hi> (who makes shew of much deuotion) would
faine haue prescribed vnto the Curates of the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
in Paris, a forme of preaching the very last Lent,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:24020:27"/>
giuing them in writing sundry discourses tending
to sedition. But diuers honest Curates came to the
Duke of Sully, beseeching him, that by his meanes
they might speake with the King; to whom they
made their complaints, saying; there were some that
would prescribe them to preach things contrarie to
their allegiance. The excessiue clemencie of this great
King contented it selfe with making remonstrance
hereof vnto Father <hi>Gontier;</hi> yea, and to winne
his heart, he made him his Preacher, and gaue him a
pension.</p>
               <p>Like as before lightning a man shall heare some
grumbling in the Clouds: euen so, these preachings
and seditious meetings were the forerunners of this
great blow, that hath shaken this State in the person
of so great a King, whose losse we lament now, but
shall feele it much more in the time to come.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto the Confession of <hi>Rauillac,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This is to be found in the Records.</note> who iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
vnto Father <hi>Aubigny,</hi> that hee had told him in
confession, that he had ben sent to giue a great stroke,
and that hee shewed him the knife, hauing an heart
grauen vpon it. But the said Iesuite protested, that
God had giuen him this grace, that so soone as ought
was reuealed vnto him in confession, hee forgat it
incontinently. The Gallant saued his life by this: but
had he beene in another Countrey, hee would haue
beene taught the Art of Memorie.</p>
               <p>They that haue sounded this <hi>Rauillac,</hi> and haue
beene present at his examination, may perceiue that
the said parricide hath beene (very) throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in this matter: for in euery other point of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:24020:27"/>
Diuinitie hee shewed himselfe most ignorant; but
in the question, whether it be lawfull to kill a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
he was well skilled in all manner of euasions and
Iesuiticall distinctions, as my Lords the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
can testifie, the Sieur <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> Doctor of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and others, who had the examination of this
<hi>Rauillac</hi> in this matter. And this parricide being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what moued him to this attempt, told them
more then once, <hi>What the causes were why it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to kill the King, they might vnderstand by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the Preachers.</hi> His meaning was, that he was
induced hereunto be the sermons before mentioned.
But (more then this) it was easie to perceiue that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
publike exhortations, he had (withall) receiued
particular instructions at large, so well seene was hee
in this argument.</p>
               <p>Neyther is it a circumstance to be neglected, that
Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> hauing obtained leaue to speake with
<hi>Rauillac</hi> in prison, amongest other things that he spake
vnto him, this was one; <hi>Looke well to it, that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
not the Innocent:</hi> fearing (belike) least hee should
accuse the Iesuites: but the Cordeliers, Carmelites,
and other honest religious persons, who were not
touched in conscience, they feared not lest any should
accuse them.</p>
               <p>But whence was it, that at Bruxelles and at
Prage where the Iesuites dominiere, the Kings death
was spoken of (some) twelue, or fifteene dayes before
it came to passe? At Roan diuers receiued letters
from their friends at Bruxelles, desiring to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
whether the report that went of the Kings death
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:24020:28"/>

was aduertised that a Iesuite had giuen it forth, that
the King was dead before it fell out to be so, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
had tolde them, that after his decease Monsieur
the Dolphin should not be King, but the King of
Spaine, and that for the same reasons which Father
<hi>Gontier</hi> gaue in his sermons at Aduent and Lent last.</p>
               <p>I may not omit the prediction of the prouost of
Petiuiers, (who was found strangled in prison) who
being at Petiuiers, two days iourney from Paris, and
playing at nine pinnes, amongst sundry of his friends,
told them saying; <hi>This day the King is either slaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or

religious persons assist the funerals of the King, and

who alone hauing receiued more good turnes of this

keepe his purpose from taking effect, and to thwart
such courses as he iudged to be for the good of the

Cleues, for aide to the princes of Germanie. Since
that, Mounsieur the Marshall of Castres, Generall of
these forces, prepared himselfe for the iourney, when
behold two Iesuites who came to seeke him out, tolde
him that he could not goe this voyage, not bring suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour

fought to affright his conscience with threats, as that
if he did this, hee could not be saued. But the said

               <p>Againe the authoritie of so many Iesuites condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

vaine: for all such passages of the Iesuites are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of Kings whom the Pope and Iesuites acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for Kings: But wee haue made it cleere in the
former Chapters by the authoritie of a great many
Iesuites, and by their actions, that when the Iesuites
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:24020:29"/>
do attempt vpon the life of any King, they make good
their action by this, that such a one they doe not
reckon to be a King, albeit he beares the name, in as

               <p>And therefore the reuerend Abbot of Boyse, hath

whereas <hi>Gregorie</hi> of Valence, Iesuite, saith; It is no way
permitted for a man to attempt vpon the life of his
Prince, albeit he abuse his authority; yet he addes, <hi>If
it be not done by publique iudgement.</hi> Now all the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
maintaine that the iudgement of the Generall

they must rest (themselues,) as on the voyce of Christ,
as wee haue shewed before; wee hold also the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  </gap> of the
Iesuites, affirmes that Iesuites doe no way approue the
murthering of Kings, notwithstanding they loue the
euent: so that it serues to no purpose for Father <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to condemne him that murthered the King, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
he be glad for the euent, that is to say, for
the death of the King.</p>
               <p>And in very deede, it is a fraudulent protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that hee makes of approuing the decree of the

Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> where they condemne the
proposition of <hi>Iohn Petit,</hi> and declare that it is not
lawfull for a subiect to kill a Tyrant: for the Iesuites
haue their euasion ready, and which is a truth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> speaketh of such
Tyrants as are lawfull Kings, and that they speake not
of Tyrants deposed by publike iudgement, and whose
Subiects are discharged and absolued of their oath
of allegiance by the Pope, nor of Kings who are
iudged enemies vnto the Church. For if the Iesuites
shall vndertake to make away a King, they will easily
finde (out) some reason (or other) to proue that he is
no King at all, and by consequence that (herein) they
doe nothing against the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> nor
against those places which Father <hi>Cotton</hi> alledged out
of the writings of the Iesuites.</p>
               <p>That which Father <hi>Cotton</hi> addes, that this was the
singular opinion of <hi>Mariana,</hi> and not of all their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
hath beene disproued in the first Chapter, by the
approbation of a great many Iesuites, whose names
are in the front of <hi>Marianaes</hi> Booke, and by the bookes
of sundry Iesuites, who affirme the same that <hi>Mariana</hi>
doth; yea, they commend him, and maintaine him:
and the Iesuite <hi>Cotton</hi> (himselfe) doth so tenderly
condemne him, that in his reprehensions of him, hee
doth rather seeme to flatter him.</p>
               <p>As for that pretended decision, which hee would
make vs belieue to haue beene made in a prouinciall
congregation of the Iesuites, wherein <hi>Mariana</hi> was
condemned by them: this seemes to mee, to marre
their Market, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

feare to make French-men too well affected towards
the preseruation of the King? or did they feare to giue
offence to the Iesuites of Spaine, by publishing their
condemnation of <hi>Mariana?</hi> Out of doubt it will be
found that either any such decision was neuer made,
or if it were, it was a matter of (mere) Equiuocation,
and ambiguous (construction)</p>
               <p>And this will be more easily belieued when a man

and whether the Subiects are bound, neuerthelesse to

excommunication.</p>
               <p>IIII. Whether in case some good Catholique
shall discouer vnto a Iesuite in Confession his purpose
to kill the King, the Iesuite ought to reueale this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,

Kings head, albeit he be without blame.</p>
               <p>VI. Whether Kings are aboue Clarkes: that is to
say, whether the King hath authoritie ouer their
goods, and ouer their liues, as much as ouer his other
Subiects.</p>

               <p>These are the points, whereon all honest Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
desire the Iesuites might be catechised, and that
it would please the <hi>Queene Regent,</hi> and my Lords the
Princes of the bloud, the Officers of the Crowne, and
Lords of the Counsaile, to commaund Father <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and his companions to write their mindes cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to set forth their Confession, to the end these
new impressions which enfeeble the authoritie of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:24020:31"/>
our Kings, and hazard their liues, might be razed
out of (the mindes of) the people, in stead of giuing
vs articles which touch not the matter, and which
(withall) are carried in obscure and doubtfull termes,
like vnto the sword of <hi>Delphos,</hi> which cuts on both
sides.</p>
               <p>The first Article is this: <hi>All Iesuites</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in
generall and in particular, are ready to seale euen with
their owne bloud, that they haue not either in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or other, any other Faith, doctrine and opinion,
then that of the Church of Rome.</hi> Herein he speakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his conscience: for if all Iesuites in particular
are agreed in euery thing, it followes that <hi>Cotton</hi> and
<hi>Mariana</hi> doe agree together, and that <hi>Cotton</hi> doth not
well to condemne him. Whereas he saith, that all the
Iesuites are ready to subscribe, that in this matter they
haue no other beliefe then the vniuersall Church
hath. I answere, that the Iesuites may easily subscribe
to any thing that a man would haue them, sith they
haue their retention, and secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> conditions, which
they reserue in their mindes: but I am well assured
that the vniuersall Church will not subscribe to any of
those abhominable positions of the Iesuites, which
we haue formerly alledged out of their Bookes, much
lesse will it approue their actions.</p>
               <p>His second Article is: <hi>That amongst all kindes of
gouernments and administrations of Common-wealths a
Monarchie is the best.</hi> To what purpose is this? It is not
necessarie that they who esteeme a Monarchie to be
better then a Democratie, for this cause, must make
scruple to destroy Kings: or that they who desire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:24020:32"/>
to kill the King, must haue an intention to change the
forme of Gouernment; but only they desire another
King, because he that liues mislikes them.</p>
               <p>The third Article sauours altogether of the Iesuites
veyne, and of their termes, for therein is nothing but
Equiuocations, and mentall reseruations. It saith,
<hi>That such as is the spirituall Gouernment of the Church,
which relyes on the Vicar of Iesus Christ, the Succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssour
of S.</hi> Peter: <hi>such is the temporall of the State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Fraunce, that it determines in the person of the
King, our Soueraigne Lord and Maister.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
spoken to the full in this, but with much dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation:
for hee dares not affirme that the King is
as simply absolute in his Kingdome, as the Pope in
the Church: for the Iesuites alone maintaine that the
Pope can depose Kings; but they do not maintain that
Kings may depose Popes: they hold that Popes can
discharge Subiects of their obedience vnto Kings; but
they do not hold that Kings can dispense with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
touching their obedience vnto Popes: They hold
that the Popes power reacheth vnto the temporalties
of Kings, either directly as some say, or indirectly as
others say; but they doe not belieue that Kings haue
any power either directly or indirectly, ouer the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualties
or temporalties of Popes: they hold that there
are many persons in Fraunce who are not lyable to
tryall before the Kings Iudges; but they do not hold,
there is any man within th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> territories of S. <hi>Peter</hi> who
is not triable before the Officers of his holinesse: they
hold that the Pope can leuie money and rents vpon
the Ecclesiasticall reuenewes of the Kingdome of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:24020:32"/>
Fraunce; but they doe not holde that the Kings of
Fraunce can leuie any mony vpon the persons nor vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the lands of Italy, which are of the Patrimonie
of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is not credible that Father <hi>Cotton</hi> will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himselfe against Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Iesuite,
all the Iesuites now adayes being his Disciples and
Schollers, who in his fift Booke, <hi>De Pontifice Romano,</hi>
and sixt Chapter, writes thus: <hi>The Pope may change
kingdomes, take them from one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bestow them on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the supreme Prince spirituall, and when he shall
finde it necessarie for the saluation of soules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Of whom
also we haue formerly learned that Kings are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
Clarks. The same (Authour) in the second
Chapter of his Booke, <hi>Of the exemption of the Clergie,</hi>
cals all Kings and Princes ingenerall, <hi>Prophane men:</hi>
And he holds in diuers places,<note place="margin">Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Princes, is but an humane institution, and is onely the
worke of men.</hi> Albeit the Apostle in the thirteenth
to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> saith; <hi>That there is no power but of
God, and the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi>
And therefore it is no part of the Iesuites beliefe, to
account Kings to be Kings in such sort, as the Pope is
the head of the Church, seeing they are not Kings but
by humane institution: but the Pope is head of the
Vniuersall Church by the institution of God. In a
word, <hi>Cotton</hi> speakes but with halfe a mouth, and by
that which hee saith, it is impossible to apprehend
what he beleeueth. And the same may be said of his
other Articles.</p>
               <p>The last Article is a recrimination of those of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:24020:33"/>
pretended reformed Religion, sundry of whose Books
he saith are infected with this opinion, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for a Subiect to make away his King. After this he
addes; <hi>I could note and specifie the places, alledge their
words, were it not much better that they should remaine
swallowed vp of the gulfe of forgetfulnesse.</hi> Oh what
matter of triumph here doth he giue vnto our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries?
whose saying will be, that if Father <hi>Cotton</hi> had
knowne those places, hee would not haue failed to
bring them to light, and it had beene good to name
the bookes, that they might be suppressed, and the
Authors punished if they were liuing.</p>
               <p>Now hereupon I haue been moued in the humor
of curiosity to cleare my selfe: and enquiring of some
of the contrary Religion, men not vnlearned, they
haue answered mee, that indeede the Councell of

slandereth <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> not onely in this point, but also in
diuers others: that this is no where to bee found

much as any one word is to be found of aduise to kill
Kings, nor so much as any one precept of rebellion.
That <hi>Luther</hi> writ indeed against King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight
of England, in most contemptuous sort and indiscreet
termes: but that <hi>Luther</hi> was none of his Subiect, and
that he neuer spake of killing Kings, nor of rebelling

yet neuerthelesse a little after (all this,) these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be established againe, and to possesse the heart
of the King, whose mouth they had slit: So is it a
thing as much to be wondred at, to see at this day,
after so horrible a death, those, who haue set abroach
the doctrine of murthering (Princes) and who are
knowne to haue a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inger in the action, to continue
still, and to be neare about the person of the King.</p>
               <p>I will beleeue that the person of Father <hi>Cotton</hi> is
free from this crime, and that Father <hi>Gontier</hi> and
<hi>Aubigny</hi> had no communication with him, and that
he had no intelligence with the Iesuites of Bruxelles:
yet such are his maners and his profession, that it is
no way fit, nor for (the) credit (of the Court) for him
to come neere about the person of his Maiestie.</p>
               <p>First of all, I affirme that <hi>Cotton,</hi> who cals himselfe
a religious person, yea, of such a Company who take
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:24020:34"/>
vnto them the name of Iesus, is a scandall to the
whole Church, being euery day a follower of the
Court: for this is a thing contrary, not onely to the
Institution of all Monkes, but particularly to the rules
of the Iesuites, as Father <hi>Richeome</hi> assureth vs in his
Apologeticall complaint: and Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi> the
Iesuite, in his Booke <hi>Of the Institution of Priests.</hi> 1.
Booke, and 40. Chapter, holds it for a generall truth,
that <hi>a religious person who betakes himselfe vnto the
Courts of Princes, is an excommunicate person, albeit
he hath leaue of his Superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the imprinting of vertue in the heart
of a Prince, it is fit to set about his person men that
are enemies vnto vices, and such as will not flatter him
in his imperfections. This was one of the (great) faults
of Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> euen his conniuence at the pleasures
of the late King, in stead of with-drawing him from
them. And such a Prince was hee, that if a man an
enemie vnto vice, had helde his place about him,
it had beene an easie matter to restraine him. This is
the complaint that Father <hi>Portugais,</hi> lately made in
our hearing, in a funerall Sermon that he preached at
S. <hi>Iames</hi> in the Shambles, and which afterwards he set
forth in print.</p>
               <p>Yet this is not all: for in stead of restrayning him,
he rather humoured him, affirming euen at a full Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that his Maiestie made amends for his sinnes
with many merits: that <hi>Dauid</hi> committed faults, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he were a man after Gods owne heart.</p>
               <p>(Nay,) he did well worse then this: for he was the

               <p>And for his life; therein he hath discouered egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

he neuer committed any mortall sinne; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,

beares vnto her is such, that he cannot promise himselfe
to haue full ioy in Paradise, if he finde not her there.</hi> This
Damsell was entred amongst the questions which this

               <p>Who doth not wonder at the incredible impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of this man, who insinuates himselfe euery where,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:24020:37"/>
and shrinkes not backe for an hundred puttings by?
who thrusts himselfe into euery action, who makes
himselfe a companion to Princes, who in the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he sets forth, seemes as if hee would flatter God,
and bring him a sleepe with words that sauour of his
Queane? What an heart-burning would it be to see a
caitife Iesuite besiege the spirit of a King, and to be
as a man may say, tyed to his girdle, while in the
meane time, Princes and Lords who haue done him
great seruice, haue much a doe to come neere him?
I cannot conceiue any reason why other of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
who for many ages haue beene the pillars of the
Church of Fraunce, who neuer laide hand on their
Kings, and who neuer abandoned them in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
especially in the (time of our) last troubles,
should not enioy the same fauour that these new come

               <p>And if in seauen or eight yeares, since their reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
they haue bestird themselues so well, that in

places, especially at <hi>la Flesche,</hi> an house, that comes to
aboue an hundred thousand crowns, what wil they do
if they continue but twenty years more? This is a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

they must dominiere to: they haue already built an

and there the Rector of the Vniuersitie shall haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

others to insinuate into mens houses, to please women

may swallow lands, and whole inheritances: whence it
will come to passe, that the Vniuersitie of Paris, shal be
but a shadow, and assuredly come to nothing. From
hence in tenne yeares space, the Priuie Councell, and
Courts of Parliament, and the great Councell, shal be
full of the Disciples of the Iesuites, and the rest of the
Clergie shal no more be made reckoning of: for they
haue a purpose to bring them lower, and they speake

learning. For the restoring whereof, my Lord the said
Cardinall hath a purpose to erect a new Colledge in
the Vniuersitie, where he will raise (the study of good)
letters, which are falne, sith these men haue soyled
them, by reducing them vnto a miserable kinde of
Schollerisme, and making them to consist of slender
obseruations which themselues haue gathered.</p>
               <p>(Yet) this were but a small matter, were it not that
by bringing vp Schollers, and making men learned,
they hereby graspe the State, and goe about to bring
Kings vnder a Tutorship, and stirre vp people vnto
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:24020:38"/>
sedition, and if they were as ready to rise, as these are
busie to solicite them, France by this had runne ouer
with bloud, and the death of the King had beene fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with massacres both of the one and of the other
Religion: for this was their hope in this cursed parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide:
from which if this blow cannot keepe them from
falling, they will easily finde the meanes to renew
their party.</p>
               <p>In the meane while let my Lords of the Councell,
and my Maisters of the Courts of Parliaments, iudge
whether with a good Conscience they can permit the
hearing of confessions vnto them, who haue sworne
to reueale nothing, though it necessarily concerne the
preseruation of the King: and whether it be not fit to
force them from so damnable a doctrine, that makes
them culpable of high treason. To what purpose serues
it to burn a book by the executioner, while the (persons
themselues) are suffered? and to execute a piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
while in the meane time a man dares not name
the Iesuits, for feare to offend them? Let them consider
whether they will be glad to see the ruine of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of Paris, which euer since <hi>Charles</hi> the great,
hath beene the Ornament of this Kingdome: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in suffering the encrease of these, and their esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
in the Court, they can be content to hold
the Kings faithfull Catholiques in defiance, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
to behold yet a third parricide. Let them
be forbidden to entermeddle in affaires of State: let
them preach the Gospell, and the Commandements
of the Church: let Parents be bound to send their
Children vnto Colledges in the Vniuersitie: let there
not be two distinct Vniuersities: let enquirie be made
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:24020:39"/>
what the Iesuites doe with all their wealth, seeing it is
wel knowne they are but few in number, and that they
do not spend it neither vpon apparrell, nor on horses,
nor vpon seruants. To what end then serues all their
reuenewes, saue to make voyages, and Commissions
for strange Countries, and to make a store-house that
may serue to wage the enemies of the State, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the charges of some Rebellion, as they did
in the last league? For I finde the Polander had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when he said that the Societie of the Iesuites was
a sword, whose scabberd was in France, but the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of it in Spaine, or at Rome, where the Generall of
the Iesuites abides; for the first motion to draw this
sword comes from thence.</p>
               <p>This is it we had to say on this matter, whereunto
my desire is, that answere should be made from point
to point: or rather that we would open our eyes vnto
these considerations, which are most cleare and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
And if in doing this we shall procure more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
then we shall gaine commodity, yet this shall be
our comfort, that wee haue not failed in our duty of
proposing things necessarie for the good of the State,
and for the peace and safety of the Church.</p>

who of deuotion destine themselues to death, as
to a Martyrdome pleasing to God, is by vs held to be
a pestilent deuise, neuer seene nor read in the records
of Antiquitie; nor as much as knowne to the ancient
Pagans or Christians. Among the <hi>Mahumetanes</hi> only,
one named, <hi>the old man of Montagne,</hi> is found to haue
vsed this tricke, but the rest of that Sect crushed it in
the egge, and neuer since put it in practice, howbeit
their malice a gainst Christian Princes be no way aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Onely about sixty yeares agoe, this poyson
spread it selfe in the vaines of Christendome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be put in execution in England and in France;
we say in England, in as much as in regard of ciuill

Church, and the examples of Saints, now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
sometime prelates and Bishops of France. Now
this hellish position of theirs is grounded vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:24020:40"/>
erroneous doctrine, which is, the Popes omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie,
whom we acknowledge head of the Church,
in that manner and meaning as our predecessors haue
done. The doctrine of this omnipotencie, is not at all
to be found in the diuinitie of Paris, nor in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of the Vniuersitie, but we find it in the Sermons
and writings of the Iesuits, &amp; in the answeres of assa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at their arraignment before the ludges.</p>
            <p>To put this matter out of doubt, we need no more,
then to heare themselues speaking. <hi>Parrie,</hi> who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
the murthering of the late Queene of England,
maintained that <hi>he might lawfully doe it, she s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

excommunicate by the Pope, and consequently her life
abandoned. Catesby</hi> the vndertaker of the fire-worke,
which should haue blowne vp the King of great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the Queene, their Children, &amp; the States, stood
to it, <hi>that the enterprise was holy: for since</hi> Clement <hi>the
eight by two briefes, forbad the Catholikes to receiue him,
they had better reason (as he thought) to make him away
being receiued. Iohn Chastel</hi> affirmed that <hi>he thought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
a meritorious worke to kill our last King, because that
although the Bishops of Fraunce had receiued him into
the Church, yet he was not in it, the Pope hauing not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him. Rauillac,</hi> the last parricide, affirmed that
<hi>the King vndertooke the last warre against the good will
of the Pope,</hi> that <hi>God was the Pope, and the Pope God,
by vertue of those words; Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and vpon this
rocke, &amp;c.</hi> Hereupon the Bishop of Cleremont, one
of their disciples failed not after the execution of the
murtherer to be present at the assembly of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

which was called (accordingly as our ancestours
had chalked vs out the way,) for the censuring and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:24020:41"/>
condemning of that murthering doctrine, where tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himselfe from company to company, before the
sitting of the Doctors, he told them they should take
heede what they did, for you haue here (saith he) two
of the Popes Nuncioes; and the Company being sate,
he told them, that the question then to be discussed
had beene diuersly handled, and that in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it was needfull they should propose it to the
Popes Nuncioes, who might giue notice of it to the
Pope their Maister; as is none other Kings were to liue
but whom it pleased the Pope.</p>
            <p>After that many good Preachers of this Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
had contested against the murthers of Kings, and
the broachers and abettors of that doctrine, at last Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Cotton</hi> presents your Maiestie with a Letter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratorie,
of the doctrine of the Iesuites in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
in which hee labours to giue contentment to
such as complaine that their writings maintaine these
three doctrines, cousen-germains, the omnipotencie
of the Pope, and from thence depending rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Kings, &amp; abandoning of their liues, when they,
or such as themselues, shall iudge them Tyrants: but
men of vnderstanding sufficiently perceiue the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations
and fallacies wherewithall they would sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
their mischieuous doctrine, following herein the
vse and practise of that position where of their Sect
make open profession in treatises expresly allowed
by the Generall of their Order; as may be seene in
the Apologie made in the behalfe of <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> in
the Chapter of Equiuocations: yet should wee be
loath to discouer them, and to hinder their counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite
coine from being currant for some profit which might
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:24020:41"/>
might from thence arise; were it not that by the
vertue of these ambiguities, that Sect hopes to get
the start of vs in opening their Schooles in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of Paris, against the setled and resolued de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the last King. In regard whereof this
Vniuersitie, daughter of the French Kings, should
hold her selfe guiltie of disloyaltie if she did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske
those fallacies, and become an humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
to your Maiestie to prouide that this daughter
(most faithfull to her Liege as long as shee is kept

of that sect which hath long since beene found to be

may it please your Maiestie to be informed, that this

stood for: namely, to affirme that the Pope hath

Monarchiall power in the Church: for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
contradictorie speaches, to maintaine, that a

if euer it were necessarie, surely now a dayes it is

is meerly opposite to the doctrine of our Lord Iesus

Christ, who hath for euer put a separation betweene
the Church and the State, in those words, <hi>Giue vnto

<hi>and vnto</hi> Caesar, <hi>that which belongs vnto</hi> Caesar,
that is, ciuill obedience, honour, homage, and tribute.</p>
            <p>May it please your Maiestie: your Vniuersitie of
Paris hath neuer taught otherwise, holding her selfe
fastto the ancient councels, and reiecting the new, in
that wherein they reiect this wholesome doctrine, and
this is it in which the Kings, the Bishops of Fraunce,
the Courts of Parliament, the Kings councell, the
French Doctors, &amp; lastly, this your Vniuersitie, haue
alwaies held the liberties of the French Church and
kingdome to consist. And surely, it is no final question
which we haue now in hand, no lesse worth then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the King, which these men leaue to the mercy
of the Pope, these men I say, to whose charge the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vp of our youth is euery where committed, the
consciences of the people in their confessions, and by
their sermons and writings the instruction of all. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that in the meane while the life of the
King, &amp; that of your Maiesty are in hazard, in as much
as when the pope withdraws the right of gouernment
from a Prince, they hold him presently for a tyrant, as
vsurping against the determination of that publike
authoritie, which according to the Iesuites doctrine,
may of a King make a tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nay, they farther affirme
that Subiects may rebell against their Soueraigne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be not excommunicate, if they beleeue,
that those who should do it, fearing his greatnes, durst
not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the decision of the Iesuite <hi>Suarez,</hi> who by
that means sets the estates &amp; liues of al potent Princes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:24020:43"/>
to sixe and seauen. Such is also the practise of some
murtherers of Kings, men who acknowledge the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie
of the Pope, taught by the Iesuites, and
indeed acknowledge none other, but so far forth as it
pleaseth the Pope; and this was apparantly the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of that last wretched parricide, as it was cleere
by that execrable discourse which he held with those
diuines, who were sent to confer with him; vnto whom
he shewed him selfe to haue beene perfectly skilled, in
all the shifts and cauils which Sophistrie it selfe could
possibly inuent, touching that subiect: this man I say,
was thus cunning in this point, who was otherwise
deuoid of all good literature, and almost common
vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>We make no doubt, but if it would please your
Maiestie to consult the Pope in this point, he would
be drawne to performe that, which hee ought, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
by his Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to hell pit such murtherers and
assassins, and by stopping (which might be done by a
word of his mouth) the torrent of those mischiefes,
which cast a shame and obloquie vpon the innocency
of Christian Religion; for the power which these
men haue hitherto had at Rome, hath giuen occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome to giue out, that since hee labours not to
preuent these mischiefes, acted by them, vpon whom
he may worke what he list, it cannot be auoided but
himselfe must needes be thought to be the author
of them: as the rules of iustice require.</p>
            <p>The pretence which <hi>Cotton</hi> drawes from the good
of the Church, thereby to draw to the Pope power
to dispose of kingdomes, is but a colourable pretext:
for by vertue of that separation, which our Lord <hi>Iesus
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:24020:43"/>
Christ</hi> hath for euer made betweene Religion and the
State, through the whole world, where his Gospell
should be preached, wee stand obliged, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all Ecclesiastique censures, interdictions, dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
for oaths of allegiance, or commandements
whatsoeuer from the Pope, not to take Armes against
our Kings, but contrariwise to yeeld them all ciuill and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> obedience, and for safeguard of their liues
to hazard our owne. This is the law of nature, ingrauen
in the hearts of men, euen when they enter into this
world, which the Sonne of God clothed with our flesh,
hath since established and consecrated, binding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to the obseruance of it in a straiter maner th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
were the Pagans, led by the sole light of Nature; and
Priests more strictly then Laickes, to whom they are
to preach sound doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> Bishop of all, because his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in this case would more preuaile then any other,
nay all the other beside. This was the true cause why
the King of great Britaine, to safeguard himselfe from
these King-killers, was constrained to exact of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
an oath of allegiance, for their ciuill and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
obedience, and the surety of his life, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Popes Buls.</p>
            <p>An oath which the frequent doctrine and practise
of assassines now a dayes makes in a maner necessarie
through Christendome, to secure the estates and liues
of Gods annointed, and withall to free the Catholike
Apostolike Romaine Religion toward the Kings and
Princes of the earth, from that blame &amp; hatred which
this wicked doctrine drawes with it, and to make it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:24020:44"/>
more gracious in the eyes of those who maintaine a
different religion. Yet is this wholsome doctrine more
needfull in France then any where beside, because the
effects of the contrarie fall especially vpon the life and
crowne of the King, and rather now in the minoritie
of our King, then in his full age, this erroneous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ought to beresuted, and the venters thereof pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
because the practise of the ages past hath euer
taught vs, that when they would draw out their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
against the temporalties of Kings, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
set vpon the weakest.</p>
            <p>For these reasons the Vniuersitie of Paris, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Kings of Fraunce, most humbly beseecheth
your Maiestie, the Princes of the blood, and the Lords
of the Councell, not to giue way to the Iesuites (si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
they defend an opinion touching the popes
omnipotencie, and the suretie of the estates and liues
of Kings, quite contrarie to that which this Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

their incorporating into the Vniuersitie, least they
