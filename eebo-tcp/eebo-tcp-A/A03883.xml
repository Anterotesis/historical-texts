            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE FIRST CHAPTER.</hi> Whether the Church be the foundation and ground of our faith? And of the true state of this Question.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the pertinacy of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries were not so great, it were an easy matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of those few wordes of the Apostle, affirming, that the Church is the Pillar and ground of truth: for seing that our faith relyeth vpon truth (that is to say, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the most true word of God) and that<note place="margin">1. ad Tim. 3. v. 15.</note> the Church is the Pillar and ground of this truth, it must needes follow that the Church is the Pillar and ground of our faith, as afterward we will declare more at large. But because our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18739:3"/>
goe about to ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ure this great and renowned prayse of our Church, we will treate of this matter more exactly: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note place="margin">Cap. 13. seq. §. 16.</note> because this is a question of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, seing that theron dependeth our whole faith. For euery thing rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and dependeth of his foundation. Moreouer, heereby is declared the great excellency and authority of the Church. Hence also other opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our faith are to be proued which our Aduersaries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, their errors confuted, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues very easily conuinced: but that the true state of this Controuersie may the better be vnderstood, three thinges are to noted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The first is, that euery science and doctrine hath her grounds &amp; principles, out of which all other thinges are dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, proued, and depende: wherefore we must heere diligently examine and search out the true principles of our faith, least otherwise our faith become doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vncertaine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The second is, that there are two principles of our faith, the one, that God is true, and the Author of truth, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that these thinges which we belieue are spoken and reuealed vnto vs by God. There is lesse difficulty of the former
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18739:3"/>
principle. For all who confesse that there is a God, may easily know euen by natural reason, that he is true, or rather the very Truth it selfe. And seing that he is the chiefest good, he can deceiue no body, and seing that he is Wisdome it selfe, he<note place="margin">Ad Hebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> 6. v. 18.</note> cannot be deceyued. Hereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle taketh this as a principle manifestly knowne by it selfe, It is impossible for God to lye.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the doubts and difficulties which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning matters of faith do especially arise of the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to wit, because we know not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that such things as we belieue, are reuealed by God: for hence ariseth the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy with <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> &amp; <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</hi> For all do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that God is true, but the <hi>Turkes</hi> say that their <hi>Alcora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by God, the <hi>Iewes</hi> their <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> their bible, corrupted &amp; maymed by them; the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> their blasphemies vttered against the Blessed <hi>Trinity;</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> their opinions, the <hi>Caluinists</hi> theirs, and the <hi>Catholikes</hi> theirs. And hence it is that we need greatly <hi>some sure foundation, principle, rule,</hi> and <hi>meanes,</hi> whereby we may know certainly which is the doctrine indeed reuealed by God, and which is not, otherwise our fayth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18739:4"/>
will alwayes remayne doubtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The third is, that God is accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med three wayes to assure his Church of this his reuelation. The first way is, when God himselfe appeareth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen and speaketh to his Church, for so in tymes past he spake vnto all the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he gaue them the tables of<note place="margin">Exod. 20. v. 22.</note> his Law in the mount <hi>Sinay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The second is, when God speaketh to one alone from heauen, and he sendeth him to the Church, that he may reueale vnto the whole Church such things as God hath spoken vnto him. So in tymes past in the old Testament God spake by himselfe to <hi>Moyses,</hi> and <hi>Moyses</hi> reuealed<note place="margin">Exod. 24. v. 2. 3. Ad Gal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. v. 12.</note> the same things to the people. And in the new Testament <hi>Christ</hi> in this manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed his Ghospell to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> which he afterward reuealed vnto others. But these two wayes are extraordinary, and are ceased, as all doco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, excepting only a few <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Swenkeldiani,</hi> whose madnesse and folly all men disproue.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The third way is ordinary, which alwayes remayneth in the Church, and whereof the whole controuersy is. For almost all <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; the <hi>purer sort</hi> of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinists</hi> will haue the sole Scripture to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18739:4"/>
the foundation and rule, wherby we may certainly know the true reuelation of<note place="margin">Calu. l. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inst. cap. 7. sect. 1. &amp; 2.</note> God from the false. But <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe at the first blush seemeth to attribute this to the sole Scripture, and very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliously inueygheth against Catholikes who deny it, whome therefore he calleth brauling and sacrilegious persons: yet a litle after he reduceth the principall<note place="margin">Calu. eod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> c. 7. sect. 4. in fine. &amp; sect. 5.</note> and cheifest certaynty of Scriptures, and of our whole fayth to the particuler and priuate spirit of euery belecuer. The late <hi>Caluinists</hi> do put two grounds and rules of fayth, to wit the Scripture, and this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate spirit: But Catholikes do teach that neyther the Scripture alone is sufficient, nor this priuate spirit togeather with the Scripture: but moreouer the spirit, and authority of the whole &amp; visible Church is necessary. And this is the true state of of this question.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We will therfore explicate foure things, that this whole controuersy may more clearly be defined. <hi>First</hi> what are the <hi>properties</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of the ground of fayth, for by these the ground it selfe will easily be knowne. For euen as by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a man it may be knowen who is a true man, and by the properties of any other thing, the thing it selfe may be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18739:5"/>
knowne. So by the properties of the ground of fayth, the ground it selfe wilbe knowne. <hi>Secondly</hi> it shalbe proued that the Scripture alone is not a sufficient ground or rule of fayth. Thirdly, that neyther any priuate spirit will suffise. Fourthly that the authority of the Catholike Church, is the most true ground and rule of fayth.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The properties of the ground and rule of our fayth are alledged.</head>
            <p>THERE are ten properties of the ground or rule of fayth, and they are so manifest and certayne, that none can doubt thereof. The <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>continuall,</hi> and <hi>neuer interrupted duration</hi> thereof to the end of the world. For euen as fayth and the Church do alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure &amp; continue; so must also the ground of fayth, seing that nothing can consist without his foundation and ground.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>second</hi> propertie is the <hi>most certayne</hi> and <hi>vndoubted truth</hi> thereof, in so much, that it neyther can deceyue any, nor be deceaued in any thing appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18739:5"/>
necessarily to saluation, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it should be vncertaine and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yea also the fayth it selfe should be false and hurtfull vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> propertie is the <hi>certaynty therof on our part.</hi> For it is necessary that the true fayth be not only certayne in it selfe, but also to vs. Because error and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaynty is ingendred in vs, if the thing be ambiguously and obscurely proposed, how certayne soeuer it be in it selfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourth</hi> property is, the <hi>strength</hi> &amp; <hi>immutability</hi> therof, so that this ground can by no meanes be depraued, changed, or corrupted. For otherwise truth will sometyme perish, &amp; there will arise some error against fayth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>fifth</hi> property is the <hi>fullnesse</hi> &amp; <hi>sufficiency</hi> of those things which are to be belieued, that is to say, it must conteine all things appertayning to the Catholike fayth, seeing that nothing can consist without his ground or foundation.</p>
            <p n="6">6, The <hi>sixt</hi> property, is the <hi>necessity</hi> therof, that is to say, it must necessarily be receiued of all, who haue the true fayth, and because without it, true fayth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consist, euen as the building cannot continue without the foundation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>seauenth</hi> property is, that it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18739:6"/>
a <hi>manifest signe and token,</hi> wherby Christians are distinguished from Infidells. For he which wanteth the ground and rule of fayth is an infidell, but he who retayneth it, is a true beleeuer.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>eight</hi> property is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that in euery article and conclusion of fayth, this principle and ground is virtually conteyned,</hi> seeing that out of it all things are to be deduced, &amp; they receiue the certaynty from it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The <hi>ninth</hi> property is, that it not <hi>only moue Christians to belieue, but that it also conuince the infidells.</hi> For otherwise the way to faith and eternall saluation, should not be knowne, or open to <hi>Infidells.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That the Scripture alone is not the ground or rule of fayth.</head>
            <p>THAT the Scripture alone is not the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of our fayth, we haue already declared by the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ground of fayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged. For of those ten properties the Scripture hath o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly one, to wit, Truth; but al the other properties are wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. The which we clearly demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strate in this sort. <hi>First</hi> of all, a perpetuall duration, and continuance is wanting. For the holy Scripture begun first vnder the old law in Moyses tyme, wheras two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares before, there were both true beleeuers and a Church. In like manner in the new law the Apostles began to write some yeares after they had receiued the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the certaynty on our part<note place="margin">Supra co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro. 1. c. 5. &amp; infra hac co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tr. 6. cap. 15.</note> is wanting, seeing that we know not which is the Canonicall Scripture by the Scripture it selfe, but by the authority of the Church, as we haue proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and will also more at large declare
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18739:7"/>
heereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the foresaid strength &amp; immutability is wanting; for euery parte of the holy Scripture considered in it owne nature, is subiect to many alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and falsifications. For it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied,<note place="margin">Supra. Controu. 1. cap. 4.</note> it may be corrupted, it may be wrested to contrary senses, wherof we haue spoken before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, that fulnesse and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is wanting, because all thinges necessary to saluation are not expresly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<note place="margin">Supra Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouers. 1. c. 26. &amp; sequent.</note> in holy Scriptures, as we haue also declared before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fiftly, the foresaid necessity is wanting. For without the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there were in the law of Nature for the space of two thousand yeares many true belieuers. And also long after Christ, yea euen till the tyme of <hi>S. Irenaeus,</hi> that is to say, almost two hundred yeares, there were many Nations who sincerely belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Christ, without any holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,<note place="margin">S. Irenaeus l. 3. cap. 4.</note> as S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himselfe testifieth. Lastly, albeit Infidels should burne all the Bibles, yet the faith of Christians should not therfore perish, or be wholy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne. Therfore our faith doth not necessarily depend of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixtly, the seauenth property is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18739:7"/>
also wanting: for by the holy Scriptures the true Christians are not distinguished from Infidels, because almost all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes do both now receyue the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and in tymes past also receyued them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seauenthly, the eight propertie is wanting, for there are many pointes of faith which rely vpon the Traditions of<note place="margin">Supra Contr. 1. c. 26. &amp; 27.</note> the Church only, without any expresse Scripture at all, as we haue declared before.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eightly, the ninth property is wanting. For Turkes and other Gentills who are only lead by naturall reason, are very seldome or neuer conuerted by Scriptures only: but we add also some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall reasons and perswasions that they may be conuerted. For there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in holy Scriptures which s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>me opposite to naturall reason, as the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes of the <hi>Blessed Trinity, Incarnation, &amp; Resurrection of the dead &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Ninthly, there wanteth last of all the tenth property, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extant of the Scripture in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The holy Scripture indeed is the ground and reason, why we belieue many points of faith, but not the ground
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18739:8"/>
why we belieue all. Moreouer neyther is it the first ground of all that we belieue by it. For the Scripture it self is proued by some other more generall ground, to wit, by the authority of the Church. VVherfore the Scripture is only a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer ground and not a generall: a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and not immediate: a secondary, and not the first, and chiefest rule of faith.</p>

            <p>THAT no priuate spirit of any can be the ground of our Faith, is farre more euident by the same properties now alledged. For none of these ten properties doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the priuate spirit of euery one that belieueth, the which we declare in these arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First there wanteth the foresaid continuance. For there is no priuate or particuler person, who hath continued from the beginning of the world, or shall

            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate only in their opinion haue this spirit, euen as they only in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue the true fayth: but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate are knowen to none but only to God, according to that of the Apostle <hi>God knoweth who are his.</hi> The which <hi>Caluin</hi>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the foresaid strength and immutability is wanting, for that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man hath not that strength and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his doctrine. Our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themselues confesse, and experience teacheth vs, that they often tymes change their interpretations of Scriptures, and at diuers tymes they teach plaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yea they confesse, that this their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate spirit is not permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with them, but often tymes leaueth and forsaketh them;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18739:9"/>
the which they proue out of that place of the 29. or 30. Psalme, the eight verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thou hast turned thy face from me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I became troubled.</hi> For thus they affirmed in that<note place="margin">Vide disp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paris an. 1566. in disp. 1. diei sub finem.</note> famous disputation had at <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Anno 1566.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> there wanteth that fulnesse &amp; sufficiency, because no priuat man can define all poynts of fayth: seeing that many were defined before he was borne against the ancient heretikes, and there wilbe many things defined in the Church after his death, assoone as there shall arise any new heresies.</p>
            <p n="6">6, <hi>Sixtly,</hi> there wanteth necessity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For before there was any priuate man which now liueth, there was true fayth, and the same fayth will continue after he is dead.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Seauently,</hi> there wanteth the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth property of the rule of fayth, seing that by this <hi>priuate spirit</hi> a Christian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be distinguished from an Infidell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in truth all heretikes do bragge, and boast that they haue this <hi>priuate spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Eightly,</hi> there wanteth the eight property. For no point of faith can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deduced out of this priuate spirit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18739:9"/>
only, seeing that it is oftentymes vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and deceitfull.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> there wanteth the ninth property<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it is a ridiculous thing for one to endeauour to conuert an infidell to the fayth by bragging only, that he hath this priuate spirit, the which none can eyther see or vnderstand.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> there wanteth the tenth and last property, because there is no mention made of this priuat and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler spirit in the Apostles Creed.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And the true spirit of faith which is in euery faythfull soule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle speaketh when he sayth, that <hi>we haue the spirit of fayth,</hi> is not the<note place="margin">2. ad Cor- inth. 4. v. 13.</note> ground or reason of fayth we heere speak of, but it is the helpe of God, or the supernaturall gift of fayth, whereby our vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is helped to belieue, and it is in regard of our vnderstanding, as it were the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause of the acts of faith.

            <p>THAT the Catholike and visible Church is the most solide and true ground of our faith is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly proued by the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Ground of faith. For all those ten properties do very well agree to the Church, and to nothing els besides. The Church hath the first property, to wit, a continuall and neuer-interrupted duration. For the Church hath alwaies<note place="margin">Supra cap. 3. huius Controu.</note> continued as we haue already proued euen by the testimony of our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Church also hath the second property, that is to say, a most certaine and vndoubted truth, because she can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Supra cap. 7. huius Controu.</note> erre in faith, as we haue proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. She hath also the third property, that is to say, the infallible certainty on our partes, because in the doctrine of the Church, we may haue the greatest cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, perspicuity, and euidency that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18739:12"/>
possibly we can desire. Seeing that the Church is alwaies present, who explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth alwaies her mynd vnto vs in plaine and manifest wordes. And if at any tyme there arise any doubt or Controuersy in her decrees, she presently declareth it no otherwise, then if the Prophets &amp; other writers of the ould and new Testament were yet aliue, and would clearly expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their mynds vnto vs in their owne proper words. For it is the same holy Ghost who in tymes past spake by the mouth of the Prophets and Apostles, and who speaketh now by the mouth of<note place="margin">Matth. 10. v. 20.</note> the Church: <hi>for it is not you that speake, but the spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Church hath the fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. For there is exceeding great stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and immutability in the doctrine of the Church. For this truly can neuer be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, falsified, or chaunged, because the Church is alwaies present, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies giueth most cleare and euident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of her owne doctrine. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine also of the Church remayneth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies constant and immoueable, because the holy Ghost is alwaies present who will not permit the Church to erre, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those wordes of Christ: <hi>I will</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Church hath the fifth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that is to say, the fulnesse and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of doctrine. For the Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all thinges necessary to saluation, according to that promise of Christ: When the spirit of truth shall come, he will teach you all truth. So that the<note place="margin">Ioan. 16. v. 13.</note> Church hath hitherto condemned all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, and heerafter also will condemne all errors arising and oppugning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith. In like manner she alwaies answereth to all doubtes and difficulties proposed vnto her, because she is alwaies present and alwaies liueth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Church hath also the sixt property, that is to say, necessity. For no doctrine must be recevued as a point of faith, vnlesse it be receyued and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Church, as we haue declared<note place="margin">Supra c. 8. huius Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trou.

            <p n="7">7. Yea and others could not safely
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18739:13"/>
belieue him vnlesse his doctrine had byn approued by the Church, as <hi>Tertullian, S. Hierome,</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine</hi> well note. <hi>The Apostle S. Paul</hi> (saith <hi>S.

Augustine.</hi> And much more the Ghospells of S. <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. And hence it is, that the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>S. Brigit,</hi> and <hi>S. Catherine</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> albeit they were truly reuealed vnto them by God, yet they do not appertayne to the Catholike faith, because they are not approued by the Church, as the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and certayne word of God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Euen as also in the Apostles tyme many before <hi>S. Luke</hi> wrote the acts of Christ, as <hi>S. Luke</hi> himself testifyeth, and<note place="margin">Luc 1. v. 1.</note> yet notwithstanding the <hi>Ghospells</hi> only of two of them, to wit <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> and S.

               <hi>Marks</hi> are authenticall, for it is well knowne that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> wrote his Ghospell long after <hi>S. Luke:</hi> but the Ghospells of the rest who wrote before <hi>S. Luke</hi> do not appertayne vnto faith, because they were neuer approued by the Church. Wherby it sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeareth, how necessary the approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; authority of the Church is.</p>
            <p n="10">10.

that our fayth doth so depend of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, that it being weakned or taken away, it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne or continue by any fayth of the Gospell.

Their first argument is, if the authority of the Church were the ground of fayth, then it would follow, that our faith relied vpon men and not vpon God, for the Church consisteth of men. Our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do often repeate and inculcat this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument vnto vs. I answere, that the same

argument, if it were any thing worth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would also proue that we should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue Scriptures, because al those who wrot the books of the Bibles were also men; but as we do belieue their writinges not because they were men, but because they had a certaine peculiar assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the holy Ghost who did so gouerne and direct the that they could not erre: so in like manner we belieue the Church, and make it the ground of our fayth, not as it consisteth of men, but as it hath a speciall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall assistance of the holy Ghost, by whome she is continually gouerned and directed: wherby it commeth to passe that she can neuer erre as we haue proued<note place="margin">Cap. 7. praecedent.</note> a little before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wherefore to make the Church the ground of our fayth is nothing els then to make the holy Ghost and Christ himselfe the ground therof. For it is he who spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto vs by the mouth of the Church according to that saying <hi>of S. Paul: Seeke you an experiment of him that speaketh in me, Christ?</hi> And in another place speaking of his own<note place="margin">2. ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18739:18"/>
Churches of <hi>Insidells</hi> and <hi>Heretikes,</hi> seeing that the chiefe part of the true Church of Christ is the holy Ghost, who is as it were the <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But neither is this to make the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or the holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ghost subiect &amp; inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our men (as our Aduersarise are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r to cauil) but o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to shew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the holy Ghost is euery where conformable to himselfe, &amp; that in all things he neuer differeth or disgreeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe. Whether he speake vnto vs by the holy Scripture, or by the mouth of the Church, as <hi>Caluin</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth<note place="margin">Calu. l. 1. Iust. c. 9. sect. 2.</note> disputing against the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> who by such an argument went about to reiect the holy Scriptures, to wit, least the holy Ghost might be made subiect, and inferiour vnto them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The second argument is, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> may and ought to <hi>iudge and examine all things,</hi> as the Apostle sayth, therefore the spirit of euery Christian ought to be the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of al things. I answere, that by the<note place="margin">1. ad Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18739:18"/>
vnto them, and which himselfe appointed; but this rule is not euery ones priuate spirit, but the spirit of the whole Church. For it is altogeather necessary that the rule of fayth be most certayne &amp; free from all errors, as the spirit of the whole Church is, and not that of euery<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 4. v. 6.</note> priuate man. Hereupon sayth <hi>S. Iohn, He which knoweth God heareth vs, he who is not of God, doth not heare vs: in this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</hi> We must ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iudge of euery man, by that they ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare or do not heare the Church, &amp;c because they either agree or disagree fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the spirit of the Catholike Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The third argument is, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes proue the Church and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof by the Scripture, therfore Scripture is rather the ground of fayth then the Church. I answere first, that the proofe of the Church which is taken out of Scriptures, when we dispute against heretikes, is an argument called by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and it is deduced out of the premises already graunted, in which manner also the first principles or grounds of euery science may be proued, and out of those thinges also which of themselues are not very strong and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18739:19"/>
So out of the old Testament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> we proue the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, albeit this also is the ground of our fayth: because the <hi>Iewes</hi> do admit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the old Testament but not the new, yea also euen out of the <hi>Iewish Talmud</hi> we proue many things against the <hi>Iewes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they admit and approue it as the word of God, but yet their <hi>Talmud</hi> is not the ground of our fayth, because this only is, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> sayd, an argument deduced out of such thinges as they graunt vnto vs. So in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner because almost al heretikes admit the Scripture, and reiect the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, therefore when we dispute against them, we proue the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church by the Scriptures, as premisses already graunted by them. But if we were to deale with <hi>Infidells</hi> or others who doe not admit the Scriptures, then the sayd Scriptures were to be proued by the authority of the Church and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise. For it is a thing farre better and more commonly knowne, that there<note place="margin">Infra. c. 18. huius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ir. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. 10.</note> is a Church, then that there are the holy Scriptures, as afterward we will shew more clearly.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly I answere, that there is so great connexion betwixt the Scripture
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18739:19"/>
and the Church, that the Scripture may very well be proued by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, and againe the church by the authority of the Scripture. Neyther should this seeme strange to our Aduersaries. For <hi>Logicians</hi> also know very well that, that which by it owne nature is more certayne &amp; better knowne, may be proued by that which is more certaine and better knowne vnto vs, by a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, called by them <hi>à posteriori.</hi> And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wise that which is better knowne vnto vs, may be proued by that which is better knowne and more certaine in his owne nature, by a demonstration called <hi>à priori.</hi> So the cause is proued by the effect &amp; the effect by the cause; as fyte is proued by heate <hi>à posteriori,</hi> and heate by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fyre <hi>à priori.</hi> So in like manner by the authority of the Church, the which in regard of vs, is more certayne and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne, we proue the Scripture, as it were <hi>à posteriorl,</hi> and by the authority of the Scripture which in it owne nature is more certaine, we proue the true Church of Christ as it were <hi>à priori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The fourth argument. <hi>S. Paul</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyeth, that the Church is supported by the ground and foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18739:20"/>
and Apostles, that is tosay, by their Propheticall and Apostolicall doctrine, but if the foresaid doctrine be the ground of the Church, it necessarily followeth that this doctrine appeared to be certaine in it selfe, before the Church began to be. The Church therefore must<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be that which giueth certainty to the doctrine or writings of the Apostles, but rather their doctrine and writings do affoard suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient certainty to the Church. So <hi>Caluin.</hi>

            <p n="13">13. But <hi>Caluin</hi> erreth in this, that he thinketh <hi>S. Paul</hi> to treate in this place of the Scripture only of the Apostles and Prophets. For not only the Apostolicall Scripture is the ground of our faith, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18739:21"/>
all the doctrine of the Apostles. And few of the twelue Apostles, to wit, only fiue, haue written any thing, but of the other seauen, there are no writings extant, but yet they all taught; the Apostle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speaketh of the Apostolicall doctrine and not only of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But neyther do we deny that faith dependeth of the Apostles doctrine yea more then that we say that our faith dependeth of the doctrine of the present Church. For when we affirme that the<note place="margin">Ad Rom. 10. v. 17.</note> Church is the ground of our faith, we do not vnderstand by the Church, the shoulders or bodyes of them who are in her, but their authority doctrine, and preaching; for by these thinges faith is ingendred, and as the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>faith is by hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. But whensoeuer we treate of the true Church of Christ we do not speake of that which wanteth true faith, which is deafe, dumme, or foolish, and which also eyther neglecteth, or not vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Word of God or Scriptures, for such a Church is not the true Church of Christ.

Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs therfore all these wordes haue one and the same signification, the Church, the faith of the Church, the preaching and doctrine of the Church, the word of God preached by the Church, and the truth of God proposed vnto vs by the Church.

            <p n="16">16.

Therfore the Apostolicall &amp; Propheticall doctrine must not be separated and made opposite vnto the Church, as <hi>Caluin</hi> doth, seeing that it is an essentiall part of the visible Church. <hi>Caluin</hi> therefore disputeth as if one should make this argument. A man

            <p n="17">17.

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That the Church doth not only giue a bare testimony, but also authority to the Scripture.</head>
            <p>THIS matter is heere briefly to be examined, that it may more clearly be vnderstood how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary the Churches approbation is to the establishing of the authority of the holy Scriptures. But to the end that it may more clearely appeare wherof we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute in this place, it is to be considered,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18739:23"/>
that seing that our Aduersaries cannot deny, but that the Church affoardeth some testimony to the holy Scriptures, they affirme, that this testimony of the Church is only a bare testimony, and not a testimony of authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For there are two kindes of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonyes. The one is called a testimony of authority, because vpon it, the truth of the things testified dependeth. Yt is called also a necessary testimony, because without it the thing in question is not sufficiently testified. The other is called a bare testimony and not necessary, that is to say, when such a testimony is not so necessary, because the matter is otherwise<note place="margin">Ioan 1. v. 7</note> sufficiently testified. Such a testimony was that, which S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> gaue of <hi>Christ.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> had sufficient testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies besides.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of the former testimony of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Christ saith. <hi>But I do not receyue my</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan 5. v. 34. Eodem. c. 5. v. 36.</note> 
               <hi>testimony from men,</hi> to wit, the testimony of authority &amp; necessary. For of the bare testimony he had spoken a little before: <hi>You sent vnto Iohn, and he hath giuen testimony to truth.</hi> But this was a bare testimony: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Eodem c. 5. v. 36. Cap. 5.</note> Christ a little after said, <hi>I haue a greater testimony then Iohn, for the workes which the</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:18739:24"/>
               <hi>Father hath giuen me to profit them: the very works which I do, giue testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me. And the Father that sent me, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath guien testimony of me.</hi> All which saith Christ of the testimony of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Our Aduersaries therefore say, that the Church giueth only a bare testimony to the Scriptures, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> gaue to <hi>Christ,</hi> but she giueth not a necessary testimony or that of authority.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But that the testimony of the Church, is altogeather necessary, as that<note place="margin">Matth. 3. v. vlt. Matth. 17. v. 5.</note> wherof the authority of the Scriptures dependeth, is very manifest by that which is said in the former Chapter. And by that also which we alleadged in the first disputation, where we shew that there is now no firme testimony wherby we may know certainly, which booke is canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and which not, besides the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Catholike Church. For now neyther are the miracles wrought which God did in tymes past, neyther doth God speake immediatly by himselfe, as he spake in the baptisme and transfiguration of Christ. VVherefore there remayneth only the third ordinary manner, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God speaketh by the mouth of the Church. The Church therfore doth not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18739:24"/>
giue a bare testimony only to the holy Scripturs, but the testimony of authority, to wit, that wherof the authority of the Scriptures dependeth, as concerning vs and our knowledge.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Moreouer if the doctine of <hi>S. Paul</hi> stood need of the Churches appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as we haue already proued out of<note place="margin">Suprac. 8. &amp; 13. huius Controu.</note> the Scriptures, much more <hi>S. Lukes Ghospell</hi> who was only <hi>S. Pauls</hi> scholler stood need therof, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> witnesseth, especially because <hi>S. Luke</hi> receyued not those things<note place="margin">Tertul. l. 4 contra Marci. c. 2. Luc. 1. v. 2.</note> which he wrot by reuelation from God, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> did, but by tradition from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as he himselfe writeth. And the same also may be said of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> whose Ghospell, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> writeth, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>S. Peter</hi> approued, and by his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he commaunded it should be read in the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But neyther is it true that some say, that the authority of approuing the Canonicall bookes was only resident in the Apostles and the primitiue Church; but the ensuing Church hath is not. For the Apostles did not approue all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall bookes of the new testament. For if they had donne so, there had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned no doubt of many of them for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18739:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many ages after the death of the Apostles, euen among Catholike good men as we haue noted before: But many yeares after the Apostles tyme by the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells and Decrees of the Church, some<note place="margin">Supra cap. 5. Contr. 1.</note> bookes were approued, wherof there was before some doubt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Yea more then six hundred yeares after Christ, there were many Catholikes who did not receyue the authority of the<note place="margin">Toletanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Concil. c. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as appeareth out of the fourth <hi>Toletane Councell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. And that which is more before the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> the were many Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes who thought that it was lawfull for them to doubt of all the bookes of the new Testament, the which in tymes past: <hi>S, Hierome</hi> seemed to iudge as doubtfull; as are the Epistles of <hi>S. Iames,</hi> the second of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> the second and third of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> the Epistles of <hi>S. Iude,</hi> the Epistles <hi>to the Hebrewes,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> And if it had not byn for the Councell of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or some other new Decree of the Church, none would as yet condemne them as Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, who called those bookes in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. By that which hath byn sayd it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth manifestly, that the Canonicall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18739:25"/>
Scriptures receiue their strength and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not from the approbation of the primitiue Church, but rather from the approbation of the Church succeeding; yea euen of this present Church, to wit, of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Lastly albeit the present Church should not haue the authority of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Scriptures, as these men say, yet notwithstanding for three other reasons the authority &amp; testimony of this present Church is necessary. First, because we know not certainly what bookes the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church hath eyther written, or not written, approued or reiected, but by the testimony of the present Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, neyther do we know whether those bookes came vncorrupted vnto vs or noe, but by the same testimony.

               <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Argument of our Aduersaryes are confuted.</head>
            <p>THE first argument of our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries is: The Church is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the word of God; and by the word also of God it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, nourished, and gouerned, and it is subiect to the word of God as to the words of her spouse. I answere, our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries do in a manner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God, with the word of God in generall, the which they should not doe: for ther are three sorts of the word of God to wit, that which is belieued, preached, and written. The belieued word is in the hart of the Church, that which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched is in her mouth, and that which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> written is in her bookes. Of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and preached word, the Apostle sayth: <hi>the word is in thy mouth, and in thy hart, this is the word of fayth which we preach.</hi> We<note place="margin">Rom. 20. v. 8.</note> confesse, that in the belieued and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18739:26"/>
word the Church is founded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the same it is ingendred, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,<note place="margin">Ad Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> and gouerned, and that vnto this word it is subiect and obedient, as vnto the Words of her spouse. For indeed this kind of word is necessary for the Church. <hi>For with our hart</hi> (sayth the Apostle) <hi>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue vnto Iustice, but with the mouth confession is made to saluation.</hi> And againe, <hi>How shall they heare without a preacher?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But the nature of the written word is farre different; for this is neyther alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather necessary for the Church, seeing that the Church was without it more then two thousand yeares; neyther can the written word be profitable to the Church, vnlesse it be also rightly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and belieued. For what doth it profit a man to haue the Bible, vnlesse he rightly belieue and vnderstand it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the Scripture whereof we now dispute, doth only conteyne written word, but the belieued and preached word are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the visibe Church, as the necessary and essentiall parts therof: seing the one is as it were the life in the hart of the Church, the other as it were the speach in her mouth: neyther can they euer be separated from her, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18739:27"/>
to that saying and promise of God: <hi>The words which I haue put in thy month shall not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiae 59. v. v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Wherefore this argument doth proue the quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, for seeing that the written word receiueth it pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the rightly belieued and preached word, which are the partes of the Church; it is necessary that the written word receiue that authority and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ity from the Church, as that, wherin only the word rightly preached and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued is to be found.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The second argument. If the Church should teach any thing contrary to the Scriptures we were not to belieue the Church. Therefore the Scripture doth not rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ue that authority from the Church, but rather the Church from the Scripture. I answere, that in the same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner it may be said, that if the Scripture should conteine any thing against truth, we should not also belieue it; if the holy Ghost should vtter and speake any ly, we should not belieue him. But these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are indeed impossible, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous against God; wherefore they are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18739:27"/>
not only, to be admitted but not euen to be proposed of Christians. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the Church should teach any thing contrary to the Scriptures, for then the holy Ghost should lye, because he should teach one thing by the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the contrary by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The third argument, if the Scripture receiue that authority from the Church, then the Church should be aboue the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which seemeth to be very absurd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>. That the Church is aboue the Scripture, may be vnderstood two wayes. First, because the Church exceedeth the Scripture in dignity and excellency, and in this sense, without all doubt, the Church is aboue the Scripture, for the Scripture is made for the Church, and<note place="margin">1. ad Cor. 4. v. 15.</note> not contrarywise. <hi>All things</hi> (sayth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles) <hi>are done for you.</hi> Christ dyed for the Church, and not for the Scriptures: the Church belieueth, hopeth, loueth and praysed God, but the Scripture doth none of these: The Church shall reigne and liue euerlastingly with Christ in heauen: the Scripture shall perish after the day of Iudgement. Lastly the Church contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it the word of God rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued,

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Secondly it may be vnderstood that the Church is aboue the Scripture, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or depart from the true sense of Scripture: In which sense the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of this tyme say, that we affirme the Church to be aboue the Scripture. And thus it is falso that the Church is aboue the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: but neyther is there any Catholike which in this sense will affirme that the<note place="margin">Beilarm l. 3. de verbo Dei c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vlt. in resp. ad 14 argum.</note> Church is aboue the Scripture, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> truly affirmeth. For if the Church were in this sense aboue the Scripture, the Church should erre, and be opposite vnto her selfe, because in that, the Church hath once approued the Scripture she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="8">8. The fourth argument. The holy Scripture receiueth her authority imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himselfe because he is the Author of the Scripture, therefore it

            <p>SEING that there arise dayly so many disputations and Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syes of matters of faith, none can deny, but that there must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be some Iudge appointed, who must define, end, and determine such Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersyes, for otherwise there will neuer be an end of such matters But it is a great difficulty who must be this Iudge. The Sectaries of this tyme almost all refuse the Iudgment of the Church. For they see very well, that if they admit her as iudge all their errors wilbe quit ouerthrowne. Wherfore some of them affirme that the sole Scripture must be the Iudge of all Controuersies, and this was the first do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Aduersaries, to wit, <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Zuinglius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But our later Aduersaries when they consider, that it is an absurd thing<note place="margin">Cap. 18. Contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>.</note> to make the Scripture (being a thing without life) the Iudge, as we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18739:30"/>
before, they fly vnto their priuate spirit, the which they will haue the iudge of all Controuersies. But least they may seeme to attribute too much vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they endeauour to colour their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate spirit with the famous title or name of the holy Ghost, affirming the holy Ghost to be the only iudge of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersyes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. VVherfore there are three thinges heere to be proued. First, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be iudge. Secondly, that neyther the priuate spirit can be it. Thirdly, that the Catholike Church is the only, and most true Iudge of all Controuersies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As concerning the first, wheras our Aduersaries euery where teach, that nothing is to be belieued which is not expressely to be found in holy Scriptures, it is a strange thing, that they would perswade men that the Scripture is the Iudge of all Controuersies: wheras we read no such thing in any place of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yea euen in these, testimony is only attributed to the Scriptures, and not Iudgment. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (saith Christ)<note place="margin">Ioan. 5. v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>and the same are they that giue testimony of me.</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18739:30"/>
And hence it is, that the law of God is often called in Scripture in the Hebrew phrase <hi>Eda,</hi> or <hi>Eduth,</hi> or <hi>Teuda,</hi> that is to say,<note place="margin">Psalm. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> a testimony; yea euen in one Psalme it is called aboue twenty tymes by that name.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Moreouer in the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> in the same place falsely cited by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, that they may proue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Scripture to be the iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, it is called a <hi>witnesse,</hi> or a <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and not a Iudge, nay rather to the<note place="margin">Isaiae 8. v. 20.</note> Law, saith the Prophet, and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Furthermore, nothing is more absurd then in matters of such moment to appoint such a deafe and dumme iudge, and who may also be corrupted for both parties, and whose sentence ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party vseth indifferently. But it is manifest, that the Scripture is such a iudge, for it can neyther speake nor heare: and so in like manner do all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes ancient and moderne also vse the Scriptures. Lastly almost all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries do see, how absurd these things are, and therfore they fly vnto their owne priuate spirit, the which they call the holy Ghost. Wherfore-let vs come now
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18739:31"/>
to the second point.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As concerning therefore this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate spirit, first there is none who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but that the holy Ghost is the chiefe Iudge of all Controuersyes. But the question is, where this holy spirit is to be found, and in whome it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Moreouer it is certaine, that the holy Ghost doth not remayne, or is to be found in any booke (least peraduenture our Aduersaries should send vs to their Bibles) but in the hartes of the belieuers. Now we aske whether this holy Ghost which is the Iudge of all be in the hart of euery belieuer, or rather in the hart of the whole Catholike Church. If they say in the hart of the Catholike Church, we haue our desire: if they say in the hart of euery priuate man, it will follow that no priuate person can erre in his owne iudgement, seeing that the holy Ghost cannot erre in his iudgement. Heere truely we seeke for that Iudge which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Furthermore euery priuate man shallbe come the Iudge of the whole Church, if euery such priuate person haue this spirit, which is the Iudge of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18739:31"/>
whole Church: wherupon there will ensue a great confusion in the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Besides that, if euery belieuer be the Iudge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Aduersaries must needs admit the auncient Fathers as Iudges of all Coutrouersies, the which they will neuer do, for they dare not deny, but that the auncient Fathers were true belieuers: why therefore do they attribute vnto themselues that which they so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently deny to all the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
            <p n="12">12. Moreouer, if euery belieuer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor erre in his iudgement, much lesse can a great many such erre, and least of all can the Church of all belieuers erre. Wherefore whatsoeuer our Aduersaries say, they wilbe forced to confesse and graunt, that the holy Ghost is the Iudge as he remaineth in the whole Church, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and iudging by the mouth therof, and in this manner euen out of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries doctrine we gather by a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequence our opinion.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Lastly, that which they affirme that the priuate spirit of euery particuler person is Iudge, is therby declared to be false, that they themselues acknowledge
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18739:32"/>
that there is no priuate man which at some tymes cannot erre in his iudgment: but heere we inquire for a Iudge which cannot erre. For otherwise in matters of such moment, and of which our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation dependeth, we should dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously be forced to haue recourse to an erroneous Iudge, whose iudgement is variable, vncertaine, deceitfull, and often tymes manifestly false.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But now as concerning the third point, that the Church is the iudge of all Controuersies, we proue by these arguments. First, the Church hath all the properties of a fit iudge, for first she hath an exact knowledge, <hi>the holy Ghost</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>shall teach you,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. Secondly, the Church cannot be corrupted by any giftes or praiers. For she is as the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. ad Tim. 3. v. 15.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="16">16. Thirdly, the Church heareth, speaketh, giueth her iudgment, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amineth the testimonyes of Scriptures and Fathers, as experience it selfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eheth vs.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Fourthly, we are bound to stand to the iudgement of the Church, <hi>VVho will not heare the Church,</hi> saith our Lord, <hi>let</hi>

                  </gap>sieth. I would to God, they would shew vs such a Church, as the holy Scripture doth paint or describernto vs, we would easily agree about the honour thereof.</hi> Thus he. But we will shew in the ensuing Chapters such a Church as the Scripture describeth: I wish also we may agree concerning the honour and authority thereof.</p>
            <p n="27">27. There are two principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Aduersaries: the first is, that the holy Ghost is not tyed vnto men, but iudgeth freely in whatsoeuer it pleaseth him, therefore he is not tyed vnto the Church. But the same argument would proue, that there is no certainty in the holy Scriptures. For they who wrote the Scriptures were men, vnto whome, according to our Aduersaries opinion,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18739:34"/>
the holy Ghost was not tyed. I answere therfore that the holy Ghost is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutly bound or tyed vnto men, but he is tyed to his owne, Promise, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the words and promises of <hi>Christ.</hi> For neyther the holy Ghost, nor <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe can deceiue vs in not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their promises, because as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle<note place="margin">Ad Titum 1. v. 2.</note> sayth God cannot lye. But God hath promised that he wilbe with his <hi>Church,</hi> not only one or two dayes, or one yeare, <hi>but euen till the end of the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. vit. v. vit.</note> He promised, that he <hi>would giue the holy Ghost to remayne and stay with vs,</hi> not for one on two yeares only, <hi>but euerlastingly.</hi> It is needfull therfore that he performe and stand to his promises.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The second argument. If those things which we haue said of the Church as Iudge, were true, it would also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Church is Iudge of the holy Scripture, and consequently of the word of God in generall. I answere that the word of God in generall cannot be called in question or doubted of by any which professeth Christ. For the diuine fayth cannot be without some word of God, but where there is noe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy, there is no neede of any Iudge.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18739:35"/>
But if of any one part of the word of God, whether it be written or not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, there arise any controuersy, as for<note place="margin">Iohn 14. v. 16.</note> example, of the true sense of the written word, without doubt we must recurre vnto the iudgement of the Church: for it belongeth vnto her to iudge of the true sense of the holy Scripture, and of the exposition thereof (which is the chiefer part of the written word) as also of any doubtfull letter of the holy Scripture: for seeing that in tymes: past, there haue beene many controuersyes of diuers books of holy Scripture, and of the particuler Chapters and parts thereof, as also of the true sense of the letter, and other written poynts of sayth, it is manifest, that noe other Iudge but the Catholike Church hath ended or defined all these contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersyes.</p>
            <p n="29">29. But in this iudgement of the Church there are two thinges to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered; the one, that the Church doth not iudge of any part of the word of God out of her owne proper sense and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Concil Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. sess. 4. Calu. l 4. Instit. c. 8. sect. 13.</note> or at her owne pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word of God, as her Aduersaries, and namely <hi>Caluin</hi> doth wrongfully slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her, but by one part of the word of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18739:35"/>
God which is better knowen, she iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of that which is lesse knowen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nd manifest vnto vs: as for example by the word of God deliuered by Traditions, she iudgeth of the written word of God, and of the true sense therof.</p>
            <p n="30">30. The other thing to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is, that when the Church doth<note place="margin">Act. 15. v. 28.</note> iudge of these things they are not men only which iudge as our Aduersaries pretend, but the holy Ghost also himselfe who iudgeth and speaketh vnto vs by the Church. <hi>It seemed good,</hi> say the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>to the holy Ghost and vs.</hi> For euen as the actions of a mans body, are not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the actions of the body, as of the soule which quickneth and moueth the body: so the actions of the whole Catholike Church, are not so much to be attributed vnto men, who are as it were the body of the visible Church, as vnto the holy Ghost, who is as it were the soule which giueth lyfe and motion to the body of the Church. They ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who deny this iudgement of the Church, are not only iniurious to the Church, but also to the holy Ghost. Hitherto of the properties, offices, and power of the true Church of Christ.
