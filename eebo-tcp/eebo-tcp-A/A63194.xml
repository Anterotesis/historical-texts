            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On Saturday the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>Jan. 1679,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> was brought to the Bar of the Court of <hi>Kings-bench,</hi> to be Arraigned for High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Treason; which was done accordingly in this manner.</p>

               <p>Then somebody must repeat it that stands by him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Do you hear what I say to you?</p>

            <p>Then the Clerk of the Crown went down close to the Bar, and went on thus:</p>

and with all thy power intending to disturb the Peace and common Tranquillity of this Realm, and to bring and put our said Lord the King to death and final destruction; and the true Worship of God in this Kingdom, by Law established and used, to alter unto the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to move and stir up War against our said Lord the King in this Realm, and to subvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kingdom; The thirtieth day of <hi>May,</hi> in the one and thirtieth year of our said Lord the King's Reign, at the Parish of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> in <hi>Elmett</hi> in the said County of <hi>York,</hi> in the <hi>West-Riding</hi> of the same County, with divers other false Traytors unknown, didst tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously compass, imagine, and intend the death and final destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our said Lord the King; and to change and alter, and wholly to subvert the ancient Government of this Realm; and to depose, and wholly to deprive the King of the Crown and Government of this Kingdom; and to root out the true Protestant Religion.

And the sooner to fulfil and accomplish the same most wicked Treasons and trayterous Imaginations and purposes, thou the said <hi>Gascoyne,</hi> and other unknown Traytors, then and there, advisedly, maliciously, and trayterously, did further consult and agree to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, pay, and expend divers large sums of money to divers of the King's Subjects and other persons unknown, to procure those persons unknown trayterously to kill our said Lord the King, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Roman Religion into this Realm. And that thou the said <hi>Gascoyne</hi> afterwards (to wit) on the said thirtieth day of <hi>May,</hi> in the one and thirtieth year aforesaid, at the Parish aforesaid, didst false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, advisedly, craftily, maliciously, and trayterously, sollicit one <hi>Robert Bolron</hi> to kill our said Lord the King; and then and there, with an intent sooner trayterously to encourage the said <hi>Bolron</hi> to undertake the killing and murthering of our said Lord the King, offeredst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give and pay the said <hi>Bolron</hi> a thousand pounds of lawful money of <hi>England:</hi> against the duty of thy Allegiance, against the Peace of our said Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity, and against the form of the Statute in such Case made and provided. <hi>How sayest thou, Sir</hi> Thomas Gascoyne, <hi>art thou guilty of this High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof thou standest indicted, and hast been now arraigned, or not guilty?</hi>

You shall understand, that he stands indicted by the name of Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoigne</hi> late of the Parish of <hi>Elmet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prout in the Indictment mutatis mutandis.</hi> Upon this Indictment he hath been arraigned, and thereunto pleaded Not guiltie; and for his Trial hath put himself upon his Countrie; which Countrie you are, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jurie, Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoigne</hi> Baronet, the Prisoner at the Bar, stands indicted for high Treason, in conspiring the Murder of his Majestie, the Subverting of the Government, and the introducing the Romish Religion. And for the effecting these purposes, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment sets forth, That the said Sir <hi>Thomas Gaseoigne,</hi> Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> and other false Traytors, the 30th of <hi>May</hi> last, at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of <hi>Elmet</hi> in the <hi>West-riding</hi> of the Countie of <hi>York,</hi> did assemble together, and there resolved to put their Treasons in execution. And the better to accomplish their said Treasons and traiterous Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they did agree to contribute several large sums of money to several of his Majesties Subjects unknown, to introduce Poperie, to kill the King, and subvert the Government: And that Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gascoigne</hi> did sollicit <hi>Robert Bolrond</hi> to kill the King, and for that service he was to pay him 1000<hi>l.</hi> To this he hath pleaded Not guiltie: if the Kings Evidence prove the Charge of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your dutie is to finde him guiltie.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jurie, you have heard the Indictment, and it hath been opened to you. There can be no greater Crime charged upon any, than that this Gentleman is accused of. The designe hath been to kill and murder the King, to change the Religion and the Government; and to effect this, they make Assemblies, they offer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60716:6"/>
Money: and this, my Lord, we shall prove. 'Tis no new Crime, divers have suffered for the like alreadie; and we shall not need to make any aggravations, for indeed it cannot be aggravated more than the plain matter it self is. We shall call our Witnesses, and prove it directly upon him, even by two Witnesses; and we shall prove, that he held intelligence with one <hi>Preswicke</hi> a Priest; Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between him and that person are found in his custodie, and we shall produce one of them wherein it does appear, that there was Intelligence between them, and Consultations had about the Oath of Allegiance; and that <hi>Praud</hi> did write to him, that it was a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Oath condemned by the Sorbonnists: And upon that point hangs the changing of Religion; for the Oath of Allegiance is the great Touchstone to discover mens sinceritie by, and the great Bond to tie them to the Government, and to the Protestant Religion. And we shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ikewise prove another Passage in a Letter indorsed with the Prisoner's own hand, wherein there is an expression to this purpose: <hi>That if</hi> England <hi>be converted,</hi> (the Priest writes this to him) <hi>then how a sum of Ninety pound was to be disposed:</hi> which was, as you shall hear, and we shall prove, in a Nunnery. <hi>If</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>be converted,</hi> that clearly shews what was their intention, not onely to destroy the King, but the Religion and the Nation; and so they were conspiring not onely against his Majestie, but against God. That an old Gentleman that hath lived so long under the peace of this Nation, and been so protected by the Government, which hath been so indulgent to men of his perswafion, should be guiltie of such a designe, is a lamentable thing to think of; That he should so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Law, which hath been so milde in its execution against such men. We shall prove the proffer of the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and so leave it with you.</p>

                  </gap>, and which I believe may have a great influence in the Cause, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

be likely to produce very bad effects, which is that Letter from the Priest, wherein he decries the Oath of Allegiance as a damnable thing condemned by the Doctrines at <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and other Priests from <hi>Rome.</hi> And this had its effect a little time before; for it was ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

And there will be some other concurring Evidence in this Cause, and that is by some Papers taken in Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gascoigne</hi>'s own hand; they are Almanacks, in which many of his own Memorials are, several sums of money mentioned to be paid, and returned to Priests at <hi>London:</hi> the Witnesses will tell you it was returned for the designe of the Plot. There happens to be 900 <hi>l.</hi> returned to Mr. <hi>Corker,</hi> who is now in Newgate; and some other sums to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who is executed; and some money is paid to him, though I think not much, about 25 <hi>l.</hi> and several sums are mentioned, and great sums returned to <hi>London</hi> by Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoigne,</hi> in five or six years time, 5 or 6000 <hi>l.</hi> to what purpose I can't tell; they will give you an account: I think he did live always in <hi>York-shire</hi> himself, never used to come to Town; and what occasion he might have of returning money, I don't know. We will call the two Witnesses <hi>viva voce,</hi> and then use the other Evidence as we shall have occasion to confirm them. Call Mr. <hi>Bolrond</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mowbray.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>I was in the next Room, and the door was not shut; and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did say—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Tell the discourse, what it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>He said he was resolved to make a collusive convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Estate, for fear it should be forfeited to the King. And <hi>Charles Ingleby</hi> said, it was best so to do: and then he told Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> he wou'd have the Defeazance made ready, which he would draw with his own hands; but he bid him be sure to bring none but Protestant Witnesses along with him to testifie. And in the year 1675 I did go along with Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoigne</hi> to Sir <hi>William In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleby</hi>'s of <hi>Ripley,</hi> and there I did see him receive colourably 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>How do you know it was colourably?</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60716:7"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>I did hear Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> tell <hi>Charles Ingleby</hi> so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>When was that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>The 7th or 8th of <hi>April;</hi> the Deed bears the 8th of <hi>April</hi> 1675.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Was <hi>Charles Ingleby</hi> there at that time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, when the Deed was sealed; and he read it in the presence of the Witnesses to be dated at that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Justice Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>What, that thousand pound was the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Deed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it was. Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoigne</hi> did part thereby with all his Estate for seven years, he allowing him 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year for his maintenance, besides the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> at first paid. And this was done with that intent, for fear he should be discovered in the Plot for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>How do you know that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>I did hear Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoigne</hi> and Sir <hi>Miles Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> discourse of it, and he said it was for that end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Where was that discourse?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>In Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoigne</hi>'s Bed-chamber.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Justice Jones.</speaker>
               <p>When was that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>It was in or about the discovery of the Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But you say you saw the Deed sealed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I was a Witness to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>And you saw the money paid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>I and one <hi>Matthias Higgringill</hi> did help to count it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Justice Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Were you a Protestant at that time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, I was at the time of the sealing the Deed; but I did hear the discourse between Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> upon the discoverie of the Plot, when I was a Papist.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>When was the discourse you speak of with Sir <hi>Miles Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi> do you say?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>It was about the discoverie of the Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>After the money paid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, after the money paid: And he said to Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> he had done well to make over his Estate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>That is an abrupt thing for him to say; how did he begin the discourse?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>They were discoursing about the discoverie of the Plot by Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe;</hi> and then Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> said to Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> I have done well to make over my Estate to Sir <hi>William Ingleby,</hi> to prevent a forfeiture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>What said Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You seemed but now, as if he had said he was in the Plot.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Justice Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Did he own he was in the Plot?</p>

               <p>He did allow of it, and thought it was the best way so to do. I have seen him return several sums by <hi>Richard Phisicke.</hi>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, I came in when they were discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, because I knew of it. I was brought in by one <hi>Rushton,</hi> who was acquainted with the Plot, to know of it, and therefore they did not stop when I came in.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>No, but in 76 he said he would do it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>And it should be employed for carrying on of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, those were the words.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Was no body there but he, Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> and you?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and engaged me in the Plot.</p>

               <p>The discourse was upon establishing a Nunnery at <hi>Dolebank,</hi> in hopes that the Plot of killing the King would take effect; the intention was to alter the Government, and introduce the Romish Religion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>It was spoken by Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> and the rest of the Gentlemen.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, Sir <hi>Francis Hungatt</hi> said it several times.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>They were mutually resolved, and they would talk that they would venture their Lives and Estates in hopes the Plot would take effect; and accordingly about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1677, or near upon as I remember—</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was sometimes in the Room, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out. What discourse I heard, I tell you; there was one <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe</hi>—</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>I have had two Orders of Council for the seizing of him, and never could take him; he is a Priest.</p>

                  <hi>Gascoyne</hi> also because he would be sure there should no damage come to him caused all his goods to be sold off his ground, and Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> sold his very houshold goods.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I thought I had done nothing that was evil, because several had taken the Oath with me as you shall hear afterward.</p>

               <p>I told him that several others had done, as well as I, that were Papists, and they judged it lawful, whereupon he said, <hi>Away,</hi> and told me I was a fool, and knew not how to judge of an Oath.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>
               <p>So you were satisfied the Papists might take the Oath?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I told him I thought it was no sin to take that Oath, because it was an Oath only to be true to my King and to my Country, and I told him that Mr. <hi>Ellis</hi> Priest to Mr. <hi>Vauasor</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten comentaries upon the Oath and justified the taking of it. Said he again, Mr. <hi>Ellis</hi> was a fool and his Superiors will call him to an accompt, and check him for his paines. But said he by taking the Oath you have denyed the power of the Pope to absolve you from it, but I tell you he hath a power to depose the King and had done it: and said he, you will merit heaven if you will kill him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rushton</hi> my Lord said, it was a meritorious Act to kill the King.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>
               <p>But did Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> or any of the Company wish you to do that thing?</p>

               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>
               <p>What did he say?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rushton</hi> did. And he told me the Pope had granted him the power, that I should have the benefit of absolution if I would do it. I desired him not to perswade me to do such a thing, for I would have no hand in it; then he quoted a certain place of Scripture to me which was, thou shalt bind their Kings in Fetters and their Princes in Chaines. Whereupon he concluded, and made this exposition, that the Pope had deposed the King, and absolved all his Subjects, and it was a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Act to kill the King. And that unless the King would turn Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick the Pope would give away his Kingdomes to another?</p>

               <p>Then I told him I would have no hand in that Act and deed, whereupon he answered me again, you may hang me if you please for speaking these words. No Sir, said I, I will do you no injury if you do your self none. So he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Yes, and the same day as soon as I came down. I was told Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> had left order with his Servants that I should not depart the house till he came in, and I stay'd there till about six of the Clock.</p>

               <p>No in (79) my Lord, last <hi>May.</hi> My Lord I watched and stayd till he came in, and took him as he came in. I went up stayers with him, and when we came into his Chamber he calls me to him, and asked me what discourse had passed between me and <hi>Rushton;</hi> I told him our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was concerning the Oath of Allegiance, and the lawfulness, or unlawfulness of it. Then Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> took me by the hand, and told me, well man if thou wilt undertake a designe that I and others have to kill the King, I will give thee 1000. l. and I will send thee to my Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> if he be in Town, but if he be not in Town, he said he would give me such Instructions that I should find the rest that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the business.—</p>

               <p>My Lord, I told him I would have no hand in blood, and would not do such a wicked deed, and desired him to perswade me no more. Then he desired me of all love to keep secret what he had said. But afterwards I recollected that it was a very ill thing, and went immediately to the Justices of the Peace.—</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it was because there was one <hi>Henry Addison,</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Johnson</hi> did seek to take my work and service out of my hands. Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gascoyne</hi> did desire me to let them come in to see what they could do, and that I should have my Sallary, and that I should gather in his Debts; I was willing to be rid of it, and told him they that looked after the Pit should gather in the Debts, for I conceived else it would be but a double Charge to him.</p>

               <p>One thing more I would speak to. It was in <hi>September</hi> 1678 a little before the discovery of the Plot, I did hear Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> say, and tell my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ady <hi>Tempest,</hi> that he would send 150 l. to <hi>Dolebanke</hi> in hopes the blow would be given shortly.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Ser. <hi>Mayn.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That is the same word used by all the Wittnesses.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>
               <p>When was this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>In <hi>September</hi> (78) the Plot was not known by us to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered then, as I know of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>
               <p>Who did he speak it to?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>To his Daughter the Lady <hi>Tempest.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>
               <p>What said she?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>She seemed to like it very well, I did not hear any thing to the contrary. And I heard a Letter read afterwards from <hi>Cornwallis</hi> that he had received it, but it was too little for the carrying on so great a designe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>

               <p>And it was for the arming the poor Catholicks when the blow should be given.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Just.</speaker>
               <p>Is his Daughter living?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I shall desire to ask but one Question which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Prisoners at the Bar. How long after the discourse that you had with the Priest in the Gallery was it that Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> spoke to you of the same thing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Just. Pem.</hi>

               <p>Mr <hi>Recorder,</hi> if you ask him but one Question let it not be that which he hath answered before, he says the same day.</p>

               <p>I desire to ask him one Question.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Just. Pem.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, tell Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> first what he hath said, and see if he will ask any Questions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Hob.</hi>

               <p>Yes, he says, they all met at his house, and there they had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of killing the King. In what Room was it?</p>

               <p>No, it was about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1676.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>The Title of it was, as I remember, <hi>A List of them that are engaged in the Design of Killing the</hi> King, <hi>and promoting the</hi> Catholick Religion.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Just. Pemberton.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Was it mentioned in the List, <hi>for Killing the King?</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes. And then they declared also, That the Pope had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Commission to put on the Design, and prosecute it as quick as they could, and that he had given a Plenary Indulgence of 10000 years for all those that should Act either in Person or Estate for killing the King, and setting up the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion in <hi>England,</hi> besides a Pardon and other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. And so much As to the Plot in general. Now, my Lord, I come to the particulars as to the Prisoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne.</hi> About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1676. much about that time, there was Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> and his Son, my Lady <hi>Tempest,</hi> and <hi>Rushton</hi> the Priest together, where I heard them hold several Discourses of this Design about killing the King, and firing the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> did declare and assure Mr. <hi>Rushton,</hi> that he would not swerve from what he had said, but would keep to the Oath of Secrecy he had given him, and that he would do to the uttermost of his Power for the killing the King, and the Establishment of Popery.</p>

               <p>They did not know I was there. And they did unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously conclude, that it was a meritorious Undertaking, and for the good of the Church, and they would all venture their Lives and Estates in it.</p>

               <p>Yes, <hi>Rushton</hi> was there: and Dr. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> a Priest, coming from another Door, and finding me at the door, went in and desired them to speak lower, for there was one at the door.

               <p>My Lord, I was not in a condition to make any Friends, or come up to <hi>London</hi> upon such an account; besides, my Lord, they did threaten me; and particularly after the Plot was come out, <hi>Addison</hi> did threaten me.</p>

               <p>My Lord, under Favour, I do take it, that the debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men in point of Conscience, that they may not take the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance is to set them loose from the Government, and loose from the King,

                        <p>LOnger time having pass'd since your last writing, it is fit to inform you how Gods holy Providence disposes concerning us. All the Out-prisoners being call'd into the Castle, (as you may have heard) Mrs. <hi>Hastings</hi> Room was needed, and so she went into <hi>Castle-gate</hi> to reside at the former lodging of one <hi>Mrs. Wait,</hi> (who is now in the Jayl) where she remains with Mrs. <hi>Wait's</hi> two children, and their Maid-servant, teaching the children, as formerly; also the <hi>Moor'</hi>s Neece goes daily thither; and Mrs. <hi>Hastings</hi> lives without charge as to Diet and Lodging, as I formerly told you; she spends all her time well, God be praised, and comes every morning about seven a clock to serve God at the Castle: but I and two others are much abridg'd of that happiness by her Room being left by her here. My liberty of going abroad is restrain'd with the rest, none being as yet permitted the least, since these last were forced to come in. Madam was here the other day, and seem'd somewhat timorous about Mrs. <hi>Hastings</hi> teaching: but most in the Castle perswaded her, that it was most commendable and most secure, and so she rests satisfied: Mrs. <hi>Cornwallis</hi> is recovered of her Ague, God be blest: she desires her dutiful respects may be alwayes presented unto you, and intends her self to write to you. Mrs. <hi>Wood</hi> and her Companion are well, but dare not as yet walk in their own Garden. All our now Prisoners are chearful, and each of us comforted, in hopes that God will make all Catholicks of one mind: for I have a Letter from our <note n="*" place="inline">Mr. Record. That is Superior.</note> 
                           <hi>Spr.</hi> at <hi>London</hi> (who was the same day taken and carried to Prison) wherein he declares, alledging Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>That the pretended Oath of Allegiance cannot be taken, as it is worded, adding, that three Brieves have formerly been sent from the Pope, expresly prohibiting it; and in the third, it is declared damnable to take it.</hi> And ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday <hi>we had a Letter communicated amongst us, sent by Mr.</hi> Middleton <hi>(now at Paris) to his Friends here, containing the attestation of all the</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon <hi>Doctors against it; adding, that whosoever here in</hi> England <hi>give leave, they deceive People, and are contrary to the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>About Spring last Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoine</hi> was consulting with me about Money <hi>Bolron</hi> owed him upon two Bonds, and gave me Directions to sue them.

               <p>The one is for Twenty eight pounds, the other Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the best of my remembrance. Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> having notice of this, did desire he would accept of a Conveyance of an House he had at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi> for satisfaction of his Debt. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was unwilling to accept of it, but I did prevail with him to accept it, not in Satisfaction, but as an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Security; and the Deeds I have here that I drew for that end.</p>

               <p>That was the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> as I remember, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Declaration; and that day before, which was the 13<hi>th</hi> to the best of my remembrance, I had this Communication and discourse about Sealing the Writings, which the Wife refused to joyn in; but <hi>Sir Thomas</hi> would only take it as an additional Security, refusing to deliver up the Bonds, but he would suspend further prosecution, and <hi>Bolron</hi> did then desire no longer time then a month for payment of the Money.

I told him I did believe it would be no hard matter to perswade Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to that, for he would be very glad of it. I went up with him to <hi>Barmbow,</hi> and as we went along, he asked me if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did intend to sue him upon his Bond? I told him I had directions so to do. He asked me likewise if he would turn him out of his Farm? I told him, Yes, if he would not pay his Rent; and the truth of it is, he did then deny he had received the Declaration in Ejectment: but my Man afterwards made his <hi>Affidavit</hi> of delivery, and had Judgment upon it. Afterwards I went up to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and told him what <hi>Bolron</hi> desired, and he consented to it as readily as it could be asked; and in coming away he told <hi>Bolron,</hi> that in the management of his Coalpits he did neglect very much, and did go abroad, staying away two or three days together. To this <hi>Bolron</hi> made some excuse, and said it was for collecting his Debts. Said Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> I know not what you are about, but if you do well for your self, I am satisfied.</p>

I cannot tell, but this was a little before he came to <hi>London,</hi> which I judge to be the latter end of <hi>June;</hi> and this is all I have to say.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60716:22"/>Then <hi>Obadiah Moor</hi> was called.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Did you tell Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> what he said, Then I will do what I never did intend to do.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Babbington.</speaker>
               <p>I did never tell him my Lord, for I look'd upon it as an idle expression. And I will tell your Lordship why; because this Man that is now to be examined did tell me how that he was bound for him, and that <hi>Bolron</hi> to incourage him to be bound, said, You need not fear, for if Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> sues me, I will inform against him for keeping Priests in his House; and I did look upon it as an idle expression.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Moor.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, in <hi>September</hi> last was 12 Month, <hi>Mr. Bolron</hi> did desire me to be bound with him to Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyn.</hi> Said I, I told him, <hi>Mr. Bolron,</hi> I have some small Acquaintance with you, but I have no reason to be bound with you. Said he, Do not fear; there is my Brother <hi>Baker,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Thompson</hi> are to be bound as well as you. Said he, I will give you my Counter-security. That signifies nothing, said I. You need not fear any Suits, said he; for if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> sues me, I will inform against him for keeping Priests. Said he, When must this Money be paid? Said he, at <hi>Candlemas</hi> next. So we went and were bound; the one Bond was to be paid at <hi>Candlemas</hi> last, and the other in <hi>August.</hi> And after <hi>Candlemas</hi> he did not pay the Money, and said I, Mr. <hi>Bolron,</hi> I don't like these Bonds, you must make new Bonds for my security. I was afraid of being sued, and I desired Mr. <hi>Babbington</hi> to bring a Writ against him, which he did; and upon <hi>Holy-Thursday</hi> I had two Bayliffs ready to arrest him, but he could not be found; and I had two likewise the <hi>Saturday</hi> before at his Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s. Presently after he came up to <hi>London,</hi> and made an Information, and on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> last I met him in <hi>Ferry Bridg,</hi> and he came along with me; said he, <hi>Mr. Moor,</hi> you and I have often discoursed of Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyn,</hi> you may do me good, if you do not, pray do me no harm. You have been often at his House. With that, I asked him if he was concerned in the Plot? for, said I, you have been often telling me, and sworn it, and deny'd it utterly, that he was no more concerned than any body else: but I did but equivocate then, for I was a Papist, and if I had told a 1000 Lies, or killed 20 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, our Priest would have forgiven me for it. And so coming to <hi>Farnborn,</hi> two Miles from <hi>Ferry-Bridge,</hi> he plucked out 10 <hi>s.</hi> and said, I have no more Mony in my Pocket but this, but pray be kind and do me no harm, for you know I have deni'd it all along.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Moor.</speaker>

               <p>The latter end of <hi>September</hi> was 12 Month, when the Plot ws first discovered. And he said, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was no more concerned than the Child that was to be born.</p>

               <p>I can't certainly remember, but I think it was in <hi>February,</hi> when I told him I would sue the Bond, or have better security. It was a small time after <hi>Candlemas.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Thompson.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if you will give me leave to speak, I know a great deal of the Unkindness betwixt Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Mr. Bolron.</hi> He came down to me, he was Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne's</hi> Steward of his Coleary, and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> liked not of his Accompts, and turned him forth. There was a great deal of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny owing to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and he came to Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to agree about it, and he desired me to be bound with him to Sir <hi>Thomas:</hi> Said I, <hi>Mr. Bolron,</hi> how shall I be secured? Said he, there is a great deal of Money of which I never gave Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> any accompt, I will gather it in and secure all, and so Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> knew nothing of it. So Bonds for 60 <hi>l.</hi> were entred into to pay 28 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Candlemas.</hi> So Sir, when <hi>Candlemas</hi> came, and he did not pay the Money, I went up to him, and asked him what he would do about this Money, what course he would take to satisfy? Oh! never fear, said he; why said I, hath he any hand in the Plot? if he hath let us know it; for he had made a great deal of his Goods away, and then I thought I should not be secured, Oh said he, he is a sin less of it.</p>

               <p>Candlemas last.

Then it passed on, and having a Writ out against me, I durst not stir out my self, but I did send my Man to him to know what he did intend to do about it. He told my Man, Brother, tell thy Master he need not to fear at all; why said my Man, do you know he hath any hand in the Plot?—</p>

               <p>Yes, the day after <hi>Ascension-day:</hi> He came to my House about two a Clock in the afternoon, and staid at my House all that afternoon while an hour after Sun set before he went away.

               <p>He came and brought a Letter to me that was to goto <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi> and desired me, that my little Boy might carry it to a kinsmans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> house of mine, for he said, he was afraid of the Bailiff, and did not care for stirring out.

               <p>The night before I met him coming from the Race, which was the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> and he asked me if I saw any Bayliffs waiting for him? and I said, Yes. And he said it was well if he missed them. And he asked me if I saw <hi>Bennet Johnson?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bolron.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there is not a word of it true: for I was about two a clock at Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyns.</hi> They were marking some Sheep, and I was there most of the Afternoon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Just. Jones.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Were you ever at his House at any other time to send any such Letter?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Balron.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I never sent any such Letter. Indeed that day I was a little of the afternoon at his House, but I staid there but half an hour; but I was most part of the afternoon at Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoin</hi>'s seeing them mark Sheep.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then <hi>Roger Gregson</hi> was called.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Just. Jones.</hi>
               </speaker>

               <speaker>Sir Tho. Gascoin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </speaker>
               <p>Let him speak his knowledge.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Serj. Maynard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I desire he may ask the Question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he only ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally refers to them what they know.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Thomas Gascoyne.</speaker>
               <p>What did he say to you about <hi>August</hi> last?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gregson.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord I will tell you, we met about <hi>August</hi> last, <hi>Robert Bolron</hi> and I, about a week before Bartholomew day. We had some discourse, he came from <hi>London</hi> a little before that, and I asked him how Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyn</hi> did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gregson.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he was in the Tower. He said, Well. I asked him, how he would come off about the Plot (as they call it)? Said he, he may come off well enough, but it will cost him a great deal of Money. I then did ask, how they came to fall out? And he said it was long of that Rogue <hi>Addison,</hi> Brother to the Priest, who had called him to accompt, or else he had never done Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> that injury. And I suppose that was the cause of it. And then we had some more discourse, and that Discourse was this, he rides a little from me (he was on Horse-back) and came back again, said he, I can tell you, the King was at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and one of the Privy Council made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to stab the King, and the King made his escape, and now they will believe my Informations the better.</p>

To which <hi>Mr. Mowbray</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered again, How shall we bring this business about? If thou wilt but come to my house, said he, I will put thee in a way to contrive it, and we shall have a considerable Reward. And <hi>Mowbray</hi> told him he would come to him such a day.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Batley.</speaker>
               <p>They said they came out of <hi>Leeds,</hi> and said, one Mr. <hi>Legat</hi> was to come that way, who they were to speak with.</p>

               <speaker>Batley.</speaker>

               <p>When the Commissioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> were sitting at <hi>Leeds,</hi> there was one came and told me, <hi>George Dixon</hi> could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me something that would be very advantageous for the benefit of Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyn.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Batley.</speaker>
               <p>No, I spoke it to a Smith, one <hi>Richard Loftus.</hi>

               <p>I'le tell you another Person I heard it from, that was Mr. <hi>Bayliff</hi> of <hi>Leeds.</hi>

               <p>He says so. Was it then presently?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Babbington.</speaker>
               <p>The Bayliff did not tell me so suddenly.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>Would it not have been to your purpose to have brought the Bayliff here?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Babbington.</speaker>
               <p>It was after the Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> that I had it from him, which was in <hi>October.</hi>

               <p>In the time of <hi>August</hi> I was not at <hi>Leeds,</hi> I was in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> searching for Priests, and in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> all but a little of the first of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jefferson.</speaker>
               <p>I asked Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> one time, what he knew concerning Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne?</hi> And he said, he knew nothing, but Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was a very honest Gentleman for what he knew, and the best Friend he had.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Just. Pemberton.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. Pebles.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I was in <hi>York</hi> last Assizes, and <hi>Mr. Bolron</hi> came to me into a Room, where I was with some Gentlemen, and asked me how I did? and asked me if I did not know him? I told him I did not remember him; said he, I am the the prosecutor against Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne.</hi> So when he was sat down, after a little while, he desired to discourse with me, and asked me if a man was indicted as a Traytor whether it were fit to pay him Money? I owe, said he, Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> Money, and I would know whether it be fit to pay it to him? said I, I think you may safely pay him his Money before he be convicted, but then 'tis the King's in my opinion. Nay, said <hi>Bol.</hi> he is sure to be convicted. Thensaid I, I think it not safe to pay it therefore I leave that to your own Discretion whether you will or no. Alit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after he desired to have my Opinion concerning the two Judges that came our Circuit, for I am might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ly abused by them, said he, they will not at all give me Audience; I came from the King and Council, and they slight me, will not hear me speak. Said I, I believe if you will go to them, they will hear you. I went to speak with them, and they sent some of their Servants out to know what I would say to them; but I have wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> a Letter to them, to tell them my mind, but said I, I can't believe, that any one will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to carry such a Letter, but for that I will leave it to you. So I came away from him, and after he follows me out, and desires to speak with me again; said he, I have something against you concerning this business in hand, I can do you a prejudice if I will. Said I, God bless me, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, I do not at all intend to court your Favour, I have no mind at all to that. Said he, I will not do it; and he spoke as if he had no desire to do it; I would not court him, but came away and left him; he followed me to the Street again, and said, Will you help to apprehend a Traytor? who is it? said I: It is a Gentlewoman, said he, a Woman greatly concerned in the Plot, you may apprehend her in the Street, and 'tis the best time. Now the Street was full, and I thought it a little unseasonable: so he looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, but I never offered to go from him; but said I, was she in the Plot? yes, said he, she was to be the first Lady <hi>Mayoress</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>York</hi> after the Plot took effect, and the King was killed; but he did not lay hold upon her. So I parted with her, then said he, I can have no respect; said I, I have nothing to do with you, I am Clerk of the Peace of the <hi>West Riding</hi> in this County, and am always ready to do my Duty there. So away I went and left him. The next news I heard, was, he had procured a Warrant of the Council against me, and he brings the Warrant to a Justice of Peace, and that Justice of Peace told him there would be several Justices of Peace at <hi>Leeds</hi> within two or three days after, and then they would examine the Business; I chanced to be in a Room with some Gentlemen, not knowing of the Warrant that was out against me, and this Gentleman that was the Justice of Peace called me into another Room, and told me of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: admired at it, and told him I did know nothing of it, nor that I had disobliged him, unless it was because I did not give him the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60716:28"/>
and Ceremony of my Hat, nor give him Money, neither did I know what Information he had procured that Warrant upon. He told me Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Mr. Bolron</hi> were in Town. So I desired him to send for the other Justices into the Room, where he acquainted them with the matter, and said he, if you will, we will examine it to night; so they sent notice to <hi>Mr. Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Mr. Bolron,</hi> that they would examine the Business that night at 6 a clock, and they came, and he was asked what he had to say against me? He said, I had taken Money for keeping a Man from taking the Oath of Allegience, and they had Witnesses to prove it.—</p>

               <p>Did he say he did not speak with the Judges?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bolron.</hi>

               <p>No my Lord I did not.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>You did speak with us, indeed you would have had us allowed you a Guard for your safety, which we could not do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bolron.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Whereas he says I gave in a wrong Information, this same <hi>Hunt</hi> when he came before them confessed he gave him 40 <hi>s.</hi> but he would not swear for what it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Serg. Maynard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>'Tis nothing to the purpose one thing or other that he hath said.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Just. Dolben.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>'Tis altogether uncertain; no body knows what to make of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then Hardwicke was called.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sr. <hi>Tho. Gascoyne.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Do you speak what Threats <hi>Bolron</hi> hath used to his Wife to swear against me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hardwicke.</speaker>
               <p>When the Pursivants came up to <hi>Barmbow,</hi> the Chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable ordered me to assist Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> in Execution of the Warrant, and to carry the Witnesses before a Justice. We went to <hi>Robert Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s house to take the Witnesses, and there was his Wife, his Brother, and his Sister. We were to carry them before a Justice and they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to go, his Wife pretended to be Sick and could not go, and they begg'd of us to excuse them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>Who do you call they?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hardwicke.</speaker>
               <p>His Wife, his Brother and his Sister: <hi>Bolron</hi> told them they must go, and <hi>William Backhouse</hi> and I ordered them by all means to go along with us, I suppose it was to Testifie what he had sworn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>What were they to do, did he tell them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hardwicke.</speaker>
               <p>They were to go to tell what his Testimony was above, as well as I understood the discourse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>We have had two persons to this purpose before. They say he would have his Wife go, and she refused to go, and cryed; but they do neither of them say he pressed her to speak anything more than she knew or against her knowledge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Pemberton.</speaker>
               <p>No, one of the Witnesses said, he told her it was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </sp>
            <p>Then William Clow was Examined.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>Come what say you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clow.</speaker>
               <p>The 22<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last I had a Writ against <hi>Bolron,</hi> and my man Arrested him and brought him to my house.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>At whose suit?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clow.</speaker>
               <p>At the suit of one <hi>Hickringil</hi> that was servant to Sir <hi>Thoma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and there I had him two days and would not carry him to the Gaol, for he begged of me I would not; but then I told him I would keep him no longer there, for he had no money for Lodging and Dyet; but he begged so hard of me, that I would but tarry till <hi>Hickringill</hi> came, and then he did not care what they did with him: for he would make Sir

                  <hi>Thomas</hi> pay <hi>Hickringill</hi> his Debt that he owed him, or he would play him such a trick as he little dream'd of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>
               <p>When was this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clow.</speaker>
               <p>The 21<hi>th.</hi> or 22<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last or thereabouts.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clow.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. And so <hi>Hickringill</hi> came over, and they did agree, and he gave him a Lease of an house he lived in, and <hi>Hickringill</hi> took the Charge of both the Debts upon him.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then Hobart stood up.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord to conclude I desire to speak a word. On the one side here is an Ancient Gentlemans life in question, and that or his death are to be the issue of this Cause; on the other side here is the discovery of a Plot upon which all our lives, our Religion, and the life of our King depend. It did require your patience, and you have yielded it. Where lyes the Question? If these Witnesses that have been Examined be believed, there is no Question but he is highly Guilty of the Plot: the Witness tells you, When there was no talk of the Plot, there was a preparation of a false and fraudulent Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be drawn by advice of Counsel, and why was this made? lest
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60716:31"/>
he should for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>it his Estate. This is proved in the beginning. You find next a meeting of the Priests, and there what they did, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this Gentleman at the Bar till he took notice of it, and then joyned in it, and approved of it, and did declare it was a Worthy Plot, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Plot for the good of the Church, and at last particularly he would give 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Bolron</hi> to destroy the King and murder him. The t'other Witness agrees with him, and what is said against all this? They have called and examined I think 19 or 20 Witnesses, three touching the threatning of his Wife, but that salls out to be nothing; two Ale-house-keepers that stood at the bottom of the Stairs and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard their discourse; but you have all heard how they contradicted one another, they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not agreed well enough together on their story. All that the rest do is meant thus, and so far they make something of it, that there should be a Debt due from this <hi>Bolron</hi> to this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and so it were some contrivance as if he would do it by way of Revenge; it does fall out many times that men do quarrel, but this is a business of anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Nature. They say that he should threaten he would serve him a Trick, or there were some such words; but under favour, the question is of the truth of his testimony; now it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they knew what his Testimony would be, and there is nothing against the other Witness that concurrs with him, but the fellows that were upon the stairs, that talk one of one part of the stairs and the other of the other. The matter is clearly whethe rthe witnesses be to be believed, or whether there be any thing sufficient offered to take off their Testimony. You will be pleased to observe as to what was spoken about the money and the Nunnery, we brought you a Letter from the Priest who was mentioned to be one of them at the meeting <hi>Pracid,</hi> that writes and dates his Letter from the place the Witness speaks of, and there you will observe that in one of the Letters'tis expressed <hi>If England be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> (there is the main of the Plot) for all I suppose goes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, pray who thought of <hi>England</hi>'s Conversion at that time? What led them into that but a Consciousness of a design to convert <hi>England?</hi> My Lord, another piece of a Letter there is concerning the Oath of Allegiance, you have heard it read, and every body knows what the meaning of it is, it is the Engine of the Jesuites that if they can but draw men off from their fidelity to the King, whereof there is no Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony so great as the Oath of Allegiance, they need not use so much of Eqaivocation; but that is an abominable thing, and not to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go take off the strength of that Oath that hath been taken by men more honest than the rest, and not suffering the rest to take it at all: and it is a damnable thing that they should assert the King is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and the Pope has deposed him, therefore it is meritorious to kill him: but you have heard the Evidence fully, and it needs no ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think the Evidence hath been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by Mr. Serg. <hi>Maynard,</hi> and my Lord, I think there is nothing in this Case, but only the Credit of the Witnesses, for if they be to be believed, there is an Evidence as full as can be. I know your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships observes how it is introduced, how they are fortified in some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did at first deny. They tell you that he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60716:31"/>
had a pious intent to found a Nunnery, and did proceed so far as to make a settlement, this was denyed by Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne,</hi> but hath been verified, and made out by his own Books and Letters writ to him, which were found in his own Custody. This did Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> do with an Expectation of a sudden Change, for the Letters do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that <hi>England</hi> was to be converted as they called it, and therefore they had settled their matters in order, and they thought fit to insert that Proviso in the settlement, That if <hi>England</hi> should be converted then, the money was to be disposed so and so. But your Lordship likewise observes, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, what other correspondence Sir <hi>T. Gascoyne</hi> had with one <hi>Cornwallis</hi> or <hi>Pracid</hi> a Priest. He receives a Letter which shews you what the Principles of all the Catholicks are, how far they have proceeded to take away even the Oath of Allegiance, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of that how far it will go, when they think themselves obliged in Conscience to cast off Fidelity to their Prince, and what mischiefs may ensue no man knows, but we may in part imagine. You have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had sufficient discovery to make out the use of this instilled Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and that is the design to kill the King, for this you hear what the Evidence say. Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of them is sent to the Priest to be instructed by him; and by him was chid for offering to go against their Principles to take the Oath, and told him he was damn'd for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And presently after he was Examined by Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some discourse with him what <hi>Rushton</hi> had said, who had moved him likewise to kill the King as he says. Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> knew to what purpose he sent him thither, not only to renounce the Oath of Allegiance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to carry on the design which he had in hand, and did introduce by laying aside the Oath, and tells him he must engage in the design to kill the King. He examines him what the other had spoke to him of, and he said he knew it was more than bare chiding of him for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Oath of Allegiance, and he told him for his better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go on, that if he would undertake he should have 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and this is the sum of <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Evidence as to Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne.</hi> What then says <hi>Mowbray</hi> the second Witness, he was so faithful a servant and so diligent, that he was imployed by <hi>Rushton</hi> the Confessor to attend him at the Altar, and be in service immediate about him, and he being by that means so dear to him waited upon him in his Chamber, and was privy to all the Consultations held there. And he gives you an accompt how long this Plot hath been in Agitation, for they had been discoursing a good while of it; and resolved it should be done if not by fair means, by foul, and tells you plainly by killing the King. And that he heard Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> himself declare that it was a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Act to kill the King, and that as before he had the Oath of Secrecy given him by <hi>Rushton,</hi> so he did declare (which <hi>Mowbray</hi> standing at the Door heard) that he would never swerve from the Oath, but he would assist to the utmost of his power, and they that were with him said they would stand by it with their Lives and fortunes; and when my Lady <hi>Tempest</hi> understood he was there and was iealous of him, she bid him go down and entertain the Guests below stairs. So here is an Evidence from two Witnesses as full as can be in any Case, that Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> was privy to the Conspiracy, and himself a partaker of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60716:32"/>
it to kill the King. All that hath been said against them is to vilifie their Reputation. As to <hi>Mowbray</hi> I hear but little, onlythere are two Witnesses that touch him, and indeed if these Winesses were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, they say a great deal, that is, they were in an Alehouse together and heard them conspire to take awaythe Life of Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne.</hi> Indeed <hi>Mowbray</hi> said, for Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne</hi> I know nothing but that he is a very honest Gentleman, but for my Lady <hi>Tempest</hi> if I could hang her I would. That they should hear them contrive this together and conspire how they should take away the Lives of this Gentleman and the others. Indeed if these men say true 'tis a great matter to take off the credit of their Testimony, but you heard Gentlemen how they did vary: For the one said as I apprehended at first he was in the Room, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was below stairs. Ask the one could you hear them? Yes, could you see them? No; said the other, yes. So that they were not well provided as to that matter, nor had they consulted that point well where they should agree to stand to overhear the matter. Now if that be likely they should in the presence of two persons whom they did not know, and one of them they never saw, but in the Court, declare and discourse of such a matter as this for the taking away the life of Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> then we have nothing to say to them, we must leave the credit of that to you, you will observe their variety in the story, and the improbability of the thing. But then for Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against him is, that he is a very dishonest man, and that this is all out of malice to Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> because he would sue him upon his Bonds. You observe how he does behave himself under that prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, all that he hath he is willing to part with for payment of his Debt, he makes over his Estate for satisfaction and security, and does as much as an honest man can do: all he hath shall lie at stake, and as for Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> himself he had no such Opinion of him in poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of dishonesty, for he declared he lived in his service without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and said before the Council he knew nothing of dishonesty by him, but only this Information, and now he found him to be (what he always thought) a great fool. Now whether he thought him a fool for telling this story or what else, you may explain the meaning of his Expression. But as for any thing of dishonesty there is nothing against Mr. <hi>Bolron.</hi> He was in Debt 'tis true, but what he had lay at stake for the payment of it, and as far as it would go Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> might take it; but that for malice he should come to swear against him, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing clearly made out. One Witness says indeed, that he should say, Does Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> intend to sue me, then I will do what I did not intend to; do whether that be a speech of malice or no, or rather does confirm the truth of his Evidence, is left to your Consideration. It shews rather there was something that he had in his power to do before any prosecution from Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne,</hi> or any occasion of his malice against him: It hath not the necessary import of a malicious speech, that he did intend not to do such a thing, and because he was sued did do it; that therefore is only malice and no truth. For the other matter that is said against him, that he should endeavour to suborn his Wife to swear falsly, that was by no means fully proved; but rather that matter hath been sufficiently cleared, that though she said she knew nothing, yet he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60716:32"/>
would have her go, though she said nothing, and you hear what the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath been for Mr. <hi>Bolron,</hi> that he never did press her to swear falsly, nor threaten her if she would not, but only desired her to declare her knowledge if she knew anything<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the truth and nothing but the truth. These are all the Objections made against the credit of the Witnesses, and I think if their credit do stand you cannot have a clearer. Evidence to convict any one than hath been given you to day, but that we leave to you; and submit these Objections whether they have any weight in them, and whether they have not been fully answered.</p>

There have been produced on the behalf of the King two Witnesses Mr. <hi>Bolron,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> both of them servants to Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> the Prisoner, and therefore might very possibly and probably enough be privy to all they have said, andtesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this case. It does appear by them both, that Sir <hi>Thomas Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne</hi> was a very early man in the Plot (if they say true) We heard nothing of it till the long Vacation (78) but it seems Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> was a Plotter and Conspirator in the year (75) or (76) And that he might be able to do this somewhat more safely, he contrives how he might convey away his Estate to prevent the forfeiture, and he makes an Assurance of it to Sir <hi>William Ingleby</hi> colourably as the Witnesses swear for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> And it does appear likewise as to the Introduction of the Popish Religion here, they began to settle a Nunnery, and it was fit to do so against <hi>England</hi> should be converted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First in such a place, but if it happened <hi>England</hi> were converted, then to be removed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place. There was at this Nunnery appointed an Abbess, an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant and several Nuns, and Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> so well knew of this, that one of them that was appointed to be a Nun at the time of her taking Horse, he said to her, there goes an old maid and a young Nun. And there are Letters come from that very Nunnery and from the Priest that was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attend them as Confessor, which have been read to you; and there is another preparation thought necessary to introduce this Plot, and that is, that all Papists might be seduced into an Opinion that it was a dangerous thing to take the Oath of Allegiance, and that it was a dam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For this purpose Letters came from the Doctors at <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> and they determine it to be so, lest any man of that Religion should be so good a Subject as to profess Obedience to the King in Temporals. Then the Plot goes on between Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hungate,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Vavaser,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gascoyne, Middleton, Rushton,</hi> my Lady <hi>Tempest,</hi> and a great Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, all met together and consulting in Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi>'s house in his great Room, his old Dining Room to this purpose, not only to bring in their Religion but kill the King expresly (so says
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60716:33"/>
the Witness) I think they had often talked of it before the Witness in the Priests Chamber, for he being then a Papist was privy to his Masters design and the rest of the Confederates for killing the King, which was the only thing they desired to effect, as the best way to bring in their Religion: and there was great reason to do it they said too; for the King had not kept his word with them when he was in his Exile, for they said he had promised if he was restored to his Kingdoms he would restore the Pepish Religion, but now he was returned and had broke his promise; and nothing more was to be done, the Pope having declared him an Heretick, but to destroy him, and this was that which was agreed among them. The 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diverse other Consults had about it the Priest <hi>Rushton</hi> being at Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoynes</hi> house, <hi>Bolron</hi> is desired to go into the Gallery, and there presently comes in <hi>Rushton</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Priest, <hi>Bolron</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him that he had been at the Sessions and taken the Oath of Allegiance; assoon as ever he heard it, he cries out he had committed a damnable sin, he must of necessity renounce it, and repent of it; and he could give him a Pardon, for he had an extraordinary power, more authority than others, he could give him Absolution if he did repent of it, and that no Catholick must by any means take the Oath. A while after they had a discourse concerning killing the King; and the Witness says indeed he was not act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He tells you of the discourse and consultation the Priests had in the house, and that it was expresly and precisely for killing the King. He tells you that he did stand at the Door and heard it as I observed before, and he tells you too which hath not been observed that at that time there was produced a List of 4 or 500 Persons that had engaged in the design of killing the King, he did see the List; he did lee Sir <hi>Thomas Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coynes</hi> hand which he very well knew and was acquainted with, and which might very well be, being his servant: So that here is not only a discourse and agreement by parol that he should be in the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, but if you believe him, he says, that here is actually the hand of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to the engagement to do the Villany, and truly they that were of that perswasion at that time might easily be induced to it. For it was agreed amongst them, that they should have a plenary
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60716:33"/>
Indulgence of 10000 years, and it was a meritorious Act, and though Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> perhaps was not so ready to contribute in all things, yet hearing of the meritoriousness of the act, and withal that he should be canonized for a Saint for this piece of piety, he certainly might readily consent to it. Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> indeed was asked, why he did not discover it sooner? he tells you why, he was in fear of the Papists, he was threatned, and very like he might be possessed with fear, and so might a man of greater Constancy till the business was discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore he did not talk of it in the Country, but came up here where it was more safe to discover it, and hath been here ever since: Besides this Testimony of these Witnesses, Gentlemen, there are some Papers produced; some that mention money that hath been conveyed by Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> in confirmation of the Testimony of <hi>Bolron</hi> the first Witness, who does swear that he heard Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> say he would send 3000 <hi>l.</hi> to the <hi>Jesuites</hi> to go on and prosecute this Plot; and afterwards he did hear him say he had sent the 3000 <hi>l.</hi> that he had promised. Now it does appear by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s Almanack that he had sent several sums, his Receiver <hi>Phiswick</hi> did speak of 6000 <hi>l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and he himself did give a touch towards it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Phiswick</hi> was a Receiver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Evidence for the King against the Prisoner is but two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, but they as positive and express as possibly can be. What then is said by the Prisoner or the Witnesses in his defence? There is one that is <hi>Shippon</hi> that gives some Testimony against the very Evidence and the possibility of it to be true in one part of it; for <hi>Bolron</hi> he tells you that the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> was the time, when there was that Consult held at Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoynes</hi> in the Gallery with the Priest, that he staid there till night, and that then Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> talked with him and made this proffer to him for the murder and destruction of the King. Here comes a Witness <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ippon</hi> and tells you that that very 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May Bolron</hi> was at his house at 2 a Clock and staid an hour or two after Sunset; if that weretrue that he were there all that time, it is not then true that he speaks of about Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> and it was impossible that he should be at the Consult at that time when he says he was there, and afterwards spoke to Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne.</hi> Now Gentlemen you have the Kings Witness upon his Oath, he that Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies against him is barely upon his word, and he is a Papist too, for that he was asked, and he did confess himself so. I do not say that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60716:34"/>
a Papist is no Witness, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>a Papist is a Witness, and he is a Witness in a Papist Cause, and for a Papist; but I must tell you, there is less credit to be given to a Papist in a Cause of this nature, who easily can believe they may have Indulgences and Pardons enough for saving one from the Gallows who is to be Canonized for a Saint if the Plot take effect. He hath only affirmed it who is a Papist, the other who is a Protestant swears what his Evidence is.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Babbington</hi> who was the first Witness examined for the Prisoner, he tells you there had been some debates and differences about Rent and money that was owing by <hi>Bolron</hi> to the Prisoner. He laboured and interceded often on his behalf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>but at length not being able to prevail that he should not be sued; the Witness swears, I will then do that which I did not intend to do. What he meant by it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and it is an ambiguous Speech, but to interpret it that he would swear falsly to take away a mans life, and so commit both Murder and Perjury, is hard to infer and conclude from such doubtful Words. There are some Witnesses that tell you, that is, <hi>Moor,</hi> and others, that <hi>Bolron</hi> did say and swear that Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gascoyne</hi> was never concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d in the Plot: that might very well be, especially if you take the time when he did say this, he was a Papist a great while after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had ingaged himself in the Plot, and while he was so, it is not unlike he would venture an Oath to save any of the same Perswasion and Religion he himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was of. But whatsoever he said it was not Judicially, he was not bound to discover to him he spoke to, he is now upon his Oath, and you have heard what an express testimony he gives. As to what is said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife, that he should endeavour to perswade her contrary to her knowledge to give testimony against Sir <hi>Tho. Gascoyne,</hi> and therefore he is not to be believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here upon his own Oath, who would have his Wife forswear herself to fortifie him: There is no such thing, and it does appear by the Evidence of those that are sworn, that he was earnest, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Gascoyne,</hi> but <hi>Mowbray</hi> at that time said he knew nothing of Sir <hi>Tho.

               <p>I should be very loth to omit any thing on the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses side, or that hath been materially testified against them on the Prisoners. I did not conceive the Evidence given by Mr. <hi>Pebles</hi> to come to any thing at all. There was a discourse between <hi>Bolron</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60716:34"/>
him at last Assizes, after some talk <hi>Bolron</hi> tells him he had something to say to him, and what was it, <hi>Bolron</hi> was told that he had charged some persons that he ought not to do, (excused them for money that did not take the Oath of Allegiance as they ought to have done) and it seems he did it hear, and so far he went as to bring Witnesses before the Justices of Peace to prove it. And although they did not give Evidence against Mr. <hi>Pebles</hi> in that very particular, yet certainly he thought they would have said something, but that does not argue at all, that because he did accuse Mr. <hi>Pebles</hi> (as he thought justly in that particular) therefore that now he should falsly accuse Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> in a matter that concerns his Life so highly. There are some other things that were said by the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that would tend towards the proving of some malice in the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses towards Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> and therefore they give in this Evidence: One thing indeed was spoken by <hi>Hickringill,</hi> that is, it was generally reported in the Country that <hi>Mowbray</hi> had taken away money from Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne,</hi> and that <hi>Mowbray</hi> himself said, that as they had endeavoured to take away his Fame and Life, now he had found an Opportunity to requite them. So saith the Witness, but 'tis not very probable. I leave it with you upon the credit of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for the King, who have sworn it upon their Oaths, and the others that go upon their Words, and not their Oaths, whether they have taken away the force and strength of the Kings Evidence which is as sull, express and positive as can be by two Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, here is on the one side the life of an ancient Gentleman before you, on the other side there is a Conspiracy against the Life of the King, who is the breath of our Nostrils, and whom God long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. I know you being upon your Oaths will take into your Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations both, and give a Verdict according to the Evidence you have heard.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I will tell you Gentlemen, I cannot forbear say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one thing to you. There is some Evidence that makes it a very improbable thing to be true what Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> hath said, and yet Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> having said it so positively, and <hi>Mowbray</hi> agreeing with it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babillties must give way to positive proofs. I saw you did observe it when it was mentioned, and 'tis true, to me it seems improbable that at the very same time that Sir <hi>Thomas Gascoyne</hi> should sue him upon his Bond, and take a Course to turn him out of his house, that he should then be privy to such a Conspiracy; 'tis improbable either that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> should offer him such a sum of money to kill the King, or if he had, that he should afterwards take that Course at Law against him. Now for that I say this to you, you are to give a Verdict accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Evidence. They have such secret Contrivances amongst themselves (and he was a Papist at that time) that where there are two men that positively tell you a thing that lies within their own knowledge, and swear it is true, it is scarce any improbability that should weigh against such an Evidence.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Just. Pemberton.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>And Gentlemen consider withal as to that, for truly my Brother <hi>Dolben</hi> hath rightly minded you of that improbability, for it was no more: but then you must consider all the Circumstances. 'Tis indeed at the first blush improbable that a man would communicate so

great a secret to another, if he did intend to sue him for money he owed him, but then 'tis likewise as improbable that he would provoke him by a suit if his life were in his hand; but consider the delivering of the Lease of Ejectment, and those things were the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Babbington.</speaker>
               <p>I had direction long before I did it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Just. Pemberton</speaker>
               <p>They threatned him the 2, but they did not do it. But look you Gentlemen consider this, I do not doubt but Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gascoyne</hi> was sure that this man durst not discover any thing of this, for they had given him the Sacrament and an Oath of secrecy, which they look upon as a tye among themselves as long as they continue in that Religion, not upon any accompt whatsoever to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and they have such Confidence in it that they will trust their Lives and every thing in a man's hand when they have given him that Oath. Alas how could these people have the Confidence to Plot one with another as they do, when they know their lives are in the hands of any one of all the rest, but upon this Accompt? Do but swear them unto secrecy and give them the Sacrament of the <hi>Mass</hi> upon it, and then they think such a one is proof enough against anything in the world, for that is damnation if they break it, as their Priests tell them, but I doubt not but Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> thought he had them as fast as can be upon that L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ck. But as to Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Evidence of those 2 men at <hi>Leeds,</hi> this is after the accusation of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> that they speak of, and can any man alive believe that they would go and Plot to contrive the death of these 2 persons in the face of 2 strangers, after he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused? 'Tis so strange an Evidence that no man alive can believe it to be truth. Look you Gentlemen, Persons that go to contrive such things as these are, go in secret, and hope they should never be discovered; but by one of themselves. Who would contrive when two be by, and if they say true might see them as well as hear them, though they did contradict one another in their Evidence, the one said he was above, the other said he was below, the one said he might see them, the other not. Look you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men I do see that they do lay some stress upon this, that he was his Debtor, for that they seem to prove by their Witnesses, but you must lay no great stress upon that at all, for the money were not quit if Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> were found Guilty, the money is due to the King then, He saves nothing by it, his mony must be paid let the Prisoner be found Guilty, or not Guilty, 'tis all one to him. You must consider this Case, Gentlemen, If you believe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Look you Sir <hi>Thomas Hodgson,</hi> and the Gentlemen of the Jury, if you will come in again in any time we will stay in Court, otherwise you must lie by it all night, for we can take no Privy Verdict in this Case.</p>
