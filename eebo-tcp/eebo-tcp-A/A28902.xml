            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Trifle which I am bold to prefix your Name in, like a well drawn Picture, looks alike on each of you, and challenges your Protection and Patronage, you being the ſole Promoters and Countenancers of its being what it is; your Commands, together with my want of Conſideration, made me undertake a Task which I am conſcious to my ſelf I am alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfit for. When I had plunged my ſelf into this Sea of Thought, I quickly found my Miſtake, and preſently became ſenſible of my Error, though too late to recall it, having given my Promiſe before for the performance of it. I have taken what care I could to walk by the Rules preſcribed me, as you will find by the peruſal of it. If there be any thing in it can force a Smile or a kind Look from you, I have reach'd my end, and hope it may take off the edge of your Anger at the reſt of an ill writ Play, which wants both Language, Wit and Plot, (which Three if I miſtake not,) are the chief Ingredients that make up a Comedy, with which if it be fraught, Nonſenſe may ſometimes paſs unregarded. I expect not in this Critical and Cenſorious Age to fare better than the reſt and beſt of Poets, who for the moſt part are branded with the Name of Scribling

            <l>INdulgent Parents take what care they can</l>
            <l>To breed their Son; but when he once writes Man,</l>
            <l>He thinks himſelf too great to be advis'd,</l>
            <l>And thoſe which took ſuch care, are then Deſpis'd:</l>
            <l>He ſets up for himſelf, and learns the way</l>
            <l>To Whore all Night, to Swear and Drink all Day.</l>
            <l>The Spark being thus accompliſh'd, think's he's fit</l>
            <l>At a New Play to be a Judge of Wit;</l>
            <l>And takes his Place with as much Confidence,</l>
            <l>As he that's Maſter of the greateſt Senſe;</l>
            <l>Sets his Cravat, and then invokes the Powers,</l>
            <l>And Swears all Vizard Masks are Common Whores.</l>
            <l>So Poets tickled with Applauſe, they are</l>
            <l>Quite alter'd, and no more the Men they were:</l>
            <l>They then grow Proud, and huff their Benefactors,</l>
            <l>And Swear the fault's not in the Play, but Actors.</l>
            <l>The Muſick that ſhall hardly ſcape his Curſe;</l>
            <l>The Scenes and Habits he likes ten times worſe;</l>
            <l>And all to make his Bandy Play go down,</l>
            <l>With the more civil Gentry of the Town.</l>
            <l>A Smutty Tale will pleaſe the Common ſort,</l>
            <l>His greateſt care is how to take the Court,</l>
            <l>And get the name of Poet from ſome Lord,</l>
            <l>None dare gainſay, but gladly take his Word.</l>
            <l>Our Poet's none of theſe, all his Intent</l>
            <l>Is among Neighbours to make Merriment;</l>
            <l>Which if it take effect, he'th gain'd his ends;</l>
            <l>If not, he hopes the Ladies are his Friends,</l>
            <l>And back'd by them, he cares not who contends.</l>
            <l>Our Poet to your Beauties doth ſubmit,</l>

I Long too methinks, to be making the Experiment; and for all my Diſſembling, do what I can, my Inclination lies toward a Man.</p>
