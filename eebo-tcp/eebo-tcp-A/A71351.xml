            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>According to the cu≈øtom of the Sheriffs Court in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Sheriff <hi>Lawrence</hi> ≈øent for ≈øome pri≈øoners over to an≈øwer to Actions. The pri≈øoners entred a Combination, abu≈øed the Jaylor, re≈øcue their fellows: (pretending 'twas a Cu≈øtom again≈øt Law) declaring they would make it a free Goale: The Sheriff goes him≈øelf, and ≈øeeing no rea≈øon or fair means would prevail, (and his partner Sheriff <hi>Wi≈øe</hi> being ab≈øent then at London, goes to Mr. Mayor and the Magi≈øtrates, complains of a Mutiny and Rio, (hoping by that means to reduce them, or have a more firm ground to u≈øe rigour, if need ≈øhould be.) The Magi≈øtrates not very willing to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, being a bu≈øine≈øs more proper to the Sheriffs; yet at length they ≈øend for four of the chief: Their an≈øwer is, They will not come, nor be trepann'd by Mr. Mayor.

Tho≈øe four, with ≈øome other, betake them≈øelves to a ≈øtrong Vault, and grow re≈øolute: but at length the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners propound, to draw off the Souldiers, and refer their main point to Coun≈øel, and if Law, they would ≈øubmit. The Souldiers thought that Demand ≈øo rea≈øonable, as they ≈øcrupled to a≈ø≈øi≈øt, and became Interce≈ø≈øors; whereupon it was agreed: There were al≈øo ≈øome other de≈øperate parties of pri≈øoners in other rooms, The Sheriff informs the Mayor and Court (then ≈øitting) what was done; the Coun≈øel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines again≈øt the pri≈øoners, but they fall from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe of appearing to an≈øwer.) The Sheriff propounds then to return and fall on them, and either fire upon them with powder and ≈ømall ≈øhot, or el≈øe (rather) to ≈ømother them out with wet Hay: This the Magi≈øtrates would not approve, but wave it at pre≈øent. Some two or three days after, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners fearing new matters again≈øt them, grew high, ≈øecure the Jaylor, and take away the Keys; the Sheriff forthwith requires aid of the Citizens, but mo≈øt of them ≈ølipt away:

                     <p>AMong all the great calamities which God mo≈øt ju≈øtly for our ≈øins hath brought upon us, ≈øince the fir≈øt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of our national di≈øtractions, none have made ≈øo deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions of real ≈øorrow upon our hearts, as the barbarous inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity Acted upon your Royal Father of ble≈ø≈øed memory, by certain wicked and deceitfull men: The remembrance of which, as it doth renew our utmo≈øt abhorrency of the Act, ≈øo of all tho≈øe Je≈øuitical Principles, which under any pretence what≈øoever, have any tendency to the depo≈øing, and much more the murder of Kings.</p>
                     <p>After the lo≈øs of the be≈øt de≈øerving King the world could then boa≈øt of, which was attended with the voice of bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy uttered by our enemies again≈øt the true Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øome who did profe≈øs it, had ≈øtained her beauty with their bloody hands. Gall was added to our wormewood by the forced exile of your Maje≈øty, during who≈øe ab≈øence abroad, we could hardly think our ≈øelves to be at home.</p>
                     <p>But God who comforteth tho≈øe who are ca≈øt down, gave us hope in the wonderfull pre≈øervation of your Maje≈øty at <hi>Worce≈øter,</hi> yea many ≈øupplications made for you by your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people, and e≈øtabli≈øhment of your Royal heart with his grace, to re≈øi≈øt and overcome a great crowde of Temptations both on the right hand and on the left, by holding fa≈øt the true Ancient, Catholique and Apo≈øtolical Faith once delivered unto the Saints. The≈øe things were to us as the dawning of the day of Salvation, which God after a darke night of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion, hath now (not by an ordinary working of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) cau≈øed to ≈øhine upon us. And we have cau≈øe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

that he who hath ≈øubdued the power of the Enemy, will al≈øo ≈øubdue their hearts; that as your Maje≈øties return hath been accompanied with the cordial de≈øire and joy of the mo≈øt of your ≈øubjects; ≈øo your reign will be with the great love and full ≈øatisfaction of all. And this our confidence is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed by your Maje≈øties gracious, charitable and healing Declaration of the fir≈øt of <hi>May,</hi> and your early Proclamation i≈ø≈øued again≈øt vicious, debauched and prophane per≈øons. For which, as we are always bound to prai≈øe God, ≈øo we do with all humble thankfulne≈øs, acknowledg your maje≈øties ≈øpecial grace and Princely favor. And what≈øoever our earne≈øt prayers to God, exhortations to our hearers, and dutifull ≈øubjection may po≈ø≈øibly contribute to the happine≈øs of your ≈øacred per≈øon and government; we ≈øhall with all alacrity and faithfulne≈øs perform, be≈øeeching him by whom Kings reign, to encrea≈øe your graces, pre≈øerve your health, prolong your days, and e≈øtabli≈øh the Crown upon your head.</p>

prepared for his Highne≈øs, he they on Foot marched to the Head of them, where that mo≈øt valiant and mo≈øt learned <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> (after an Elegant ≈øhort Speech on his knees to his Highne≈øs) pre≈øented him with the Leading-≈øtaff of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whereupon the Drums beat, with a very loud Acclamation of the Gentlemen in Arms. After ≈øilence was commanded, his Highne≈øs was plea≈øed to declare, how willingly he accepted of their offer, and would maintain all their Priviledges; then (throwing off his Cloak) he commanded them to march, him≈øelf on foot before them; and having led them about the ground, and drawn them up, he went to the Tent door, where he ≈øate while≈øt the Company marched by, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to ≈øee ≈øuch a gallant Company.
