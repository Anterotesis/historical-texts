            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Becauſe 'tis likely you'l have ſome falſe report of a mutiny of the priſoners in Norwich the 18. of July laſt, be pleaſed to take this Relation from one who was preſent.</p>
               <p>According to the cuſtom of the Sheriffs Court in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Sheriff <hi>Lawrence</hi> ſent for ſome priſoners over to anſwer to Actions. The priſoners entred a Combination, abuſed the Jaylor, reſcue their fellows: (pretending 'twas a Cuſtom againſt Law) declaring they would make it a free Goale: The Sheriff goes himſelf, and ſeeing no reaſon or fair means would prevail, (and his partner Sheriff <hi>Wiſe</hi> being abſent then at London, goes to Mr. Mayor and the Magiſtrates, complains of a Mutiny and Rio, (hoping by that means to reduce them, or have a more firm ground to uſe rigour, if need ſhould be.) The Magiſtrates not very willing to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, being a buſineſs more proper to the Sheriffs; yet at length they ſend for four of the chief: Their anſwer is, They will not come, nor be trepann'd by Mr. Mayor. The She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff is required to go himſelf for them; which he doth, but Orders privately ſome Files of Muſquettiers to fall in cloſe after him. Thoſe four, with ſome other, betake themſelves to a ſtrong Vault, and grow reſolute: but at length the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners propound, to draw off the Souldiers, and refer their main point to Counſel, and if Law, they would ſubmit. The Souldiers thought that Demand ſo reaſonable, as they ſcrupled to aſſiſt, and became Interceſſors; whereupon it was agreed: There were alſo ſome other deſperate parties of priſoners in other rooms, The Sheriff informs the Mayor and Court (then ſitting) what was done; the Counſel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines againſt the priſoners, but they fall from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of appearing to anſwer.) The Sheriff propounds then to return and fall on them, and either fire upon them with powder and ſmall ſhot, or elſe (rather) to ſmother them out with wet Hay: This the Magiſtrates would not approve, but wave it at preſent. Some two or three days after, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners fearing new matters againſt them, grew high, ſecure the Jaylor, and take away the Keys; the Sheriff forthwith requires aid of the Citizens, but moſt of them ſlipt away:

But with ſome few, and part of a band of Souldiers, reſolve (after Proclamation) to break open the priſon door, and at the ſame time ſcale two Garden walls on the back ſide of the priſon; but the Mayor and Juſtices coming in the mean while, after ſome mutual meſſages, and promiſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to their chief Captain (one <hi>Godfrey,</hi>) he opens the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon door, and comes forth; whereupon the reſt yeelded.</p>

prepared for his Highneſs, he they on Foot marched to the Head of them, where that moſt valiant and moſt learned <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> (after an Elegant ſhort Speech on his knees to his Highneſs) preſented him with the Leading-ſtaff of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whereupon the Drums beat, with a very loud Acclamation of the Gentlemen in Arms. After ſilence was commanded, his Highneſs was pleaſed to declare, how willingly he accepted of their offer, and would maintain all their Priviledges; then (throwing off his Cloak) he commanded them to march, himſelf on foot before them; and having led them about the ground, and drawn them up, he went to the Tent door, where he ſate whileſt the Company marched by, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee ſuch a gallant Company. After that, they divided into two Bodies, the one commanded by the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> and the other by Major General Sir <hi>Edward Maſſey</hi>; the great Guns playing, they immediately fell to skirmiſh, firſt by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne, afterwards in ſeveral figures. At His Highneſs departure, ſeveral Volleys were given. After his departure, the Bodies being joyned, the Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them, That a Gentleman, a Member and Well-wiſher of the Company, had preſented to them a Silver Partizan; for which (in the name and behalf of all) his Lordſhip gave the Donor thanks.</p>

You (ever for their ſakes) we will ſay and ſpeak truth, That His Majeſty hath given Admittance and Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to thoſe Perſonages, and others from <hi>Scotland,</hi> who came from Court highly ſatisfied with admiration of His Majeſties Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Affection to His People. And if you hear any ſpeak otherwiſe, know them ſo ſuch as wiſh it ſo, becauſe it is faelſe: They take liberty to talk, but thoſe that ſcribble or print it, ere long may repent.</p>
