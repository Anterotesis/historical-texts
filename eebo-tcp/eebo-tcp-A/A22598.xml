            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Lord the MONSIEVR, Sole Brother to the King of FRANCE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, ſo much is to be ſaid in your commendations, as to forbeare in ſo ample a ſubject of elocution, were rather an ingratitude then ſilence; and I never ſparing of my praiſes in all mens merits, ſeeming to have refuſed them untill now to yours, ſhall doe much better here to confeſſe, then to defend my thankleſneſſe. It is not my good Lord, but I have as much inclination to honour you, as I have cauſe, which is to have it in the greateſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can be imagined; but the ſame inſtigation I have had to ſpeake, hath made me ſtill ſilent, and the greatneſſe of the ſubject which had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated moſt, hath yet diſcouraged me. There is ſo farre a diſtance from your highneſſe to my
<pb facs="tcp:396:5"/>
lowneſſe, and twixt my own power and my will, as I deemed it a ſinne againſt my knowledge, raſhly to have undertaken a thing not poſſible to be performed, but in great imperfection: and that my enterpriſe would much rather have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my weakeneſſe then my intentions. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which my Lord, are they not the moſt rare affections which men teſtifie to their owne prejudice? how can I then more perfectly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt mine, then at the diſpenſe and diſrepute of my knowledge? How can I better make ſeen to you the paſſions that I undergoe for your ſervice, and for your glory then by the expoſing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid my own weakeneſſes, and my defaults? This conſideration my Lord hath changed my former feares into raſhneſſe, and hath made me ſo bold to undertake that, which I have not had the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to thinke of: beleeving that if the execution were impoſſible, yet the enterpriſe was at leaſt honourable, and by ſo much the fitter to manifeſt my devotions bent to you wards, as it beares me hood-winked beyond my knowledge and my power. But I am erred my good Lord even at the entry of my diſcourſe, which beginning with your commendations, as the greateſt and richeſt argument that could be choſe, I know not how I have ſo ſuffered my ſelfe to be carried away with my paſſions, as I have ſaid without thinking that which I would not, and have not yet ſpoke one word of what I would ſay. The cauſe of my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is the boundleſſe extent of my ſubject. Hardly could it be but I ſhould loſe me in a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
<pb facs="tcp:396:5"/>
from out of which it is ſo difficult to get; but the wonder is I have not entred it, and that in ſtead of looſing my ſelfe in ſearch of the iſſue, I have erred at the entry without once having found the beginning. But indeed great Prince, where is there any beginning in things infinite? If I ſhould begin at the greatneſſe of your birth, and weigh you as Prince of the chiefeſt kingdome in the world, and Son and Brother to the two grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Kings the earth hath ever bore; were I not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the excellence of your admirable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the exquiſite education wherewith it is ſo happily propagate, and by the ample hopes you give both of the one and the other? what multitudes of other things might here be added in your commendations, did I not feare to doe them wrong, and loved I not more to honour them in ſilence, then to injure them by going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſpeake their greatneſſe: but reducing me to theſe three onely, and ſpeaking but one word of each; what more excellent nature was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found in Prince, or more generous then yours? What <hi>Achilles</hi> fed with the marrow and pith of Lyons one day to ſubdue the force of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> does not give way to you as well in noriture, as couragious heart? And what hopes may we not well conceive from ſuch and ſo magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Prince, as ſurpaſſeth the greatneſſe of his birth by the excellence of his nature, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of his nature by the goodneſſe of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riture. But riſing up to the fount head, and ſcorſe of your great Anceſtors, and ſo deſcending by
<pb facs="tcp:396:6"/>
the ſucceſſion of ſo many Kings as have been ſince S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the great, I not obſerve you onely as a green and flouriſhing branch of theſtock of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> or as a Sience of that of <hi>Anjou,</hi> but as Sonne and Prince of <hi>France,</hi> that is to ſay, of the beſt houſe and moſt illuſtrious Empire of the world. What can I hope leſſe, or the enemy feare more, then ſome ſtill, and unexpected en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe mannaged with no leſſe ſilence and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, even to the entire and generall conqueſt of all ſuch authority as ſtrangers do uſurpe from us? victories ſeeming as incident unto the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as crowns ſeem deſtinated unto that of <hi>Anjou. Charles</hi> the brother of <hi>Lewis</hi> was the firſt of this family crowned King of <hi>Naples, Sicile,</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem. Lewis,</hi> brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the wiſe, and firſt Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> went to take poſſeſſion of thoſe kingdomes with 30000 horſe. And in our times the laſt <hi>Henry</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Valois,</hi> being then Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, was crowned almoſt againſt his will King of <hi>Poland.</hi> But the moſt honourable titles of all theſe Kings, were yet to be brothers to the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> For this cauſe only was it that <hi>Henry</hi> rather choſe the quality of Duke of <hi>Anjon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> then that of King of <hi>Poland.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon as well he as <hi>Francis</hi> his brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Princes of <hi>France,</hi> did precede the dead King your father, when as he was but King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre:</hi> which I ſpeake but by the way my Lord, to let you ſee how much this dignity of brother to the King ought be eſteemed by you before all
<pb facs="tcp:396:6"/>
the Scepters and the Crowns of the whole earth. Be it then that you would regain you the antient poſſeſſion of your inheritance in <hi>Italy;</hi> the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, of <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth, and of <hi>Francis</hi> the great, cauſeth the Alpes as yet to tremble. Be it that you would paſſe to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> the eaſtern Empire conquered, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the French, doth there (with all feare) ſtill redoubt their very name. If you would yet thruſt further, and as farre as <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the ſame French have conquered and poſſeſſed that alſo you may affright the Sultans of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Mores in <hi>Affrick,</hi> by the ſole memory of S. <hi>Lewis.</hi> In what part ſoever of the world fatecalleth you, thither may the renown of your predeceſſors open you a paſſage; No mountain is ſo ſteep that will not ſtoop below your feet, nor ſea ſo inraged and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, as not to be appeaſed and humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath your ſailes. Go on great Prince under the name and armes of that great King, to whom onely you ought reſt a ſubject. Goe and happily re-enter on the poſſeſſion of ſo many Realmes. Eface by your immortall acts, &amp; thoſe in the end worthy a <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the glorious memory and illuſtrious name of <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix.</hi> Make ſeen there is as much difference between your valour and your renown and his, as there is between his condition and his houſe and yours. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> intending to paſſe into <hi>Aſia,</hi> there was one of the ſtatues of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> whoſe forehead ſtood with ſweat, from whence the <hi>Augures</hi> drew a preſage that he ſhould there bring ſo great

things to paſſe, as ſhould produce ſweat on the browes of ſuch Poets and Muſicians, as ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to relate them. May you great Prince, beare Armes more farre then <hi>Alexander,</hi> and do thoſe deeds as the admiration and aſtoniſhment thereof may render men mute, and ſtatues ſpeaking, that after I have been often covered with ſweat in the purſuit of the thunder of your Armes in battell, I may again ſweat within their triumphs, ſinging the hymnes of your ſo glorious victories. So as I may from out thoſe large extended wings wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Renown it ſelfe ought beare your glory, draw a quill beſt capable of their deſcription, and which ſupplying the imperfections of this book, (that I purpoſe to the eternity of your memory) may leave to poſterity, works more worthy your name, and the deſire I have to ſignallize me.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Id I deſire to frame the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a true ſtory upon a tale, I might ſay the earth never produced the equall of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and deriving her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall from heaven, it were not onely a lye, but blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to bring her backe againe to earth. So then
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:396:14"/>
let us not ſpeake untruths for feare of lying, nor let us blaſpheme for feare of blaſphemy; fable hath no part in this diſcourſe, the Star by which I meane to ſteere my courſe, being truth it ſelfe. This here is not that <hi>Minerva</hi> the Goddeſſe, but a woman whoſe cleere minde and brave ſpirit hath acquired her the name of that <hi>Pallas</hi> preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Art and Armes; her birth was not of the head of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but of an illuſtrious family, the worth whereof hath beene ere whiles graced with the moſt honourable charges of this Realm, her father having left her very young, ſhe was married at 9 yeeres old to a husband but of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and as the one nor the other were then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of love, they produced no other but hate. Her deſire to be divorced from one ſhe loved not, cauſed her come to ſolicite her affaires at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where her beauty did acquire her rather ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants then Iudges; and where her youth more proper to the exerciſes of love, then buſineſſe of law, rendred her apter to hearken to the ſuits of her ſervants, then to give eare to, or proſecute her neceſſary ſuits. I know not whether ſhe were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell or favourable on their behalfe, but certaine am I that the <hi>Sejan</hi> horſe was never more unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to his Maſters, then ſhe to ſome of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Whileſt ſhe followed her affaires, <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myr</hi> was the firſt of whoſe ſervice ſhe admitted. I have heard him ſay, ſhe eſteemed more of his valour, then ſhe loved his perſon, and that her vanity to captivate ſo great a courage, cauſed her ſuffer the importunity of his purſuit, their love
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:396:14"/>
became hatred: <hi>Balamyr,</hi> were it through judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or inconſtancy, with, or without cauſe, quit her for another Miſtreſſe, and was unlamented of <hi>Minerva</hi> ſometime after ſlaine. But ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not without a ſervant, for ſhe wonne on all ſhe would, and ſhe would win on all ſhe could: and for all that ſhe complained here ſometimes of the miſerable conqueſts ſhe made againſt her will. She made no acquiſition but to her profit, and wherewith ſhe ſerved not her ſelfe in ſome deſigne or other. See here the cauſe why ſhe contemned not the affection of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ill ſhape, and worſe favour, rendred him ſufficiently contemptible. But <hi>Arnolph</hi> was he that moſt feelingly touched her to heart, all the reſt were amorous of her, and ſhe only of him. It was not that his ſervices or quality obliged her to love him more then ordinary: it was a certain inclination proceeded of the ſympathy in their wils, and I know not what feminine humour more taken with a ſoothing obſervance, or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome legge making, then with all the faire quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or good parts can be in a man, or the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt ſervices that can be rendred them. Many others fell into the ſnares of <hi>Minerva,</hi> whoſe vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar affections merit not a particular hiſtory, but ſhe kept alwaies a kinde of order in the receit of ſuch as ſhe intended to inregiſter in number of her ſubjects: for when ſhe began to favour <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolph,</hi> ſhe was fallen off with <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and never was reunited during the life of <hi>Arnolph.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe accepted of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> when ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:396:15"/>
was yet ingaged, and ſuffered that he ſighed for her, whileſt ſhe languiſhed for another. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> accompanied his affection with ſo much reſpect, as ſufficed to have begotten pride even in humility it ſelfe, and beſides was ſo ſenſible of offences, and ſo tenderly feeling the leaſt cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he would not have ſuffered them from a Goddeſſe, which was the cauſe that at ſome time or other he ſpoiled all his Miſtreſſes, and then that he undid himſelfe too: for that ſeeming not ſo much to love as to adore them, he ſo rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their haughty humour and naturall vanity above the condition of their ſexe, and gave them ſo abſolute an Empire, as himſelfe was not able to live under, ſo as he loſt often by impatience, what he had acquired by much paſſion: he threw well, but he plaid his game ill. The firſt occaſion of breach between him and <hi>Minerva,</hi> was but ſlight, and more capritious then reaſonable: as for the moſt part there appeares in the proceſſe of love, more rage then reaſon, but it was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a miſtake that is very pleaſant. <hi>Adraſte</hi> being at <hi>Minerva's,</hi> with one <hi>Thymon</hi> a fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, &amp; of a good wit, whom <hi>Minerva</hi> not diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of: after having entertained them ſome time in a low room, ſhee intreated them up the ſtairs, which were at the going out of the room, of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient breadth for two, but too narrow for three. When <hi>Minerva</hi> being about to aſcend, obſerved them both, looking one or the other of them would take her by the hand, and ſeeing both to recoile and ſtep back, ſhe goes up her ſelfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:396:15"/>
as to ſhew them the way. <hi>Adraſte</hi> forbore to take her hand, for that it ſeemed to him ſhe had firſt looked on <hi>Thymon,</hi> and <hi>Thymon</hi> abſtained to aſſiſt her, out of reſpect to <hi>Adraſte,</hi> who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about, got him out of doors, ſaying nothing to one or other, but went his way. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love, &amp; that in choler could cauſe him commit ſo great a diſcourteſie: <hi>Minerva</hi> marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not a litle, and <hi>Thymon</hi> was more aſtoniſhed at it. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> went not alone, for the vexation hebore along with him, made the greater part of himſelfe. After a profound conſideration of the fury of his diſeaſe, accuſing yet his Miſtreſſe of his owne fault, he reſolved with himſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, and found not a better meanes to mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his griefe, then (if it might be,) to disburthen himſelfe of it upon paper, he wrote to <hi>Minerva, That ſince for honouring her without any obligation, ſhe had ſlighted him without cauſe, making him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe ſuch puniſhments as hee was unworthy of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in place of the recompence he merited; hee was reſolved to keepe his ſervices for other favours, ſince ſhe kept her favours for other Lovers. I know well ſaid hee, that this will adde to your cantentment, and ſtill more aggravate my diſcontents: but the more violent they ſhall be, the leſſe laſting you had not been ſo ill to me, had you not found mee ſtill ſo good, but however it be the effect of a low ſpirit, to take occaſion from the goodneſſe of any one to uſe them ill, I never yet ſhall alter mine, to revenge me ought of your bad uſage. I doe confeſſe that I thus breake with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the moſt extremity of griefe I ever ſuffered yet, or ever can</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:396:16"/>
                  <hi>and which I never ſhall recover whileſt I live, and that if the wounds of the minde endure after death, eternity it ſelfe muſt onely be the tearme of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. But I ſhall chuſe to breath my afflictions elſewhere, or ſmother them in my owne breaſt, or that they ſmother me, then to increaſe them daily with new indignities. And if you wonder that I have taken ſo ſmall an occaſion, having heretofore paſſed by ſo great ones, remember that they are not the greateſt ſickneſſes, but they are the laſt that doe bring death: and that it is no marvell that ſo ſlight a disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſucceeding ſo many other inſupportable ones, ſhould now conclude the leſſe of what you have ſo many times neglected.</hi> Hee gave this Letter to a ſervant that <hi>Minerva</hi> knew not to belong to him, with his commands, that ſo ſoon as hee had delivered it to her own hands, he ſhould not ſtay for her anſwer. It was done juſt as he willed, this man went his ways to <hi>Minerva,</hi> to whom preſenting the Letter, he told her, that his Maſter moſt humbly kiſſed her hands; Who is he? ſaid ſhe. Madam anſwered he, that you ſhall finde in his Letters. Have a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience then anſwered <hi>Minerva,</hi> which ſaying, ſhe ſtepped into her Cabinet, as well to peruſe as to write an anſwer to her Letter, when ſhe ſaw it was not ſigned, the deſire and impatience ſhe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had to know the Author of it, was now by the difficultie redoubled. She ſtaid upon it ſome time to bethink her if ſhe could divine therof by the character. At laſt, being able to gather nothing from thence, ſhe commanded that they made the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:396:16"/>
meſſenger come in, but they found that hee was already gone, and with ſuch haſte, as all ſight of him was loſt. As yet, had <hi>Adraſte</hi> never wrote unto her before this time, and <hi>Minerva</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhee had given him any cauſe of diſlike, no way ſuſpected him for this Letter. But <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> being diſcontented at her, and ſhee yet much more offended at <hi>Craſſus,</hi> ſhee imagined it an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his ill will. And therupon writing back to him in the heat of her choler, and deſpight, and in the rage and violence of her firſt motions, ſhee returned him the moſt bloudy and injurious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that a furious and revengfull woman could bethink her of againſt a man. So as <hi>Monſieur Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> that had been before offended by her, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected rather to be ſatisfied, farre from what he looked for, received an amends much worſe then the offence. In the mean while, was <hi>Adraſte</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuffer the abſence of his Miſtris, and yet was unhappily baniſht her preſence, hee deſired with all impatience to ſee her, yet obſtinately ſhunned he all occaſions of ſeeing her, ſeeking and fearing in one and the ſame time to meet her, a troubleſome paſſion that brings us to will, and not to will in the ſame time one and the ſame thing. In matter of love a diverting on ſome other object, is no little helpe; <hi>Adraſte</hi> endeavoured what he could to divert himſelfe, and thinking to loſe the remembrance of his malady, found it even in the ſame divertiſement. Hee went to ſee a friend of his called <hi>Periſte,</hi> that tooke him a long to ſupper with him in the Suburbs of Saint
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:396:17"/>
                  <hi>Germans,</hi> with a certaine Gentlewoman named <hi>Oriſtene,</hi> to oblige him by a double pleaſure he added to the daintineſſe of their fare, the delight of Muſicke joyning with 4 or 5 Lutes, as many excellent voyces, of which <hi>Oriſtenas</hi> was the moſt excellent. All which did but more ripen the griefes of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and by the object of ſuch felicity, but repreſent the more to him his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe. It was that time of the yeare when the longeſt daies make the evenings moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, and diſpoſe lovers ſtill to give or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your <hi>ſerenades</hi> or evening muſickes, which awakened a marvellous deſire in the heart of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte,</hi> to preſent <hi>Minerva</hi> with one. All the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany agreed to it, <hi>Oriſtena</hi> her ſelf would make one of the party, which that ſhe might doe with the more convenience, ſhe changed the attire of her ſex, and put on mans apparell. They ſet her on a foot cloth nag, and all the reſt beating along on the hoofe, they left her lodging, juſt as the day left our horizon. <hi>Oriſtene</hi> lodged in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote quarters of the ſuburbs, and <hi>Minerva</hi> in the middeſt of the City, ſo as to goe from the one to the other, the directeſt way was through S. <hi>Germans</hi> ſtreet: when they were come ſo farre as the Well in that ſtreet, ſome 50 paces from the Abby, <hi>Oriſtena</hi> calling to her Page, which indeed was but a Laquay, was by her voyce knowne of ſome 4 or 5 that would needs lay hands on her horſe bridle. The Muſicians who were they that were neereſt to her, having drunk too much, and not underſtanding things aright, began to draw
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:396:17"/>
their ſwords, and charge upon them. Theſe Royſters defended themſelves, and but for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> that oppoſed himſelf unto their weapons, and making ſome by good words, others by threats retire, appeaſed the firſt tumult, there had been ſome extraordinary hurt done. They ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed all their ſwords but one onely, that looked as if he would have eat them all at a bit. <hi>Adraſtes</hi> choler roſe then above his wiſedome, to curbe; and doe you only Sir ſaid he, forbeare notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the wary example of your fellowes, and therwithall paſſed 5 or 6 thruſts juſt at the throat of him, and with ſo ready and able a purſuit, as the other warding and giving backe, without having leiſure to ſtrike one ſtroke, or ſpeake a word, found himſelf retired ſo far as the <hi>Serjeants</hi> barres, which is at the end of that ſtreet: and then Sir ſaid he, what injury have I done you? you have not put up your ſword for love ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> which I by force will now make you ſheath: that needs not Sir, I will put it up upon your word Sir, replyed he: do ſo then anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte,</hi> or you are but dead: he ſheaths his weapon, and thereupon <hi>Adraſte</hi> returned towards his friends, and the other followed him, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red likewiſe to finde his. So ſoone as they came neer the Well where they had left them, <hi>Adraſte</hi> found not any of his company, but in place, two men bearing a third under the armes, who as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning himſelfe, cryed with a faint and dying voyce, I am ſlain: he that followed <hi>Adraſte,</hi> knowing they were his frie nds, one of which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:396:18"/>
was run thorow the body, drew his ſword on <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte,</hi> and tilting at his back, cryed out, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, the murtherer, this is he that did it: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the others at once fell upon him, and the hurt man not able to do more, fell a crying, kill, kill, kill. <hi>Adraſte</hi> had much better have returned toward the Abby, then have gone forwards, for he had not found any other to encounter, then he that followed him, who would nere have ſtood him, but deſiring to overtake his company, and beleeving that they were got into the City by S. <hi>Germans</hi> gate, in purſuit of their firſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he flew amongſt the thickeſt of them before him, who made him way, on the violence of his fury, and having let him paſſe, followed him full cloſe along the butchery, did he not finde thinke you, his legs more uſefull to him then his armes? <hi>Adraſte</hi> had a little Engliſh foot-boy, who was by when the man was run thorow, and having ſeen part taking on all ſides but his Maſters, ſtood him cloſe up at a Butchers dore, with a bottle of wine in his hand, which he ſet down ſo ſoon as he ſee his Maſter ſo purſued, and ſuddenly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from his place, cryed out, courage Sir, here be all your friends; which words ſo replaced the heart of <hi>Adraſte</hi> in his body, and put ſuch afright in his enemies, as they all turned their backs ſo ſoon as he turned head upon them. For they all thought it true <hi>Adraſte,</hi> for that he deſired it, and they becauſe they feared that <hi>Adraſte</hi> having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to flee that had purſued him, and liking better of their rooms then companies, demanded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:396:18"/>
of his boy what was become of <hi>Periſte, Oriſtena,</hi> and the reſt that he left there. In good faith Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſaid he, I know not, but ſeeing you ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put to it, I thought it beſt to ſay they were all here. It was not ill done, ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> but let us go ſee if they be not gone into the City. As they went, the whole ſuburbs were in tumult, for theſe villaines in flying, had given the alaram every where, crying out, that they maſſacred <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the Princes officers, ſo as all was in rout, in hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub, and affray, which made <hi>Adraſte</hi> make more haſte to the gate of the City, hoping that his company were already entred, and that himſelf ſhould finde with them more aſſurance there, then without in the ſuburbs. But he found the gates already ſhut, and one of his Chanters on the bridge, like another <hi>Orpheus</hi> at the gates of hell, but that he intreated <hi>Pluto</hi> to let out to him <hi>Euridice,</hi> and others here begged leave of the Porter to let him into the City. <hi>Adraſte</hi> asked him what he made there, what was become of the company, and wherefore they had all left him ſo. I know nothing as concerning your two laſt demands ſaid he, but to the firſt I ſtay here to have them open me the gate, for me thinks the whole ſuburbs are raiſed upon us, and would to God I were gone with the loſſe of my Lute. As he yet talked, they perceived a company of ſome 30 or 40 perſons that came towards them, by the light of ten or a dozen torches that were carried before them. So ſoon as <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſaw them, he conceived that they were people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:396:19"/>
together to take him, and fearing to be ſo ſurpriſed againſt a gate that was ſhut againſt him, not having elſwhere paſſage then amongſt them, he reſolved to make himſelfe way by his ſword, as he had done a little before, but with as much more apparence of danger, as here were many more people: he expected to be ſlain, but he choſe rather to dye, then to be taken. Wherfore looking amongſt them, and making a flouriſh with his ſword naked in his hand, he ruſhed through the middeſt of this multitude; as it had been a mad man. Never in his life was <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſo happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all this heard of people fled, ſome here, and ſome there, and gave him no leſſe room then the whole ſtreet; he paſſed them like thunder, and fled much marvelled at ſo admirable a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: he need not feare following, for the others fled as faſt on the other ſide. But there were ſo great a number of them, that (not ſeeing any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence neer them when he was gone) they took hart at graſſe, as we ſay, and finding the Muſician and Laquay that had not the heart to flye, they laid hands on them. Note that it was a band of Comedians going to act before <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, accompanied with many others, as well women as men, who thinking of nothing leſſe then of the adventure of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> were put in greater afright then he. The Muſician thought himſelfe already hanged, and the foot-boy at leaſt flead alive; but ſeeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves not accuſed for having kild or hurt any one, and that they were onely demanded, who this mad man was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:396:19"/>
that had ſo furiouſly routed them, they eſcaped by denyall, and were quit by ſaying they knew nothing of the matter. <hi>Adraſte</hi> in the mean time went his way backe all alone to the houſe of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtene,</hi> where he found that <hi>Periſte</hi> had brought her back again, yet ſhaking with the feare this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had cauſed in her. Well ſaid <hi>Periſte,</hi> ſo ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Adraſte</hi> enter, much mooved with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes he had run; I beleeve it will be this two dayes before you deſire again to give your <hi>Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades</hi> or your <hi>Aubades</hi> more to <hi>Minerva.</hi> I am now ready as ever to return, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> but I aſſure you it ſhall be alone, for either I will ingage me in no quarrels, or I will not leave my friends engaged in them after I have my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun them, which I ſpeake not concerning you, for beſides that as I know well that you began not this, ſo had you enough to do to diſingage <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtine;</hi> But was it poſſible that four or five raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals ſhould ſo eaſily rout ſo many honeſt good fellowes? As you betook you to your ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that angry blade that would by no meanes ſheath up his, ſaid <hi>Periſte,</hi> his companions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe took them to theirs, I ſeeing them to runne after you, threw the formoſt of them to the earth with a thruſt I made, which ſtayed and took them all ſhort up. Indeed we were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number, but the moſt of us had no other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons then their Lutes, which they threw away the better to flye. Whileſt they made away, and the others took up their hurt man, I had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to bring back <hi>Oriſtene.</hi> You have done
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:396:20"/>
what you ought, and I what I could ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> aſſuring you that I beleeve there was never Knight errant that in one evening had two ſuch adventures or ſo ſtrange as I have had ſince ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; nor know I well if I may dare to tell them, ſince I can hardly beleeve them my ſelfe. Then diſcourſed he to them what had happened to him, and they knew not, leſſening yet the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe through whom he had forcibly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for feare they ſhould think it but a tale. But the Muſician and footman which he beleeved dead, or at the leaſt priſoners, upon the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſtory arriving, no little renewed his wonder, for he could not imagine how they had eſcaped. But how went you to work ſaid he, for I left yon invironed by fifteen or twenty people, from whom I ſcarſe hoped that ever you or my ſelfe ſhould have gotten free. Indeed Sir ſaid the boy, they were 30 of them or more, but they dreamt not of you, and they had more feare in them then they could put you in. And then the Muſician told them that they were certain Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians followed by many Lawyers and other gowned people, the moſt part of whom took their wives along with them to the play, which was to be acted at <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Princes Court. I wondred indeed how I came ſo valiant, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Adraſte,</hi> but now the marvell is over ſince I finde with what manner of people I had to doe. To all this diſcourſe poore <hi>Oriſtine</hi> ſaid never a word, though ſhe thought nere the leſſe, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much that ſhe ſhould pay deere for this piece

of folly, as indeed ſhe did: for the next day <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> and <hi>Periſte</hi> having taken leave of her, the Kings Officer in thoſe caſes, failed not to viſit her houſe, letting her underſtand, he would informe againſt the ryot committed the evening before, and to garniſh his Majeſties pockets, as the French hath it, began with the ſeiſure of her goods. But not to make a ſtarre-Chamber ſuit of this in place of a love ſtory, we will leave <hi>Oriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> to her ſuits, and follow the affections of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O misfortune but may bring good to ſome, the diſparagement of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtene,</hi> was cauſe of the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adraſte</hi> with <hi>Minerva.</hi> She for <hi>Adraſtes</hi> ſake, took ſome pains on the behalfe of <hi>Oriſtene,</hi> and then could <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte</hi> do no leſſe then go home to her, and thank her for it, where a peace was no ſooner treated then concluded. Hee craved pardon for his Letter, which, was indeed to excuſe him of a fault that none knew that he had done; ſo <hi>Minerva</hi> recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him the miſtake that it had cauſed her to make. Though ſhe loved not <hi>Adraſte,</hi> yet ſhee liked well to retain him for a friend, or at leaſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:396:21"/>
not to have him as an enemy, ſo as for ſometime he governed her very peaceably, by day he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with her to the Gardens of <hi>Ruel,</hi> and thoſe of Saint <hi>Germans,</hi> and by night he accompanied her to the accuſtomed places of bathing by moon-ſhine at the <hi>Tournelles,</hi> and afterwards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carrried her back to her houſe, and paſſed the moſt of the night with her, he uſually retired all alone, without light from the one end of the City to the other. Of 1000 men ſcarce ſhall ye finde one that would for 1000 women, do what he did for this one. Notwithſtanding one conge, one ſalute of <hi>Arnolphe</hi> wayed more in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Minerva,</hi> than all the ſervices of <hi>Adraſte.</hi> After ſome time, debating the matter with him, ſhe confeſſed to him, what indeeed ſhe could not deny. The ſame paſſion you have for me, ſaid ſhe, I have for him, and ſigheth as often for his love, as you for mine. But I tell you a ſecret, I ſhould be loth he ſhould diſcover; &amp; I ſwear to you by the love I beare him, that he hath never received the ſatisfaction therin which you have had, nor once hath hee pretended to it, however you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but what I might with, mine honour, grant. <hi>Arnolphe</hi> was a ſtranger, without name, quality, or eſtate, that entertained <hi>Minerva</hi> with diſcourſes of his own lightneſſe, inconſtancy, and the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes he reared therby to his vanity, ye, even to the prejudice of that diſcretion, ought to be uſed in like caſes. But ſhe, as if ſhee had had power to render him as well faithfull, as loving, beleeved that he would become better to her, than God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:396:22"/>
himſelf had made him, lived encharmed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circle of a faith much more amorous then reaſonable. <hi>Adraſte</hi> told her all theſe things, and that he much marvelled that already having bin deceived by one inconſtant man ſhee could yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſet her affections, on an other more to be doubted then the firſt. But ſaid ſhe, this is bad Rhetorick in you, to ſpeak ill, with intention to cauſe me wiſh you well. I cannot be ſo perfect as you goe about to make me beleeve of my ſelfe, if ſo I have not judgement ſufficient to make an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection worthy me. And grant that he wanteth all thoſe qualites you ſpeake of, yet ought not my affection to be the leſſe, that is not tyed at all unto the qualities and fortunes of a man, but meerely to his vertues and his demerits. Then did <hi>Adraſte</hi> take the courſe is ſeldome uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Rivals; Since it is ſo ſaid he, that your will and pleaſure beares you to this, I will by no meanes ſtand in oppoſition: It being altogether reaſonleſſe, that you having the power you have upon my liberty, ſhould not have the like upon your own. In my example you ſhall ſee allover, that doth for the love of his Miſtreſſe, love his rivall. I will for your love ſerve him, to the end that you even for his ſake ſhall beare me ſome good will. But yet remember you, that there ſhall be no juſtice left in heaven, it for the faithfull love of a ſlave that doth adore you, you endure not the ſhamefull tyrannies of a faithleſſe and impetuous Maſter, and in place of that eternity of divine honours, and everlaſting faithfulneſſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:396:22"/>
which I vow to you, you drown not your life in endleſſe ſorrowes, and ſoile not your name with as many infamous ſcandals (An unfortunate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that yet did prove more true). Howſoever <hi>Minerva</hi> loved <hi>Arnolph</hi> deerely, yet could ſhe not helpe it, but this extreme ſubmiſſion of <hi>Adraſte</hi> did o'recome her. And though <hi>Adraſte</hi> grieved to ſee <hi>Minerva</hi> loved another, yet could not he avoyd it, but this great freedome with which ſhe truſted him in a ſecret concerned her ſo neerly muſt needs oblige him much; ſo as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ſeemed to renounce each others love, yet diſavowed they not each others friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>Adraſte</hi> therefore in ſtead of becomming <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva's</hi> ſervant, became her friend, an exchange more neceſſary then favourable, but which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended meerly on her pleaſure. Whilſt <hi>Adraſte</hi> and <hi>Arnolphe</hi> thus pretended to <hi>Minerva,</hi> there was yet a third competitor that bore away the prize they expected and laboured for: but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it not o're-long, nor without much coſt, for indeed he was <hi>Clericus in libro,</hi> as we ſay, and not in this craft a Maſter. <hi>Minerva</hi> for want of good proſecution, and not of right, was quite o'rethrowne in her ſuit. There was one of the common Councell of the City, an ancient man, and of the longeſt continuance in the Court of Parliament, one powerfull in meanes and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and one that was not ignorant of all the quirks and quillets in the law, and in truth a moſt proper inſtrument to re-edifie and gaine againe a loſt cauſe, <hi>Minerva</hi> needed ſuch a man as this,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:396:23"/>
and her fortune would in ſtead of ſeeking him out, ſhe was her ſelfe ſought out by him. <hi>Tatius,</hi> ſo was this Councellor called, was of an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous complexion, and covered glowing fires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the embers of a grey beard. He had no ſooner ſeen <hi>Minerva,</hi> but he was taken with her, and ſhe well managing the occaſion, made him ſo wed her cauſe, as in place of counſell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Solicitor and party, and in a word gaind her the ſute which ſhe had abſolutely loſt, and got her to be ſequeſtred both body and goods from her husband: and all this without <hi>Minerva's</hi> once troubling her ſelf, which was the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe required &amp; beſt liked of. But this you may think could never be without much charge, the which <hi>Tatius</hi> very freely had disburſed, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with 5 or 600 crownes, that <hi>Minerva</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him out of her eſtate. For though <hi>Tatius</hi> were a gallant Gentleman, yet knew he well that it ſufficed not to carry away this prize from ſo many others braver then himſelfe, and he cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found that it behoved him render himſelf the more neceſſary, by ſo much as he was the leſſe pleaſing, and that he ſhould begin to ingage her eſtate ſomewhat to him, the better afterwards to intereſt him in her ſelfe. The deſign was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and ſubtile, and ſucceeded well in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, howſoever it fell out but ill to him in the poſſeſſion. The firſt took notice hereof was <hi>Adraſte,</hi> who incontinently told as much to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> letting her underſtand beſides, ſhe would become as meane a ſlave, as thoſe are commonly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:396:23"/>
ſold in <hi>Barbary</hi> at market, if ſo ſhe ever marryed this old Sire, that could not be ſo ſoon marryed, as jealous of her. And if it chance, ſaid he, as I have told you otherwhiles, that for being too covetous of your favours to one, ſo capable of the knowledge of their worth, the heavens ſhall after as a juſt revenger, conſent that you be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of them unto ſome ignorant, that no way ſhall finde cauſe to acknowledge them, or ſhall not be able to return their price; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, be ſatiate with your kindneſſes, afflicted with his happineſſe, and openly neglect even theſe your excellent beauties for ſome ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. And who ſhal then aſſiſt you to lamentyour cauſe after ſo fair a warning, as is this of your diſgrace! Who will not think fit ſuch a cruell one as bathes her ſelf ſtill in the bloud of ſuch as love her beſt, and is not pleaſed but in the murther of their inconſtant loves, at laſt ſhould fall into the hands of ſuch a ſot, as ſhould revenge by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous outrages, the moſt injurious diſdaines wherewith ſhe hath crucified ſo many faithfull ſoules? And to remember you that I have ſaid it is a miſery fatall unto ſuch as you; and by ſo much the more aſſured as it is little feared. <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> did but laugh at theſe his ominous predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and told him; then ſhe could with eaſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them all wholly falſe. <hi>Aruolphe</hi> wer't that he deemed it for the good of <hi>Minerva,</hi> or that he loved her rather for a Miſtreſſe then a wife, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſed her to marry <hi>Tatius:</hi> But ſhe having drawn, and got from him what ſhe would, now
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:396:24"/>
thought not but of the readieſt meanes to diſcard and caſt him off. <hi>Tatius</hi> was a Church-man, and upon that ſhe told him, that her friends took it amiſſe, that one of his coate ſhould ſo frequent her company: he ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and having obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a diſpenſation for marriage, he ſought her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. <hi>Minerva</hi> excuſed her then upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt their conditions, qualities, and manner of life. <hi>Tatius</hi> being a gowne man, uſed to the City. She being born in the Country, and bred up amongſt the Nobility. To every of her objections <hi>Tatius</hi> found an anſwer. I will ſell my goods, the places and offices that ſtay me in the City, ſaid he, and will alter my manner of living, to the end you change not yours. <hi>Minerva</hi> ſeeing her ſelf ſo incompaſſed on all ſides, had recourſe to the leſt remedy of Maids that would put off a ſuitor, they like not, which is to ſay, that they will never marry. Added further, that ſhe would become a votary, and that the better to apt and fit her to the formes and cuſtomes of a religious and ſolitary life; ſhe intreated, not onely him, but likewiſe all ſuch as did her the honour of viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to abſtain from thoſe favours. Pay back the moneys that are owing me, ſaid <hi>Tatius,</hi> then, ſince I muſt loſe the fruit of all my ſervices; when you ſhall owe me nothing, nor we have more to do with other, I am content ſince you will have it ſo, then not to ſee you any more; but till we are even, I pray forbeare to take from me the honour of ſeeing you. Though <hi>Minerva</hi> were deſcended of a right good family, yet could ſhe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:396:24"/>
not ſuddenly lay down the 6000 crowns ſhe ought him, without ſelling away part of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, nor could ſhe finde the man would doe it for her: And <hi>Tatius</hi> proceeding in law, had got a decree for the whole ſumme: ſhe was drawn dry by her ſuits, and her expences cauſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at <hi>Paris;</hi> Moreover ſhe being as yet in pupil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, her eſtate mannaged by over-ſeers, brought her not in the moyety of the true value. <hi>Arnolphe</hi> was a ſtranger, and without eſtate, as hath been ſaid, and it he had abounded, yet had <hi>Minerva</hi> much rather have given to him, then to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him; and by misfortune he had got a wound on the arme, in the time of <hi>Tatius</hi> his hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt purſuit, by one that he deſired not to kill, though he dyed himſelf within three daies after of that hurt, leaving behinde him a moſt violent griefe and uncomfortable ſorrow in the heart of <hi>Minerva.</hi> There was none left her then but <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte,</hi> who had from farre foreſeen this ſtorme; though when he ſaid ſo, he was not beleeved. Should ſhe now have recourſe to him, after ſo often making her ſelfe merry at his predictions, and demand counſell of him, having before ſo often ſlighted his adviſe? It muſt needs be, to whom indeed ſhould one reſort, but ſuch of whom they have had ſo oftentimes ſufficient proofe of their fidelity? ſhe diſpatched then a Gentleman to him being at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhe in the Country, to lament her misfortune, accuſe her incredulity, and demand his adviſe in a caſe of ſuch importance. <hi>Adraſte</hi> had much rather have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:396:25"/>
given her help then counſell, but he could not; his father was yet living, and he managed but what he allowed him, which ſcarſe ſufficed for his own entertainment. Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> gave him indeed ſome times a quarterly penſion, but it was caſuall, and not certain, had it been ſufficient, nor ſufficient, had it been certain. He truely loved <hi>Minerva,</hi> and if ſhe had given him time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it, he had rather ſold what ere he had in the world, then have failed her, but ſhe asked his counſell in a thing that was already paſt and done: and though he knew not that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of, for all that he doubted much it was exceeding forward. For <hi>Minerva</hi> preſſed by the importunities of <hi>Tatius,</hi> after all the ſhifts and doubles that the craft and ſubtilty of women could invent, yet was at laſt conſtrained to marry him, but in clandeſtine manner, and to the end to deceive and caſt him off, as ſhe had done the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, getting a promiſe from him, that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhould not be conſummate untill ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after, in which time ſhe thought to take ſome order in her affaires, and finde meanes to pay him. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> knew not of this, he wrote unto her then in theſe very words:</p>

                     <hi>Adraſtes</hi> Letter.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>WHat I have heretofore oft ſaid, proves now too true. It reſts then in you to make it appear in human things whether there be predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, er free will; ſince if you be forced through neceſsity to imbarce this your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, I ſhall henceforth beleeve it altogether boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to foreſee, or to forewarne the event of things, ſince they are by no means to be avoided. If you be not, I ſhall beleeve you Miſtris of your will, and that it is not in the power of any living man to force it. It is hard to conſtraine ſuch as are yet in the obedience which you have diſpenced with, nor can ſuch a thing be done but with much griefe, and more misfortune. You know it by the experience you have had; and if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to weigh it well as once, you are to think upon it twice. But why complain you of unhappineſſe, ſince you will needs be ſo? Is it not well known that it can never be unleſſe yon will, there being naught ſo free as marriage is? Think not that theſe complaints again ſhall ſerve you for excuſe, they at the firſt indeed were not amiſſe, when you were but an Infant, and in the power of thoſe reſpected more themſelves then you. And how be it that then you were free from fault, yet know you well, what you your ſelfe didundergo therin. The authority of friends no more can heer conſtraine your infancy. If you do well, the glory will be yours, if ill, lament you of it to your ſelf, for no man elſe will grieve for you, but I, that cannot chuſe but grive that</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:396:26"/>
you the Miſtris of perfection, ſhould be deſtinate to things ſo diſagreeable. If ſo you be obliged by any man, twere fit you gave him ſatisfaction in't, but not unleſſe you will at price of your ſelfe, thinke but what muſt follow, what you are to do, and of the pleaſure you ſhall take in't, if ſo your diſcord bring you once more, before the Iudges. But I beleeve it is to little purpoſe that I argue, and my reaſons will not ſerve ſo much to profit you, as to my own diſcharge; However, had I the honour to ſee you, I might perchance ſay that unto you, might bring you about to another minde. And if it be not now too late, and that the pleaſures you do expect from this your Lover, not precipitate your better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, I yet may have a word or two with you before it be long. But if the ill be helpleſſe, and you muſt drink of this medicine, prepare you it ſo, that it be profitable to you yet. Tis all the counſell I can give, in that of which I know not how to adviſe my ſelf, that could have wiſhed this comfort in my loſſe, that at the leaſt I had ſeene it profitable unto you. Faireſt <hi>Minerva</hi> adiew, I cannot keep me more from my lamenting, then I can from loving you; wel may you be unto another, but I can never be to any one but you; and as for you I do beleeve that being unable to be what you ought to me, you will at leaſt be what you may. If you have wept the death of your <hi>Arnolphe,</hi> now lament the life of your <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that never can eſteem it ſo as the honor to have power to loſe it once in ſerving you, and her to reſt yours.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Minerva</hi> had once received this Letter, ſhee became afflicted with two moſt ſenſible and violent griefs, one from the loſſe of a friend ſhee loved above her ſelfe; the other from poſſeſſing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:396:26"/>
an Enemy ſhe hated more then any thing. In the one there was no remedy, nor in the other but a very little hope. And is it not enough, ſaid ſhee, that I have loſt the man more deere to mee then all the world beſides, but that I muſt be forced to marry one, moſt hatefull unto mee of all the earth? Oh <hi>Adraſte,</hi> how juſtly now migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou ſcoff at my vanity. <hi>Adraſte</hi> mocked her not; but ſeeing <hi>Tatius</hi> Quarter-maſter in her houſe, and watch ſo neere all manner of reſort therto, as that there was no approching her but by his means, he did conceive he had no more to do, and that twas fit he then ſhould loſe deſire, when hee had left to hope. <hi>Tatius</hi> ſlept not the whileſt, The ſix moneths agreed on paſſed, the marriage indeed was conſummated with all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie, but her great belly ere it were long made ſeen the whole myſtery, and conſtrained them to celebrate publikely the marriage they had ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly made behinde the curtain. So was <hi>Minerva</hi> almoſt as ſoon brought a bed as married, &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a jealous fellow that would not fail to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh thoſe unhappy preſages of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that armed him with reſolution, and conſtancie, and knowing love beſt to be cured by ſome other love, loſt the ſorrow for his firſt Miſtris in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and ſervice of a ſecond and new one, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> wrote to him yet ſome little time after her marriage, but ſuch a Letter as the extravagance ſhewed well the ill ſeat of her wit and judgment; ſhe wrote him word, <hi>That ſhe was much ſatisfied fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the contentment which ſhe had purpoſed to have given</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:396:27"/>
                     <hi>to him, or at leaſt to have let him ſee the deſire ſhe had to content him.</hi> All the reſt of the Letter was but teſtimonies of good will, well wiſhes and offers of remembrance, proteſtations, and oaths to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme him above all the World, and deſires of his company, <hi>Adraſte</hi> anſwered. <hi>That after much pondering the contentment ſhee ſaid ſhee had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to give him, and the ſatisfaction which reſted to her in having made known to him ſuch her deſire; he by no means found that the one or the other was come to him, without ſhee thought ſhe had contented him in ſaying that ſhee was well pleaſed at his contentment, that ſhe might well have afforded him other ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which had more obliged him then ſuch, and from him might have rendred her ſelfe better, then thoſe the people gave her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhee ſeem'd to ſhew her good will when ſhe had no longer power to manifeſt it, and offered now her well wiſhes to render the loſſe of her affection the more inſupportable, that all theſe proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and theſe oaths made of her good eſteem of him, gratified him not, that it was oncly a dainty ſhe whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by his mouth, mocking him that had ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to honour him leſſe, and love him more. That ſince there was no meanes for him to ſucceed and inherit the affections of the dead, whoſe his had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, he prayed heaven that he might be deceived in his predictions rather then ſhe in her election, and that ſhe might enjoy as much contentment in what ſhe did poſſeſſe, as he had ſorrow for what he did looſe. As for his company, that he wiſhed it no leſſe uſefull unto her, then hers to him was deere; that he already had rendred her the addues ſhe ſent him, with more</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:396:27"/>
                     <hi>weight and meaſure then ſhe did receive them, and if per adventure ſhe doubted it, the greateſt pleaſure ſhe could doe him, was to examine it. Minerva</hi> ſeeing <hi>Adraſte</hi> thus in merriment, beleeved he was no longer in love; and as we know not the price of things till after their loſſe, ſhee found the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fidelity of this Lover, too late, and when ſhe had not meanes left her to gratifie them. Moreover as things never appeare ſo much as when they are oppoſed unto their contraries, the harſh nature of <hi>Tatius</hi> cauſed her now to taſte the ſweetneſſe of that gentle one of <hi>Adraſte:</hi> And ſhe by meanes of the tyranny was practiſed upon her, bethought her of the Empire erewhiles ſhe had exerciſed on him. The ſervile condition to which ſhe was now reduced, made her not onely lament the liberty ſhe had taken to her ſelfe, but the ſoveraignty alſo which ſhe had held on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And conferring her preſent miſery with her paſſed felicity, ſhe eſteemed her by ſo much the more wretched, as ſhe remembred her to have been moſt happy. <hi>Tatius</hi> uſed her honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yet in all appearance, much rejoycing him in the good huſwifery, and vertuous qualities of his wife, but in effect, ſhe was confined to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate corner, where ſhe had ſufficient leiſure to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her follies. Her houſe heretofore open to all commers, where ſhe had wont be often viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her friends, indeed was not forbid them, but ſhe ſhut from them, without leave ſo much as once to ſee her kinsfolks. And in the meane time <hi>Tatius</hi> entertained his gueſts, in which he

was little skilled, for nere did Clowne act well a Gentleman; and he being born in the City, and brought up a Lawyer, knew better how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a Iudge, with his Writs and Motions, then good company, with the civilities and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are practiſed amongſt Ladies and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers that live in the Country. Beſides, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tatius</hi> was meane, but for the eminenco of his places, which having ſold, he had nothing left him praiſe-worthy, without it were a few goods that could not long continue. His friends they thought much on't that he had put off all his Offices of credit and of profit, both which had made him appeare eminent and in authority in the prime Court of Parliament in <hi>France,</hi> to live a private life in the Country, without any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence at all, and that he had prejudiced his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes for a wife, that kept hers intire to her ſelfe: and the friends of <hi>Minerva</hi> ſeeing <hi>Tatius</hi> Iack out of office, as we ſay, and without employment, were very ſorry that ſhe had taken a man that had put off the authority, which indeed onely made him worthy of her. So things ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the friends on both ſides, it was yet much worſe between themſelves, <hi>Minerva</hi> by ſo much the more ſenſible of the ill uſage of <hi>Tatius,</hi> as ſhe little dared to complaine, and <hi>Tatius</hi> by ſo much the more continuing to uſe her ſtill worſe and worſe, as ſhe continued to ſuffer it. <hi>Minerva</hi> lived three yeeres in this bondage, which wereto her no leſſe then three ages, perpetually thinking of ſome meanes to redeeme her. At laſt having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

upon it, think you not Sir ſaid ſhe, that the aſſembly of ſo many wrongs and injuries as you doe daily heape on me, will not one day breake upon and ſtrike you too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for me, I ſhould rather chuſe to dye, then once to give you cauſe to uſe me thus; But I confeſſe unto you truely, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I had much rather dye, then longer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them. <hi>Tatins</hi> not being uſed to be braved by a woman, much leſſe by his wife, anſwered ſternely to her, that there was no meane between them, but that ſhe muſt reſolve to endure the one or of the other. <hi>Minerva</hi> replyed not to him, but bethought her preſently what ſhe would doe upon this. The miſhap or imprudence rather of <hi>Tatius</hi> would that he muſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to <hi>Minerva</hi> an opportunity to order her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and to diſpoſe them in ſuch manner, that upon the returne of <hi>Tatius,</hi> ſhe cauſed him to be told, that ſhe had reſerved two chambers to her ſelfe, which ſhe intreated him to afford her, and content him with the reſt of the houſe, which ſhe left wholly to him. <hi>Tatius</hi> that lookt not for this, would needs to her to anſwer her in proper perſon: but ſhe would not ſuffer him ſpeake to her, or by any meanes once ſee her: and in ſtead of now playing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at home, he found that ſhe was at home in truth, and that he was become the weaker; So as neither prayers nor threats being able to ſhake the reſolutions taken by a determinate woman, he was conſtrained to returne backe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:396:29"/>
to <hi>Paris,</hi> whether ſhe followed him ſoone after, with purpoſe to ſequeſter her eſtate from his; very ſorry that two children that ſhe had had by him were the cauſe ſhe could not be ſeparated from him in body as well as in goods.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Inerva</hi> being disburthened of a charge, ſhee thought her ſelf very unfit to beare, turned her whole Meditations to the meanes by which ſhee need never return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge; and to this effect having eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed ſome order in the managing the affairs of her houſe according to the neceſſity of her new Common-weal, ſhee took her way preſently to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither ſhee was called not onely for the execution of her deſigne; but likewiſe for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of her deſires: For her uſuall reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this incomparable City, where ſhee had taſted ſo many delights, was become more deer, and farre more pleaſing to her, then that of the Country, where ſhee had reaped no other then a bitter harveſt. <hi>Tatius</hi> not leſſe feeble in adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:396:30"/>
then inſolent in his better fortunes, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not ſo ſoon that ſhee was there arrived, but hee ſent unto her to intreat ſo much favour as to be admitted to ſeeher. It was too ſoon to deſcend ſo low, as to beg leave of his wife to ſee her; in ſtead of the poſſeſſion which hee wont, and ought yet to have had of her; and a wife which but three dayes before he not ſuffered to ſee any man. Hee ſhould have done like <hi>Alcibiades</hi> that bore away his wife by force, through the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like hall, and from amidſt the aſſembly of all the people, where ſhe had ſummoned him to appear. But he paſſed from one extreme to another, and fell from a moſt inſupportable tyranny, into a dejected and moſt inſufferable ſervitude. <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> admitted him to come ſeeher, and this weak man thinking to mollifie by prayers, her whom he had not had power to overcome by threats, and recover by humility, what he had loſt by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, not onely made her al the offers due from a husband to a wife; but rather all the ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that a ſlave oweth his Maſter. <hi>Minerva</hi> for her part did render him all the honour of the world, but without the leaſt being moved by his prayers, or any way ſlacking her purſuit; moſt humbly intreating him to pardon her, if ſhee ſought the aſſurance of her life in that of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, of which ſhee had not ſo much as thought, had not hee himſelf inforced her to it. So were their eſtates parted, and by conſequence their bodies; for <hi>Minerva</hi> ſaid ſhe had children enough for the fortunes ſhe poſſeſſed, &amp; not being able to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:396:30"/>
maintain any more, ſhe would by no means make any more: Poor <hi>Tatius,</hi> didſt thou for this remove the earth, Eye heaven it ſelf almoſt, to ſequeſter this woman from her firſt husband, to the end to ſee her now again ſequeſtred even from thee? Muſt thou make merchandiſe of thy whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and thy honours both, of whatſoever thou didſt poſſeſſe in all the World, to have a wife, which thou indeed haſt not? <hi>Minerva</hi> having rid her of this thorn out of her foot, learned the news of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and having bin informed of his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave him preſently to underſtand where hers was, and <hi>Adraſte</hi> went thither to ſee her ſoon after; at their firſt greeting, they ſtaid ſome while to view one another, both equally aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Minerva</hi> with a little ſhame, and <hi>Adraſte</hi> with ſome wonder. Well, Madam, ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaluted) you have found at laſt that I am no leſſe veritable then unhappy, ſince my predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have not onely proved true: but unavoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble likewiſe. Would I had never ſpoke them, ſince they have proved ſo inprofitable, and were received as ill preſages, which for the moſt part but foregoe miſhaps. Indeed <hi>Adraſte,</hi> ſaid <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> I avow it, that you have ſhewn more judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by foretelling my misfortunes, then I have in myaddreſſes to avoid them; but you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant it is more eaſie to foreſee, then to prevent ſuch things by much. The cauſe why we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wiſely undertake the things, that doe not alwaies well ſucceed; being cleere that it reſts but in our powers to undertake, as wholy it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:396:31"/>
longs to God to give the event. You onely ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> have the art to make thoſe things ſhew well that in themſelves are nothing ſo; which here I come not to ſubvert, much leſſe yet to complaine of you whoſe fortunes I lament more then my owne. So have you indeed more cauſe to plaine my miſeries, then to complaine of my actions, anſwered <hi>Minerva,</hi> no one of them ere tending to your diſpleaſure. But tell me now how reſt I in your memory, and how may I hope to be therein reſerved henceforward. Aſſure you Madame anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> you abide there bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ever, where I preſerve you with much more eaſe, and farre leſle trouble then I was wont to doe: And as for what depends on time to come, you know we poſitively can ſay nought. And I have been ſo much deceived in the event of things are paſt, that I dare promiſe nought in future, elſe had I ſworne to you ere this, that all the waters fleeting in oblivions ſtreame, are not of force to waſh you cleere from thence; but by the incertainty of things have happened late to me, I judge that it may be that I may beare you long in minde, and with more ardure and more paſſion too, then ever yet: and likewiſe it may chance, the helps of reaſon, time, and abſence, may doe me the grace to have power to looſe your memory. The greateſt diſpleaſure that a man can doe a woman whom he hath euer loved or honoured, is to let her ſee that he loves her no more: for it ſeems an outrage done to their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Minerva</hi> for all ſhe was much moved, yet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:396:31"/>
ſmiled at this anſwere, for amongſt other parts of diſſimulation, or of prudence, ſhe had that, never to manifeſt the leaſt feeling of a grudge, but on the inſtant of her revenge. She ſaid then to him, that ſhe was very glad to ſee him cured of an affection which her honour forbade her to remedy, provided that the cure were perfect, and not rather a ſtupifying of the apprehenſion of it; for then ſaid ſhe, ſuch as complaine the leaſt, are they are moſt to be feared, for that their ill is by ſo much the greater, as their ſence of it is the leſſe: Moreover as the cure ought be entire, ſo ſhould it be moderate, for that ſhe had heard, that too perfect a health was oft the preſage of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſe, and ſhe feared a ſervitude by ſo much the greater as his liberty now ſeemed the more boundleſſe; which ſhe conceived altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incompatible with his humour, that ſhe thought unable, not onely to undergoe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but more to ſuffer the remedy. Excuſe me if you pleaſe, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> I ſhall bear them both, ſo they come together, but I love not the one without the other; for that the remedy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the evill is to no purpoſe, and the evill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the remedy is inſupportable. Well then, ſaid <hi>Minerva,</hi> you aſſure me to be without the diſeaſe, and I promiſe you not to miniſter the remedy. We are then agreed, Madame, anſwered <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte,</hi> I demand nothing of you, and you grant me my requeſt: which ſaying, they fell both in laughter, and to diſcourſe of ſuch accidents as were befallen them ſince their laſt intervenue.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:396:32"/>
                  <hi>Minerva</hi> related to him the indignities <hi>Tatius</hi> had done her, which cauſed her ſeek the aſſurance of her life, in that of her eſtate, with as much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row yet as any vertuous wife could have in the diſpleaſure of her husband. I marvell not much ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> at what is happened unto you after having been ſo often forewarned, before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell you. I ſhould haue wondred if it had beene otherwiſe. Since you merit it by your increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though not in your actions. I cannot render you ſo ſmall good will, but I wiſh you much better then him, though I grieve more for him, then I doe for you; ſince you have loſt a man whoſe acquiſition was your miſhap, and he hath loſt a wife whoſe poſſeſſion was his whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Comfort you ſo your friends ſaid <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va:</hi> yet more harſhly, ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> when they dare to complaine to me of ils they ſuffer for their pleaſure, and for not beleeving me. I am further then from daring to complaine to you of the death of <hi>Arnolph</hi> ſaid ſhe. For that anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> I ſhall compatiate with you in your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap; <hi>Arnolph</hi> being dead by an accident wherein you had no hand. There is much difference in the misfortunes we ſuffer innocently, and thoſe we undergoe by our own default. But if you be not receivable in demanding of my counſell or reſolution, on the divorce of a husband, how think you to be in demanding it on the loſſe of a Rivall; had I not as much cauſe to rejoyce me for my own intereſt, as to afflict me for yours? And you Madame, that have ſaid you will give me no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:396:32"/>
help, how dare you demand of me my advice? I could doe no leſſe, anſwered <hi>Minerva,</hi> then to promiſe my refuſall of help, when you aſſure me not to have any need. Well Madame, replyed <hi>Adraſte,</hi> but when I doe aſſure you of need, will you aſſure me of help? When, how when, ſaid <hi>Minerva?</hi> It is impoſſible to come ny fire without being heat; <hi>Adraſte</hi> converſing daily with <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> whatſoever liberty hee had recovered by his abſence, &amp; her marriage, became reingaged in the inevitable charmes of her allurements, and ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the ſame amorous infection, wherwith ſhe woundeth all the world. After long arguing in favour of his reaſon, he concluded yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſwinge of his paſſion, and judged it better for him to ſubmit with all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Empire of this ſo excellent a beauty, then he to reſiſt it onely. If he were troubled to reſolve this, be ſure he was more to confeſſe it. He was much aſhamed that he had plaid the fool, and rendred himſelfe ſo flexible. It ſeemed ſtrange unto him, to have ſlighted one he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, and again to adore the woman he had ſlighted ſo: he cald to minde the firſt ſhipwracke he had undergone with her, and by that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the ſecond, remembred him how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily he had been ingaged in his affections, and with what pain he was retired. It ſeemed to him he did but breake in two theſe chaines were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt now worn out, to carry new more ſtrong, and that he freed himſelf but from an eaſie hold, to re-enter in a priſon farre more mercileſſe.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:396:33"/>
That he ſhould quit a Maſter that he had more cauſe to praiſe, then to complaine of, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ils he had wiſht him, had not yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to wiſh him well, and ſuffer underneath a mercifull reſentment of his paſſions. But love, what can it not in a gentle heart? At laſt, hee confeſt to her that more then her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and his abſence, the many perfections which hee ſaw in her, oppoſed to the many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults he felt in himſelf, had inforced him to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe a remedy more ill then his diſeaſe, which having coſt him much to finde would coſt him more to loſe. That her great beauties which wholly occupied his ſoule, being yet raviſhed from him, as all hope of their poſſeſſion was moſt injuriouſly torn from him, twas no way to be deemed ſtrange, if ſo deſpair had put to death deſire, that could not livewithout it were in hope, That to ſave him from the tyranny of one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter onely, he had bin conſtrained to make him many; and not unprofitably to love one thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe object ever hee had diſperſed the ſtream of his paſſions, and divided his affections into as many places, as he found ſeveral ſorts of objects. That erring like the Pilot that had loſt his ſtarre, and rendring him like to the trees on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that do bear fruit, but for the paſſers by, he was become infetterd in a chain ſo ſweet in appearance and fair in effect, that he had willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himſelf thruſt in his armes, and did eſteem him now more happy in the loſſe of his liberty, then he could be in conquering the whole earth. But
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:396:33"/>
that as all things have a certain revolution within the courſe of which, theyby a time return to their firſt heads, his deſtiny conſtrained him now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into that honorable ſervitude, in which ſhee captivated the moſt beautious ſouls. <hi>Minerva</hi> not leſſe wondring at the love of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> then ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with her own beauties, of which ſhe had heer an illuſtrious proof in this ſecond conqueſt of this lover, anſwered him in theſe terms. If any other then your ſelf ſhould talk to me thus, <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte,</hi> either I ſhould not believe him at all, or at leaſt ſhould fain not to believe him. But the knowledge I have of your goodneſſe, makes me that as I eſteeme you veritable, ſo will I anſwer you from my own heart, believing you ſpeak to me from the bottom of yours. And to obſerve the ſame method you hold with me in confeſſing your thoughts, I ſhall diſcover mine to you, and acknowledge that if I were in ſuch condition as I could give me to any one, it ſhould be you. But I will not forbear to tell you many things that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me therin, though you do know them neer as well as I; to the end that if you do not receive the ſatisfaction you have promiſed you, you may lay the fault on your own errours, and not upon my will, that never ſhall be wanting in good wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes to you, nor to perform like deeds on your behalf. <hi>Minerva</hi> diſcourſing afterwards the cauſes hindred her from loving of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> miſſed not to put that of god, in the firſt place, whom wee ought to love and fear above all things; and you ſaid ſhee that love and feare him above other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:396:34"/>
men, would cauſe me render him my enemy for your love. This divine reaſon is of ſuch force, as there is no humane paſſion can or convince it, or withſtand the being overcome by it. But if you diſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>eſteeme of god, which were ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an offence, wher of the monſtrous impiety could never be ſufficiently chaſtiſed, or what could perſwade you to make mee believe that I could ever live, after being robbed of my honour in this World? And you that hazard oft ſo generouſly your life to ſave your honour, how dare you heere propoſe to mee the loſſe of mine? Is not the honour of us Ladies pray, all out as choice and delicate as that of men? And if you love me as you ſay, and as I do believe, why do you deſire to loſe mee ſo? can you love my perſon, and neglect my honour? Madam, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> my diſcretion may be ſhield unto your honour, and this ſame innocent feare you have of doing ill by favouring me, is void of likelihood. God is not the enemy but the author of nature, and the offence without ſcandall is no offence. Believe you that the naturall affection, the author of nature imprinteth in our ſouls, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the will of him that gives it us? and that the firſt thing he ever commanded, he ſhould now forbid us? God wiſheth us no il, but for the ils we do to our ſelvs, nor takes amiſſe the offeces done to him, but thoſe we do to our ſelvs, for being ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ker of the univerſe, his care is moſt to perſerve his workmanſhip, &amp; his offence, at that, would hinder it, and not at that, which meerly tendeth to the conſervation of it. Then, is he, the enemy of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:396:34"/>
injuſtice, cruelty, and the ingratitude that tend to the ſubverſion of love, and not of love it ſelf, and he is angred that we turn his ſweets to bitterneſſe, and doe convert to our dammage that which he hath given us for our benefits: For as love is the cauſe of our greateſt goods, ſo may it become of our greateſt ils; but then it muſt be by our own improvidence, and not by his. See then, who offends moſt the divinity, Madame, or I that follow the lawes of love, according to the end for which they firſt were made, or you that do endeavour what you may to change and to pervert his inſtitutions; and chuſe rather to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you to the counſell of a thankleſſe and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall rigour, then the true apprehenſion of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination, that is not only permitted, but commanded. It is true, that God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded love ſaid <hi>Minerva,</hi> but that which is legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; all other affections being forbid, not only by divine but humane lawes. In which I'le ſpeake no more to him that teacheth others. A good cauſe defends it ſelfe; and one word is ſufficient in a truth, whereas a lye needs the ſupport of a large diſcourſe. Both of them ſpake againſt their conſcience, and contrary to their own beliefe; for this diſcourſe of <hi>Adraſte</hi> was quite averſe to what he thought, and <hi>Minerva's</hi> anſwer was no leſſe farre from her meaning. <hi>Adraſte</hi> deſiring to perſwade a woman that would be perſwaded, and whom he perceived to ſeeke ſome honeſt meanes that ſhe might love him without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, endeavoured by this talk to take from her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:396:35"/>
ſuch ſhame as naturally retaines all women. In which neretheleſſe he knew well that he did ill, but one ſo common amongſt men whoſe reaſons are overcome by appetite, as it ſeems cuſtome not onely renders them permitted, but authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Minerva</hi> ſpeaking truely according to her beliefe, ſtretched yet her thoughts unto ſuch things as ſhe might do, accompanying the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her words, with the quickning flames of her faire looks, drew by the gentleneſſe of her fweet charms, him that ſhe yet repulſed by the force of her ſtrong reaſons, to let him ſee the beauty of her minde, in the refuſing him that of her body, ſo as in yeelding both one and the other to him, he ſhould owe the favour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to her love then to her ignorance. And permitting him ſome ſmall privacies which did not much forbid the greater, as they ſeemed to promiſe unto him, cauſed him hope that ſhe would doe like the good wives, that often reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming what men aske of them, yet forbeare not to doe ſome part of their demands, but ſaying ſtill they will doe nought. Whileſt <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſo eagerly ſolicited <hi>Minerva, Braſsidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> both, came athwart his deſignes. <hi>Braſidas</hi> was a little of kinne to <hi>Minerva,</hi> but not ſo much, but he could have wiſhed to have been more neer. A man diſcreet, wiſe, ſubtile, and a boon compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, chiefly amongſt women. <hi>Gracchus</hi> was a little more earthy, and retained more of the Souldier, then of the Courtier, but neretheleſſe both of them brave Gentlemen, and both Lovers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:396:35"/>
of <hi>Minerva,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Adraſte</hi> firſt in time, and conſequently in right, however ſuch a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not alwaies neceſſary in affairs of love, where the laſt commers are many times firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, agreed both together to ruine him. The occaſion was offered them by the means of <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> one that <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſaw ſome times, and <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> likewiſe, however for divertiſement onely, and each ſingle without the other; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which they often met there; <hi>Gracchus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then one day with <hi>Aſteria,</hi> ſhe would needs know the newes of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and he knowing that ſhe knew not her, but through the report of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte,</hi> asked her again what he ſaid of her? <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> either to give him cauſe of jealouſie, or to make her ſelfe merry, ſaid that <hi>Adraſte</hi> did ſpeake all the good i'th world of her, but in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar he thought no longer of her. And that others might now with his free good will viſite her if they would, for he had taken his leave. <hi>Gracchus</hi> whether he beleeved her, or that he was well pleaſed to have ſuch an advantage on <hi>Adraſte,</hi> was ſo ſottiſh, or malitious, as to report again to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> for a truth, what the other had ſpoken in jeſt. And the ill fortune was, that <hi>Adraſte</hi> not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her of 3 or 4 dayes, ſhe was ſo weake to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it. The next day after <hi>Minerva</hi> having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to goe take the ayre with <hi>Braſsidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus,</hi> in the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> and having given them notice of the time ſhe would paſſe over the new Bridge, ſhe by chance met with <hi>Adraſte</hi> alone neere his lodging, that it may well be, thought

then of her, but not of the miſchiefe ſhe wiſhed him, nor of the charitable office was provided for him, from ſo far as ſhe could ſee him, ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, &amp; having cauſed him come into her coach, told him as they went, the cauſe ſhe had, or ſhe believed ſhe had, to be offended at his words. <hi>Adraſte</hi> judged preſently from whence it came, but he would ſay nothing behinde the backe of thoſe hee ſeemed the Authors of this impoſture, which were as he beleeved, <hi>Braſsidas</hi> and <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and by ſo much the leſſe he ſpake, by ſo much the more he ſeemed guilty, and to confeſſe it, ſo as <hi>Minerva</hi> extreamely offended at his words, took yet more offence at his ſilence by which he eſteemed to confirm them. <hi>Braſsidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> failed not of the time, at the place appointed by <hi>Minerva,</hi> but were preſently ſeene on horſeback at the lower end of the ſtreet <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> neer the new Bridge. <hi>Minerva</hi> offered them roome in her Coach, and they went both into one of the boots, <hi>Adraſte</hi> being with her in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They were ſcarſe ſet, before <hi>Gracchus</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him towards <hi>Adraſte;</hi> ſo Sir ſaid he, you have taken your leave, and parted with this Lady, for all which me thinks you are here ſtill: I ſtay Sir anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> to tell you, that is a tale, and nothing ſo. In ſaying which they being ſet back to back, one againſt the other, laid hand on their ſwords, <hi>Adraſte</hi> on that of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> on <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> which they drew neer halfe out. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> (and her mother that ſate at the end of the Coach) both ſhrieked out extreamely afrighted.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:396:36"/>
                  <hi>Braſsidas</hi> put himſelfe between them, the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtayed, and both of them ſate down againe without a blow ſtriking, out of their reſpect to <hi>Minerva,</hi> who was yet irreconcileably offended at the-ſmall regard they had had of her. She complained of wrong to the one and the other, and they both excuſed themſelves to her, defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their difference untill a fitter opportunity. But <hi>Braſsidas</hi> could not forbeare to tell <hi>Adraſte</hi> that he had done ill; <hi>Adraſte</hi> hearing ſuch words from him he eſteemed, and who was indeed part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly author of the quarrell, told him very hotly that he was none of his Iudge, and that he ſhould doe well to ſtay the medling in his cauſes, till they were brought before him. <hi>Braſsidas</hi> being before intereſſed in the buſineſſe for love of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> was now become ingaged on his own behalfe. Note either of them had a ſturdy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quay, and each of them a ſword, and that <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte</hi> had but a little boy who bore none with him neither; ſo as if they would have took their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the match had been ill made. The Coach drove along ſtrait to the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> whileſt <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> forethinking they would ſtrive who ſhould leade her at the going out of the Coach, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome worſe matter might yet ariſe in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, very privately charged and conjured <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> to take her mother, telling him that ſhe had had promiſed this day to walke with them, and that ſhee met him but by chance. <hi>Adraſte</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her, why if ſhe had made them ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhe called him along, and ſaid that ſince he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:396:37"/>
was firſt in time, if any one led her, it muſt be he. She then intreated him he would let her goe alone, and promiſed that none of the other ſhould leade her. <hi>Adraſte</hi> deeming it unfit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force her to ſuffer her ſelfe to be led againſt her will, agreed to that. And as ſhe came out of the Coach, every of them tendring his hand, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecht them leave her at liberty, ſaying ſhe was old enough to walke without help of a leader. Notwithſtanding, <hi>Adraſte</hi> kept cloſe on one ſide of her, and <hi>Braſsidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> on the other, without any one once offering to conduct <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,</hi> though ſhe had more need of their help then <hi>Minerva,</hi> not out of incivility, or want of courteſie, but through exceſſe of pride, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, fearing in leading the mother, they might ſeem to decline the daughter. They walked in this poſture ſo farre as the <hi>grande alley</hi> of the <hi>Tuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,</hi> and from thence as farre as the <hi>Echo. Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> interchanging ſome braving looks, aroſe, obſerved one another, not ſpeaking one word till they came to the end of the <hi>alley,</hi> when, the King entred at the other end; and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> that had ſhooke all this while, took <hi>Adraſte</hi> aſide whom ſhe had not ſpoken to ſince their comming into the Parke, more then to the reſt. And juſt the ſame feare a poor woman might have, (ſaid ſhe) to ſee two men of her company fight, have I to this minute had, not, but I thought ve had both ſufficient diſcretion to forbeare do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſuch diſcourteſie, but that I miſtruſted my ſelf of ſufficient merit to retain the violence of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:396:37"/>
your firſt motions, till now the Kings comming frees me from the feare, and you from the means to change blowes; I conjure thee <hi>Adraſte,</hi> by that great power which thou haſt made me beleeve I have in thee, not to trouble the delights we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in this daies walke with thy company. You have been ſufficiently troubleſome already, though I think innocently, ſo as I could wiſh that true was told me of you, and that I had not had the honour to meet you at all this day; not but your company is deere to me, that being the cauſe I intreat you now indeed to reſerve it for ſome other time; for now I cannot entertain you for feare of offending them, nor them for the ſame feare of offence to you. And this little time I ſpend with you, makes me doubt I have diſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them, ſince I know well you would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry to ſeem talke ſo long to them. <hi>Adraſte</hi> was no way agrieved at this diſcourſe, for having cleered himſelfe to <hi>Minerva,</hi> and driven his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to winde ward, hee was ſoon weary of the company, had loſt what ever could be called pleaſure in it, in the bitterneſſe of this diſpute, he deſired much to converſe with <hi>Minerva,</hi> but he as much ſhunned all common entertainments, as he ſought particular. The comming of the King took from him all cauſe of feare that he could be ſuſpected to ſhun their worſt of daring, being ſure they would do nothing in his preſence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, much leſſe to one they had not underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when he was alone: he gave <hi>Minerva</hi> then this anſwer; ſince I came not here without being
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:396:38"/>
called, it ſhall beſit me I conceive not to retire without your leave. Which ſince you haue ſo freely given me, I may well take, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your commands, goe hence, as by your ſummons I came hither. And more then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of obeying you, I too ſhall beare along with me the ſatisfaction to have cleered your doubts: and to have let you ſee, in my as freely parting, as addreſſe, that you have not leſſe power to abandon me, then to bring me to you. Yet I muſt here intreat you to acknowledge privately, the wrongs you have done me now in company, and in the evening, yet to honour me with that free entertainment of which I now deprive me willingly to obey. This day ſaid <hi>Minerva,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but to morrow will diſpoſe ſo of my affairs, as I will afford you two houres of the morning. <hi>Adraſte</hi> kiſſing her hands, made a low reverence to her mother, and went his way, haſting after the King, without ſalute, or once looking on <hi>Braſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidas</hi> or <hi>Gracchus.</hi> Having o'retaken the Court, he intreated the firſt friend he met, to take a turn with him, and leading him towards that ſide of the Parke where he had left <hi>Minerva,</hi> he told him; how he had been conſtrained to give ſome offenceto a couple of Gentlemen that had no juſt apprehenſion of it, or perhaps diſſembled their grudge, in reſpect to the company, or it might be for that they ſcorned to be two to one. That he had intreated him to walke this way with him, to the end that the others ſeeing them together, might have occaſion and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:396:38"/>
meanes to make a partie of two to two. And is it for this you tooke mee from my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the King, anſwered <hi>Oriſte?</hi> ſo was hee called, yes, ſaid <hi>Adraſte.</hi> There are ſuch fools in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the world, replyed <hi>Oriſte,</hi> amongſt whom I did little think you had had a place. And what in the Devils name have you to doe with them, did you not tell me even now that you had given them offence? It is true ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and I love not to give offence, but preſently I will give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. That is not amiſſe, indeed, if you will aske them pardon, anſwered <hi>Oriſte,</hi> or make them ſome other ſubmiſſion to repair the wrong you have done them. But you have not offended them as yet but in words, and you would wrong them now in deeds? you have but hurt them, and you would, kill them right out? and call it ſatisfaction, and reparation of honour? It belongs to them to repair the injury you have done them, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you a greater wrong, words, by the lie, the lie by a box on the eare, and a box of the eare by bloud or death. But you have wronged them, and would give ſatisfaction by increaſing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and repair your fault by rendring it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irrepairable. As for me, it is a philoſophy of the times I underſtand not. Stay till they come to us, and we will talk with them, but to goe ſeek them, is to run to meet a mans miſhap, and for pleaſure to throw ones ſelfe head-long downe a precipice. True ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> but you know a common error makes a law, and wee are now a days governed more by the examples of fools,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:396:39"/>
then by the reaſons of the wiſe? In ſaying which they paſſed and repaſſed acroſſe the wood, into the ſame walk, where <hi>Minerva</hi> was, between the hands of <hi>Braſidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus, Adraſte</hi> ſaluting <hi>Arlande,</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> not ſo much as looking on the others, and they reſaluting alſo without the others obſerving it. The next morn <hi>Adraſte</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a challenge very early, and having ſtayed till eight of the clock in his lodging hee came by that time ſhee roſe to <hi>Minerva's,</hi> where hee was ſcarce entred, but one told <hi>Minerva;</hi> that <hi>Braſidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> were at the door. Tell them I am not well, ſaid <hi>Minerva,</hi> and that I deſire them to hold me excuſed, that I cannot accept the honor they do me. Let it not be ſo, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> for my boy attends me below, by whom they may know I am heer. What ſhall wee do then, ſaid <hi>Minerva?</hi> I would you were all at ſeverall ends of the World, farre enough from hence, &amp; where my head might ſcape breaking in your quarrels. Madame, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> yee ought yet diſtinguiſh between the innocent, and the faulty; It was not I cauſed the jarre, you know beſt what is now to be done, you prayed mee yeſterday to retire for the love of them, you may to day pray them to retire for the love of me. And if you ſhould wiſh them never come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, after the knowledge you now have of their malice, it were but juſtly done. Sir, ſaid <hi>Arlande, Braſsidas</hi> is my kinſman, I, nor my daughter can well forbid him the houſe, nor thoſe he bringeth a long with him. But go tell them ſaid ſhe to one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:396:39"/>
of her ſervants, that my daughter is at maſſe, and that I am buſie heere with <hi>Adraſte. Arlande</hi> ſaid this, well knowing they looked not for her, and that the ready way to return them, was to ſay her daughter was not within. There was three or four Churches thereabouts, to all which they went, and <hi>Minerva</hi> thinking with her ſelf they would not fail to go thither, and not finding her, they would come back to her houſe, was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted; for that ſhee would not refuſe them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or deny her ſelfe to them twice together in one day, and to turn off <hi>Adraſte,</hi> it was out of all likelihood. When ſhe was once ready, he would have waited her to the Church, but ſhe excuſed herſelf, and ſtole privatly from him to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, leaving him with <hi>Arlande,</hi> who told <hi>Adraſte</hi> what a ſhame it would be to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if her coſen ſhould finde him with her in the ſtreet, in ſtead of being at Church, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune might follow, if <hi>Graccus</hi> choller or his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhould ſo o're-rule him, as now in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to take ſatisfaction of the injury done him, which the day before he had for the love of her diſſembled. <hi>Adraſte</hi> did not trouble himſelf to anſwer her, but taking his leave, followed <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> from Church to Church, and while he ſought her in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Braſsidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi> found her in the other; and ſhe found no leſſe pain to diſmiſſe them, then ſhe had had to rid her of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> for they importuned her no leſſe to wait her backe from Church, then he had to bring her thither.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:396:40"/>
But at laſt ſhe eſcaped them, and returned as ſhe went, after having drawn a promiſe from <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> that he ſhould not call <hi>Adraſte</hi> to account for any thing that had paſt the day before. In the meane time <hi>Adraſte</hi> returned very diſcontented at <hi>Minerva,</hi> it ſeemed to him that ſhe having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him an entertainment to day, ſhould not have left him as ſhe had, to finde out his enemies; and that ſhe was not ſtoln away ſo much for any devotion ſhe had to Church, as for the deſire ſhe had to ſee them there. But next day he was much more troubled, thinking to goe make his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, when they told him ſhe was gone out to walk with them. Then preſently conceived he the plot was not combined againſt him, but with her counſell and aſſent, and that ſhe had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved, but deſigned it. And ſo returning backe, his breſt fraught with more deſpight then love, and not ſo much reaſon as rage, after having reſolved now to breake with her once for all, he wrote to her,</p>
               <p>THat as hee had pitied her weakneſſe, ſeeing ſhee ſuffered her ſelfe to be rather perſwaded by paſsion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the part of his Enemies then by the truth of his words; ſo hee received no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to ſee that for his having cheered himſelf before them, and for ever being too d ſcreet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfull on her behalf, and at her inſtance on theirs, he was now deprived of what they poſſeſſed for having been the contrary. That the time had been when this privation now ſo eaſie to undergo, had been moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:396:40"/>
for him to believe; but conſidering that of all things that moſt provoked him, and the chiefeſt cauſe of his vexation and worſt tormenting paſsions, it was eaſie for him to endure the loſſe of a good, the poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherof was ſo extremly damageable. Wherfore he would now as with a ſponge wipe off the fair impreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he had formerly admitted in his memory, and hee intreated her to favour him ſo farre, as not to oblige him ever by the replacing them. Hee avow'd it the mediate will of Heaven, without which hee had beene as unable 'to execute, as raſh in undertaking this deſigne. For which hee only was to thank her ingratitude, that thinking to work him ſo much ill, had been the cauſe of ſo great good to him. And that he did beſeech her by this laſt, and by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo many vowes, no leſſe religious, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, which hee moſt fooliſhly had rendred her, that henceforth ſhee would never more call them to minde; aſſuring her he ſhould eſteem him fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all his ſervices, when he ſhould finde they were forgot, and that ſhe held them ſo indifferent, that hee had never cauſe to joy in or complain of them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat delight ſoever the company afforded, could not be ſo pleaſant to <hi>Minerva,</hi> as this Letter was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her. But howſoever ſhe took it extreamly ill from <hi>Adraſte,</hi> ſhe would not yet looſe him ſo. No though ſhe knew not to what purpoſe to reſerve him, for ſhe had ſufficiently manifeſted the little good will ſhe bore him. But there are ſome women that delight themſelves to render all men amorous of them, and they affecting none. Or it may be ſhe held this maxime of the wiſe, that ſay a man ſhould not breake with friends, no not for any cauſe whatſoever, for that ſuch as are unfit for one thing, may yet ſerve to another, and it may be ſhe intended to accommodate her ſelfe by <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte</hi> to ſome other purpoſe. Whatſoever it were, ſhe forbore to anſwer his Letter till her choler was paſt over, nor wrote ſhe to him then; but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:396:41"/>
paſſing ſome daies after by his lodging, ſhe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be told, that there was a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the ſtreet asked for him. <hi>Adraſte</hi> came down, and <hi>Minerva</hi> made him come into her Coach, where ſhe was then accompanied onely with one gentlewoman, and going to take the aire. She told him that ſhe had not anſwered his Letters, for that ſhee could not bethink her of termes ſufficiently powerfull to make him ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of her anger. So then Madame, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> if you have not given me offence, I ſtand not obliged to you for it, but your ill memory, that had not means to find words ſufficiently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, to expreſſe the offence you intended mee; Tis true ſaid ſhee, but you are a naughty man to write ſuch Letters to mee. And you are then a naughty woman, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> to inforce mee to it by ſo many juſt and rightfull cauſes as you have. If I have given you ſuch, replyed ſhe, and have ſo little reaſon in my actions, why have you ſo little judgment in your love; you have leſſe reaſon then mee to love one that hath none at all, and by the extravagance of your unfound minde, accuſe me of your own defaults. Madam, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> I have cauſed you to ſee moſt cleerly that you are in the wrong, ſince you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde meanes to anſwer my Letters; But how ſhould you finde reaſons, that could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed finde the offence. Wherby it follows that being you have done the wrong, you cannot have reaſon on your ſide, ſince wrong and reaſon cannot be united in one ſubject. And yet cry you
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:396:42"/>
that I am reaſonleſſe, to love one that hath none. I anſwer you that though I am reaſonleſſe, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not but you are ſo likewiſe, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without denying but I was my ſelf ſo; And on the contrary, I have always endevoured to let you ſee that I had litle reaſon in me, ever to ſhew that I had ſo much love for you. Since if I had, I could not have loved you, or at leaſt but in ſuch ſort as I had been loved again of you. And if you were reaſonable, you would love mee as I love you. See then wherfore I love you in two ſorts, (without reaſon) firſt, for that you are reaſonleſſe, ſecondly, becauſe I am ſo alſo. As to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances of my diſeaſed minde, I apprehend them to my own advantage. Remember you what I have ever ſaid, that my weakneſſes, and failings were the things that I deſired to cauſe you ſee. Tis well I am there arrived. <hi>Minerva</hi> fell a laughing at theſe words, and as particular complaints do uſually ſucceed the generall; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> complain'd of her, for that when hee had left his entertainment to his enemies, upon her promiſe to afford him one more private, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, ſhe had not onely turned him off to her mother <hi>Arlande,</hi> but her ſelf had ſtoln away from him to go to them, had depriv'd him of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her company, and conduct, to afford it unto them, and had wronged a man whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was ſo known to her, therby to favour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whoſe malice was to her no leſſe manifeſt. <hi>Minerva</hi> excuſed her on the juſt fear ſhee might have of the bloudy effects their quarrell might
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:396:42"/>
have produced; ſaid that the ſame fear had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her not to ſuffer him to lead her; and that ſhe had alſo denied it unto them: And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry having found <hi>Braſidas &amp; Gracchus</hi> at Church, ſhee had prayed them, not onely to forbeare to lead her, but to ſee her. Notwithſtanding that <hi>Braſidas</hi> being ſince come to ſee <hi>Arlande</hi> as his Kinſwoman, and <hi>Gracchus</hi> accompanying him as his friend, ſhe could not hinder the Viſitations, nor the Walks <hi>Arlande</hi> admitted of, it being very uncomly for the daughter, to play the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris before her mother; not thinking alſo that it would have becomm'd a woman of her quality, to teſtifie the leaſt animoſity againſt them, at all to ſhew ſhe affected him. In the end ſhe knew ſo well to plead her cauſe, as ſhe gained her ſuite; <hi>Adraſte</hi> asked pardon, and the wronged party made the amends. This day conſumed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and ſuch like ſatisfactions, took yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all hate that the laſt falling out ſeemed to have ingendred in their hearts, how ever it placed not there the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted love (not in that of <hi>Minerva's</hi> for that ſhe yet mourned for the dead, on whoſe behalf ſhe ſeemed even to deſpiſe her life. Nor in that of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> for that ſeeking in theſe diſgraces to ſave him from the ambuſhes of <hi>Minerva,</hi> hee was already faln in thoſe of <hi>Cariclea,</hi> which hee would have diſſembled, but <hi>Minerva</hi> intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to helpe her looſe the remembrance of a man whom ſhee had loved, hee againe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of her adviſe how to acquire the affection of a woman that he adored. You have already ſo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:396:43"/>
acquired her, anſwered <hi>Minerva,</hi> thinking he had ſpake of her ſelf, as you need not care further but of means to preſerve her. Would to God that he you love were alive ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and that I were in poſſeſſion of her I deſire, I believe I ſhould have leſſe trouble to preſerve then I ſhall have to acquire her. How can that be, ſaid <hi>Minerva,</hi> that you ſhould be in poſſeſſion of her you deſire, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of him I lament, if you deſire not ſome other then me? And how think you alſo that it can be believed, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that I have acquired the affections of one, that lives not but in the death of an other? I have the wrong indeed on my ſide ſaid <hi>Minerva,</hi> and you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on yours. <hi>Adraſte,</hi> to engage your thoughts upon ſuch an object, as hath not ingaged theirs; But ſince I diſcover thus my malady to you, if ſo you cannot give me help, as there is none in death, I pray at leaſt refuſe me not your comfort, and be it ſo that in loſing you for a Lover, I may enjoy you as a friend. Madam, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> it hath bin the greateſt unhappineſſe that hath done me outrage, to ſee how unapt you have bin to think the one or the other of me: But I ſhall never ceaſe to be both, to you, ſo long as God ſhall give me life, and you no cauſe to die by the ill uſe you daily do me. The night book of their diſcourſe, which elſe they had not known how to leave. <hi>Minerva</hi> having prepared to retire to her houſe in the Country, and apprehending in the ſolitude that place offered, the ſorrows that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolphes</hi> death did now make her ſo lively feel in

the divertiſements of this ſo excellent City, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain conjured <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that did ſometimes apply him to ſuch things, to write ſomewhat in way of conſolation, and in verſe, on the death of <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,</hi> an importune requeſt to pray a Lover, to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie himſelf in the commendations of a Rival; and the more for that <hi>Adraſte</hi> medled but unwillingly in making Verſes, ſeeing ſo many as he did, come off with little credit in that ſubject. But <hi>Arnolphe</hi> was dead, and hee hoped in pray ſing him, hee ſhould at leaſt flatteringly ſooth his Miſtris, and inſenſibly inſinuate in her favours, yet the more; unwilling to give the repulſe to a Lady, to whom he had given himſelf, without whom he could not reſt, and with whom he could not live, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to render him pleaſing and agreeable ſo far as to celebrate for her the affections of him that living had orethrown his own. So after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought <hi>Minerva</hi> home to her houſe, and being retired to his own lodging, hee made the ſame Evening the following <hi>Stanzaes,</hi> as you ſee, which the next morning he ſent to her at her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, to let her ſee with how much care and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe hee did imbrace all manner of occaſion, did at all pertain unto her ſervice.

                  <p>Theſe Verſes mortified not ſo many flames in the breſt of <hi>Minerva,</hi> as they produced teares in her fair eys; &amp; this cure was one of thoſe that ſtir up much more grief, then they appeaſe. Yet mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ſhee at the ſtrength of <hi>Adraſtes</hi> affection, which had born him to a complyance ſo contrary to his paſſion, and how ſoever ſhee was extremly ingrate, ſhee could not help it, but ſhe found her ſelf extremly obliged to him in it. But her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome few days after, did quickly efface this ſmall good will. Yet ſhe ſaw <hi>Adraſte</hi> once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee went, thanked him of his pains in her comforts, and left him more affection then ſhee carried away with her. For ſhee was then moſt ſtedfaſtly allied to the firſt object of her love: And <hi>Adraſte</hi> hung ſo even between the affections of <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Cariclea,</hi> that they called him the Knight of the cloven hart. A little time after ſome Princes of <hi>France</hi> took armes, pretending reformation of the State, and comfort of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom the Souldiers much ſolaced, by the diſcharging them of whatſoever they were able
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:396:45"/>
to carry away for them, <hi>Tatius</hi> that had ſo well managed the affairs of his houſe, would now needs meddle with the government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſeeking ſo to readvance his private fortunes upon the publique, took part with them. The ſmall number of men that were of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, cauſed that they not onely imbraced him, but renewed the luſter of his ancient titles, by the glitter of a new dignity, making him chief of the Councell of that faction, and not putting him in leſſer hopes then of the Seals of <hi>France.</hi> He took this occaſion to follow ſome means of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his wife, whom he diſpoſed therto ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily for the part ſhee pretended to in the hopes of her husbands fortunes: And <hi>Tatius</hi> ſought her the rather for the need he had of her aſſiſtance; for although he were not ſetled in his new office, he needed mony for his uſe in it, which he knew not how to raiſe, but on the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Minerva,</hi> who freely became bound for him, deceived in the hopes of this falſe proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fortune was not ſo favourable to him as ſhee promiſed: for that ſuch as had armed for the State, and Republique, comming to a Treaty, uſed not a word but of their owne particular intereſts; and left not the people onely more miſerable, more ruined then ever; but alſo <hi>Tatius</hi> diſcharged of his Office, and his wife burthened with part of his debts. This laſt affection of <hi>Minerva</hi> being founded on the hope of advantage, could endure no longer then the foundation; ſo as that was no ſooner
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:396:46"/>
ruin'd, but this fell to the ground, and <hi>Tatius</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> to as ill intelligence and accord as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; which brought her backe very ſodainly to <hi>Paris. Adraſte</hi> failed not to go ſee her ſo ſoone as he knew ſhe was come; But in her abſence the affections of <hi>Cariclea,</hi> had ſo occupied his heart, as it ſeemed there was ſmall roome left for the reeſtabliſhing thoſe of <hi>Minerva.</hi> And beſides diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention being as it were inſeparable and ever fatal to the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> where calmes doe but preſage the following ſtormes, and where thoſe ſtormes are never calmed but in the occaſion of greater and more furious ones, and chiefly in the youth and firſt yeares of their kings; This laſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion was not ſo ſoon appeaſed, but there aroſe an other by ſo much the more to be feared, as the pretext, and cauſe was more honorable in ſhew &amp; plauſible to moſt. Which obliging the king to make an excurſion into <hi>Normandy</hi> to aſſure him that Province, conſequently obliged <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> to follow him, who a more faithfull ſubject then a Lover, preferred his ſenſe of honour, and courage to his apprehenſion of his amorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Hee let him proceed as far as <hi>Roane</hi> yet, and then to <hi>Deepe.</hi> But hearing hee intended to put himſelfe into <hi>Cain,</hi> where the Caſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſelfe againſt the City, and the City for his Majeſty againſt the Caſtle; he ſhould have been exceeding ſorry not to have beene at the firſt place, which the King had ever yet in his owne perſon beleaguered. He left then <hi>Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Caricha,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where his deſires, &amp; eaſe, would
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:396:46"/>
ſtill have detained him, and made all diligent haſte to travailes, to paines, and perills, where his devoire did call him. The hiſtory of this ſiege not being our ſubject, it ſhall ſuffice to let you know that the good fortunes, providence, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and diligence of the King conquered him, this place, in leſſe then three dayes. And three daies after al that great Province which gave him meanes, and leiſure to prevent his enemies, as we hope to make it appeare elſewhere more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſeeing the warre ended on this ſide, before any man had once meanes to give notice of his abilities in the leaſt meaſure, and the King to take the way to <hi>Manns,</hi> tooke that to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> without other cauſe then to ſee his two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, by whom he was variably agitated; He lov'd them both not onely through his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meerly, but alſo with deſigne, to the end the one ſhould hinder him to give himſelfe wholy to the other, that his ſufferance ſhould be by ſo much the leſſe as it ſhould be divided; and by ſo much the better moderated as it ſhould bee the leſſe. An excellent remedy in affaires of love, had not his too perfect fidelity hindred him to put it in practiſe, for that he ſerved himſelf as then moſt happily with it. And after having ſometimes ſeene one, and ſometimes the other, he quit them both againe to look out the king, that was as then at <hi>Manns</hi> with his armie. The departure of <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte,</hi> the abſence of <hi>Braſsidas</hi> and <hi>Gracchus;</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of <hi>Tatius,</hi> and death of <hi>Arnolphe</hi> gave <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> opportunity, who was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:396:47"/>
to renew his affection with <hi>Minerva,</hi> but ſo far onely as the tearmes of a common wel-wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Adraſte</hi> having found a gentleman of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance called <hi>Chabrias,</hi> a man of great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and no ſmall execution, who being married ſome three or foure dayes before; had left thoſe lawful pleaſures of a bridegroom, to embrace the travailes of warre, met neere <hi>Manns</hi> an other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,</hi> who tould them hee had found ſome Thirty Commanders about two or three leagues from thence, which it was ſayd were of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies party. <hi>Adraſte</hi> and <hi>Chabrias</hi> had over taken &amp; left behinde them a company of ſouldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Queen, that were to joyne with the kings army. They then intreated this <hi>Cavalier</hi> to adviſe them of their intentions, and pray their Captaines to follow them a gallope, whileſt they went on before. The gentleman failed not to give them the ſame adviſe, and the company ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overtaken them at a ſmall Village where they ſtayed for guides, they put themſelves in front, and went forwards altogether to a great Towne where theſe people lay intrenched. But they found they belongd to the King, and that they had but travailed themſelves and their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in vaine, eſpecially <hi>Adraſte,</hi> who being hurt ſometime before in the legge, drew ſuch ſtore of groſſe humors to the part diſeaſed, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion of this poſt, as it became almoſt ſo bigge as his head. There is a fine houſe neere <hi>Manns,</hi> and I dare ſay the moſt beautifull, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull of the Country, the owner whereof
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:396:47"/>
was brother in law to <hi>Chabrias,</hi> a perfect gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>Adraſtes</hi> hurt conſtrained him to ſtay there, though in the abſence of <hi>Chabrias,</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had both followed the king to <hi>Flesche,</hi> but there was a Lady whoſe vertues obliged him no leſſe to celebrate her memory, then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which ſince tooke her in the prime and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of her youth, conſtraineth all ſuch as have ſeen her to lament her death. She was a ſummary of wiſedome with beauty. The abridgement of all humane perfections in a woman, and the mirror of her ſex. <hi>Adraſte</hi> having rather aſſwaged the ſorenes of his wound, then perfectly heald it, by the reſt and good uſage he found in this ſo ſweet a retreate, parted from thence upon an adviſe he received that the King would be gon with all ſpeed from <hi>Flesche,</hi> and came thither before the departure of his Majeſty; But ſo ill diſpoſed as he had like to have dyed. He fell very happily yet into the hands of a Chirurgion, not a leſſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, then an honeſt man, who alwaies dreſſed him with ſingular dexterity, but he could not be ſo ſoone healed, for that the accompliſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended not ſo much on the Chirurgions reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the repoſe of his perſon. And the King marching directly to <hi>Pont de Se, Adraſte</hi> ſayd as <hi>Pompey</hi> once, It is neceſſary that I go, but not that I live; Lets away, no danger ſhall ſtay me; And eaſing his legge in a ſcarfe, he got on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe the next day after the Armie diſlodged, roade in one day as farre as that had marched in two, and with ſo good hap as he was there time
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:396:48"/>
enough to looſe his horſe that was ſlaine under him, in the entrenchment the enemie had made before the bridge. This was a mervailous glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dayes worke to the King, to whoſe name (after God) we may impute the affright that ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the heart of his enemies; and honourable to all ſuch as endeavoured to become remarkeable therein: Amongſt whom <hi>Nereſtan</hi> was none of the leaſt, commanding that day as Marſhall of the Field, who got a muſquet breach through the thigh, whereof not long after he dyed. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre ſuch to the hiſtory, as would ſee the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the taking of that place; but will ſay by the way, it being no part of my ſubject, that ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Perdus,</hi> backt with three Regiments, trode un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoot three Thouſand men intrenched, and gain'd the bridge which needed but to have been drawn to have ſtayed them. That they were but thirteen which at the firſt entred the City, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there was at the leaſt thirty or forty Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Enemie which iſſued, without thoſe of our part ſo much as daring to ſpeake to them becauſe of their weakeneſſe, nor they to ours, by reaſon of the affright they were in. That more then ſixty of their ſouldiers, ſhut themſelves up in the Caſtle, and one of ours amognſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was not known till the next day. The Leaders of the <hi>Perdus</hi> were <hi>Maliſsy,</hi> and dead <hi>Maſsott</hi> Leftenants of the Gards; the latter ſlaine ſince at <hi>Clayrac.</hi> The Volentiers found with them in the Citty were amongſt others, the Barons of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Monrial,</hi> with three gallant Souldiers of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:396:48"/>
that <hi>Adraſte</hi> met upon the way with <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut;</hi> and but for the hurt of his leg, and loſſe of his horſe, that tooke from him all meanes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, he had beene companion of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I have through the default of my memory, loſt the names of the two firſt, which hath indeed cauſed me do the like by others: The third was called <hi>Albanas</hi> a yong gentleman of ſome Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or twenty yeares of age, who ſeeing a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant of the Guards conteſt upon the command <hi>Maliſsy</hi> had given him, to paſſe the bridge to get helpe from the King ſwame the river of <hi>Loire</hi> by night, and went to Mounſieur <hi>Crequi,</hi> who ſent Mounſieur <hi>Miraumonts</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany thither. The king loſt not in this day any gentleman of quality but <hi>Marais,</hi> and two yong gentlemen of the Guards, whoſe names have eſcaped me, Of the enemie that were loſt there, a man cannot well ſay the number, for that the affright forced them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the river, which drowned the moſt of them. But the next day there were buried ſome hundred or ſixſcore of the ſlaine bodies. The Earle of <hi>Saintagnan</hi> was there taken priſoner, the Marqueſſe <hi>Focillere,</hi> and the Viſcount of <hi>Betan-Court,</hi> honourably wounded each of them in the arme with a pike. The feare and aſtoniſhment was ſo great, that the King talking after to the Baron of <hi>Meilam</hi> in <hi>Briſas. Adraſte</hi> being by, told him that a poore fellow finding a horſeman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and armed at all parts in a ditch, tooke from him not only his Armes &amp; horſe, but his cloaths alſo, and left him there ſtark naked. A great many
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:396:49"/>
of people were ill lodged there this night, and <hi>Adraſte</hi> in particular, who having no leſſe angred his hurt by his labour in the fight, then by his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile on the way, had the cold Aire for his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall entertainment, the heavens for a covering, and the earth for a Couch, and all for want of knowing his friends quarter, and the meanes to carry him thither had he knowne it, having loſt in the diſorder two Laquays, and a couple of horſes that he left behind him. But amid ſo many wants, and incommodities he had water enough, of which he dranke plentifully at the expence of the river of <hi>Loire,</hi> on whoſe banke he paſſed the night of one of the longeſt dayes of Summer, more cooly then he had the precedent day, but amongſt the dead &amp; wounded bodies, or people gathered together on all ſides, in whom he had no knowledge, or truſt. The next day he found his horſes with one of his footmen, who had look'd every where for him, not leſſe eſtrayed then himſelfe, having loſt his companion that was never ſeene ſince: And the king being gone to lodge in the Caſtle that had render'd the ſame day, and the lodgings being all diſpoſed off in the City, and Suburbs, though none to <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that had no body to ſend to demaund it, and was too much buſied to go himſelfe, for having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the night without ſleepe, and the day before without meate, he no ſooner found his Laquay, but he ſent him for Proviſion to the firſt Cooks: and having aſſwaged his extreame hunger, paſſed the moſt part of that day in the ſhade under a tree
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:396:49"/>
beneath which he had taken his repaſt, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the travaile he had undergone, the want of ſleepe, and the griefe of his wound forced him to give to reſt, ſuch time as others imployed to lodge themſelves, by the ſame meanes letting his horſes take their reſt, and feed, that had no leſſe need of it then himſelfe. But when he ſaw it grew late, and that the heavens covered with clouds (whoſe thundring and lightnings threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the earth with a ſodaine ſtorme) cauſed him to fear another night worſe then that he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he got on horſe-back to goe to the Caſtle, well hoping that if ſo be he could not finde any officer to lodge him, it was impoſſible but hee ſhould light on ſome friend with whom he might retire. But it was alreadie darke before he came there, each man toiled with the labour of the day precedent, was retir'd betimes. The King himſelfe was in bed, and the Guard of the bodie had already accommodated their couches at his chamber doore. He could have wiſhed to have laine amongſt them, but his horſes were abroad with his Laquay, and the feare to be denied, the Scotch in <hi>France</hi> being none of the moſt curteous of the world, though he had the honour to be the Kings ſervant, cauſed him that he choſe rather to ſuffer what ever ill might happen to him, then the ſhame of being repulſed. Having ſtaied then till the Captain of the Guard of the body, would ſhut in the Caſtle gates, he went out, it being night; and one ſo dark as a man could not ſee but by the beames of the lightning in it: and for his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:396:50"/>
better comfort, it rained ſo faſt as there was not any man left in the ſtreets; So as when <hi>Adraſte</hi> was got out he found not his man or horſes wher he left them. Was not this cripple finely overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? he called, he hallowed, and made ſuch a noyſe, as ſome Souldiers as were got to covert under the pent-houſe or a long the ſtreets, told him that there was a boy a ſleepe betweene two horſes, that neither winde, raine, nor thunder had power to wake. He groped out his way thether, and having rouſed his youth, got on horſebacke, not onely deſpairing to finde lodging, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge where to looke it. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being extreamely a dry, and thinking theſe Souldiers could likelyer ſhew him a drinking place, then a lodging, he prayed them to direct him to ſome Inne where he might drinke a cup. They carried him to the <hi>White-Croſse,</hi> where <hi>Mounſieur</hi> the Kings brother, his followers lay. <hi>Adraſte</hi> perceiving it was the <hi>Mounſieurs</hi> quarter, hee conceived hope of finding ſome curteſie there. There were many people before the gate, ſome deſiring to go in, and others calling for wine, who gave way to him. <hi>Adraſte</hi> comming neere the gate which was ſhut, and deſiring to ſpeak with ſome of the <hi>Mounſieurs</hi> gentlemen, he was ſo bleſſed that one of his friends that was within knew his voice: but not ſo well but hee asked him his name for better aſſurance. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that knew not to whom he ſpak, you will know me better by face then name, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me ſo much as to open the gate, and you will
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:396:50"/>
ſee I am the Kings ſervant. At laſt he was forced to ſay it was <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and at that name they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doore, cauſed him to enter, and they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him. <hi>Adraſte</hi> entred not as into an Inne, but a Paradiſe, raviſhed with a contentment by ſo much the greater as he had little hoped it. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe,</hi> ſo was this friend called that let him in, cauſed a bed to be made for him, for though ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per were ready, they perceived well that he had more need of repoſe, then a repaſt. But there could be ſpared but one Chamber onely where <hi>Mounſieur de Vendoſme,</hi> having made it his kitchin but two dayes before, had left ſuch an infection as a man could ſcarce endure the ill ſmell. But it being a happineſſe to be within there, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the ill weather abroad, and a greater to have a bed, where others lay on benches, he layd him downe. There is nothing like neceſſity to give a value to things, nor doe things ſo appeare or are eſteemed but by their contraries. Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deem nothing like liberty of which they are deprived, and which they neglect when they may enjoy it. <hi>Adraſte</hi> could not have beleeved there had been ſuch felicity to lodge in a ſtinking kitchin, which he would not once have lookt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to at another time, if the misfortune, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein hee was become had not cauſed him finde the difference between reſt and labour, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and ſurety. His horſes and Laquay lay and ſupped in <hi>Freſco</hi> with divers others in a Garden that was on the backſide of the Inne. On the morrow after having thanked his hoſts, he went
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:396:51"/>
to ſeek the Harbinger, that bilited him in the Suburbs of Saint <hi>Martins</hi> right againſt <hi>Chabrias,</hi> and neer the bridge, and ſufficiently commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. Scarce had hee entred his Lodging, but one habited like a Souldier, having ſaluted him in the ſtreet, entreated harbour of him. There is a certaine kinde of fate, that cauſes misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes often to encounter their like. <hi>Adraſte</hi> obſerved this man with compaſſion, ſeeing him in ſuch a caſe as himſelfe was but lately; had he been hurt, daſhed in the rain, or in the darke of night, as hee was. My friend, ſaid hee, it is not long ſince, that if you had requeſted this of mee, I could very hardly have done it you, but having now meanes, and knowing the wants that you are in by that I have ſuffered my ſelf, I ſhall be very loath to put you off, though I know not who you are. Sir, anſwered the other, I am ſuch a one, who have ſeen you in <hi>Paris</hi> with ſuch a one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and comming now out of <hi>Italie,</hi> I am very inconſiderately faln into this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, endevouring to follow the Court with a friend, untill the King ſhould return to <hi>Paris. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> looking him more neer in the face remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it was a Merchant whom hee had ſeen mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>Paris,</hi> to a faire Gentlewoman, for whoſe love, and of a brothers ſhe had of excellent wit, hee became yet more obliged to pleaſure him; ſo as hee not onely afforded him the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation hee intreated, but hee took him a long with him as far as <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> where leaving him till their return from <hi>Bearne,</hi> hee afterwards
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:396:51"/>
accompanied him ſo farre as <hi>Saintis,</hi> But this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of <hi>Adraſte</hi> nothing to the ſubject of my Diſcourſe, hath made me ſtray a little from the affections of <hi>Minerva,</hi> which now let me again reſume.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King having appeaſed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order on this ſide <hi>Loire,</hi> turned head towards another, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe about <hi>Garonne,</hi> after having made ſome ſmall ſtay about the <hi>Clain.</hi> And having ſetled peace in <hi>Guien,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as farre a s <hi>Bearne,</hi> where he put in execution the decree he had made four yeers before againſt the <hi>Hugonauts,</hi> in favour of the Eccleſiaſtiques, and then returned in all glory to his chief City. But that belongs to the Hiſtory of <hi>France,</hi> and not at all to ours. Nor have we ſpoke of it but to avoid a more tedious diſcourſe which muſt have beene made to continue the adventures of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte,</hi> whoſe particular return comprehending
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:396:52"/>
in the generall, we have not now to ſay, but that having ſtill followed the Court, hee came there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to <hi>Paris,</hi> where from the morrow of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall he was taken with a quoridian Fever which brought him ſo low, as it was not hoped he could ever get up again. He had the help of an excellent Phyſician in his art, a worthy man, his intimate and perfect friend, to whoſe care and goodneſſe, next under God, hee ſtands obliged for his life. Amongſt his viſitants <hi>Minerva</hi> was one, that came to ſee him, not onely contrary to his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, but his hope alſo, for the continuance of his abſence, the travail of the journey, and moſt of all the violence of his ſickneſſe, had ſo efaced all impreſſions of his love, as there remayned not ſo much as any line or draught therof in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. He was not in the height of his diſeaſe, but in the greateſt weaknes of his perſon, ſo as when his Fever ſomewhat ceaſed on the one ſide, it ſeems that this viſit prepared for him a new cauſe to re-alight his affection on the other. But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſited more by <hi>Chariclea,</hi> then by <hi>Minerva,</hi> the aſſaults and batteries of the one, ruined and oreturned even to the ground whatſoever the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther erected. Reaſon and Civility willed that hee being well ſhould ſee ſuch as had viſited him ſick. Of which he acquit him very religiouſly to all, but <hi>Minerva</hi> whom he ſaw not, in doubt that freeing him of one malady, he might fall into an other, by ſo much the more to be feared, as thoſe of the minde are generally more dangerous than they of the body. Contempt is the greateſt vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:396:53"/>
to a high minde, eſpecially when it comes from ſuch of whom they have made eſteeme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or from whom they have been accuſtomed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honour and reſpect. <hi>Minerva</hi> having been ſo perfectly honoured of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure without deſpight, that he that had not liv'd but in her, and for her, and of the life, and health of whom, ſhe had teſtified ſo great a care, ſhould viſit all ſuch as had ſeen him but her ſelf. And her indignation was by ſo much the greater, for that ſhe knew he faild not in this duty for want of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, nor of knowledge. He offends not, ſaid ſhe, of ignorance, but contempt, and believed that it was of purpoſe. In the end <hi>Adraſte</hi> muſt needs go ſee her, for ſhee had ſent ſo often to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it had bin diſcourteſie, and ingratitude to have done otherwiſe. She congratulated his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, ſhe civilly complained of his incivility, and pray'd him not onely to ſee her, but alſo to write unto her. <hi>Adraſte</hi> well ſaw that theſe were ſo many ſnares ſet by <hi>Minerva</hi> for his liberty; but hee had ſcarce power to refuſe a thing which he had firſt demanded of her, had he not bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. And as love is an Enemy not to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, but by the abſence of the thing beloved, very hardly could hee avoid being overcome by ſuch approaches as theſe were. Two ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits wrought in his thoughts, like two contrary winds at Sea, with a periſhing veſſell; the moſt violent which was yet moſt pleaſing, counſelled, and almoſt conſtrained him againſt his will to love this woman, the other more gentle, and yet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:396:53"/>
more troubleſome, did utterly forbid it. And as his imaginations figured to him the matchleſſe delights he might gather from the paſſion of ſuch beauties; his memory again preſented to him the moſt affrightfull torments he was ſure to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer but pretending therunto; and the divers ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks he had undergone in the ſame Port, did counſell him in any wiſe, not now to re-imbarke him there. But the means likewiſe for him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, (he that lov'd not his own eys without it were for ſeeing her, in whom he had already har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured the chiefe felicities of his life) was away. In this conflict of difficulties hee addreſſed him unto her ſelf, as ſole and ſovereigne Arbiter of his thoughts, beg'd of her to reſtore them back the reſt ſhe had bereft them off, and to render to her ſelf the ſame contentment, which her cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had raviſhed from him, in outraging the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Lover, and betraying her own proper deſires, through the ingratefull miſacknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherby ſhe did receive his pure affections. As <hi>Minerva</hi> had bin provoked and agreed at the indifference of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> ſhe was now well pleaſed to ſee him ſtirred again with love of her. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſcreetand ſubtile woman chiefly in the art of faining, in which ſhe out-went the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite of her ſex, ſhee ſo farre as poſſibly ſhe could hid him from her intents, that were to re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare him. And as the ordinary cuſtome of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is to oppoſe their honour to ſuch as ſpeak to them of love, <hi>Minerva</hi> forgot to hold up this buckler againſt ſuch armes as <hi>Adraſte</hi> could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:396:54"/>
talking to him, yet neretheleſſe in ſuch a manner of the ſence ſhee had of the one, as ſhee put him not in deſpair of ſuch as he had of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But they ſo long had known, and were ſo well acquainted with one another, that they could not poſſibly ſo well diſſemble it, but that they eſpied each other behinde the beſt curtain could be drawn. <hi>Minerva</hi> propoſed extreme dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in the love of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and <hi>Adraſte</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſolutions upon thoſe difficulties of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva:</hi> ſhee alleaged firſt her marriage, which abſolutely hindred her to be any way lawfully ſought. <hi>Adraſte</hi> put her in minde of <hi>Arnolphe,</hi> whom ſhee had lov'd before, and ſince, and whom yet ſhee lov'd after in death, however ſhee was ſtraightly obliged to love him, that lived, and was in affection before the other. By which hee let her ſee that the marriage ſhe alleaged, was but a pretext, by which ſhe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her ingratitude, being aſſured that if it had been the true cauſe that hindred her from lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving him, it had bin ſo as well for another as him. I lov'd <hi>Arnolphe</hi> before I married, ſaid ſhee, and that love which indeed I bore unto his vertues, nor that which as yet I bear his memory, did ever wrong my honour, where yours tendeth meerly to the ſubverſion of it. Your honor is eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in my diſcertation, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and though mine be one thouſand times more deer to me then my life, I ſhould chuſe rather a thouſand times to loſe it, then ever ſo little to have tainted yours. But you are too wiſe a woman, to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:396:54"/>
that honour chiefly doth inſiſt upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging, and is not incompatible with love. You are too wiſe a man likewiſe, anſwered <hi>Minerva,</hi> to think what you ſay; But if ſo be I ſhould grant you any thing ſo unfit to be granted, what reaſon have I yet to quite me of <hi>Arnolphes</hi> affection, to reinveſt me in thoſe of <hi>Adraſte?</hi> it were but to paſſe from one extream to another, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a love permitted, to a love forbidden, but from conſtancie, to inconſtancie, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſince you are no leſſe fickle then hee was ever conſtant: and howſoever hee be dead, the vertues that I loved in him are immortall, and in ſuch meaſure living in me, as I have no memery of life without it be to think of, and to live in him. One part of this diſcourſe was true, but the other artificially fained by <hi>Minerva,</hi> to ingage <hi>Adraſte</hi> the more, and to let him ſee how much ſhee did deſerve to be belov'd, in ſhewing him how capable ſhe was of love, and how much ſhe could cheriſh the affections of a living man, ſince ſhe ſo long retained thoſe of a dead one. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe according as I think, ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> but you talke not as you thinke: nor content to expreſſe your want of reaſon in your words, by accuſing me of lightneſſe, it ſeems that you will make it appear that you have leſſe in your actions, by the unprofitable affection you beare to the aſhes of <hi>Arnolphe.</hi> The cauſe you have to diveſt you of which, and put on mine, being reaſon it ſelf, that ſhould ever counſell you to preferre things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to thoſe are hurtfull, the recreative to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:396:55"/>
afflictive, and the reall to the imaginary. There are three things in the world which produce and do contain all the reſt, which be honour, profit, and pleaſure, and from his affections you cannot ſo much as hope of one of them, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary you muſt expect trouble, damage, and ſhame; wheras you may finde them all in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> with ſo much precedence, that if the other were yet living, hee muſt himſelfe be conſtrained to avow the preeminence, and you to acknowledge the deſert, if love were to be judged by the endevours, and by reaſon. <hi>Minerva</hi> without approbation, or reproving the reaſons of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> propoſed ſtill new difficulties, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times declyning her own intereſt, imitated ſuch <hi>Decoyes,</hi> as to gain an other mans mony, do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly loſe ſome of their own. Why if it ſhould be ſo, ſaid ſhee, an affection cannot be ſo eaſily ſhifted as wee do our ſmocks, heal mee firſt of my paſſion, and then will I cure you of yours. It is moſt certain, Madam, ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and I have approved it but too true in that I undergo for you; But where are now thoſe ſo ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by the which you have ere-whiles endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perſwade me that I might eaſily diſcharge me of mine? Why ſerve you not your ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelf, with the armes that you ſo well do handle againſt others? Why think you it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to free you from the paſſions which you have for a ſhadow, having to fore believed that it was eaſie unto me to acquit mee of thoſe I have for you? If the ſubject of my love be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:396:55"/>
then yours, and that I be more eaſie &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of love then you, as ſure it is too true; does it not follow then that your paſſion is leſſe then mine, and that you may more eaſily diſcharge you of it then I? But how will you that I ſhould heal you of a paſſion which you have for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you refuſe to receive from me the remedy you did deſire of him? I have given my ſelf a little liberty in enlarging of the extent of this diſcourſe, that it belongs to the Hiſtory, and is neceſſary to the end that I pretend to ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. If it be a little too long, Lovers will not be much diſpleaſed therwith; And others may paſſe it by, or more ſeriouſly fix on ſome other object. So it is that <hi>Adraſte</hi> again ſetting on foot this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the laſt ſpeech of <hi>Minerva,</hi> imployed all his five ſences to cure her of a diſeaſe which indeed ſhee had not, or leaſt wherwith hee was more infected, then ſhee, in which it hapned to him juſt as it did to <hi>Clement Marot,</hi> who ſeeing his Miſtris bleed, and the Chyrurgion telling him that with the ill bloud hee would likewiſe draw from her the ill humor that rendred her ſo cruell to him, and that the new bloud that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in her veins, ſhould mollifie her ſpirit and render her more capable of the impreſſions of love, added afterwards, that it was true, and that ſhe did become more gentle, and ſuſceptible of love, but the thing was, he concluded that it was not of his love. So <hi>Adraſte</hi> hath purged <hi>Minerva</hi> of this fancie, in hope that by efacing from her heart the portract of <hi>Arnolphe;</hi> he might the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:396:56"/>
ſet there his owne; renderd her truely amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but his ill hap would yet, twas not of him, as then. I ſay then, for that hee hath ſince found that it was his good fortune; And that he might well ſay as once a great Captaine did, that he had been loſt, if ſo he had not then been loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adraſte</hi> having once againe ſeene <hi>Minerva,</hi> continued his viſits ſo thicke, as it ſeemed he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwelt with her, then went to ſee her. In the morning hee uſed there from nine a clocke till noone. After dinner he ſtayed till ſupper, and after ſupper untill midnight. And howſoever his company was ſo frequent, yet hindred ſhee not the diligence of his Letters, that followed and forewent him twice a day, as doth the light both uſher, and attend the Sun: So as, either by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or by preſence, <hi>Minerva</hi> could not ope her eyes but ſhe ſaw <hi>Adraſte</hi> ever before her. From whence proceeded the jealouſie of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who as we have ſayd, was againe reſtored to her ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if not love. The firſt note whereof that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> received, was from her ſelfe, that had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers deſignes therein. Firſt ſhe deſired to know what he thought of it, and knowing well that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> was ignorant that ſhe was beloved of <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> in diſcovering the love hee had for her, it ſhewed ſhee had none for him: And in manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his jealouſie, ſhe would render <hi>Adraſte</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of <hi>Craſsus,</hi> as ſhe had rendred <hi>Craſsus</hi> jealous of <hi>Adraſte.</hi> For ſhe as it were ſwimming her ſelfe in pleaſure at the vexation of another, even to the torment of her owne ſoule, and ſuffering the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:396:56"/>
moſt extreame Martyrcomes, but to procure ſmall ones, it ſeemed that her repoſe was in the midſt of paines, and ſufferance, and the calme of her ſpirit conſiſted in the impetuous ſhocks, and violences, wherewith ſhe agitated others. Shee did affect a rough and high going ſea in love, and did eſteeme an affection ſoft and gentle, withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and fading, if ſo it were not intermingled with the ſharpneſſe of ſome jealouſie. Moreover in ſhewing the jealouſie of <hi>Craſsus,</hi> becauſe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte,</hi> ſhe manifeſted to <hi>Adraſte</hi> the affection ſhe had for him, for from the jealouſie of the one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly followed the affection ſhe had for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being certaine that <hi>Craſsus</hi> could not bee jealous of <hi>Minerva</hi> for <hi>Adraſte,</hi> if hee beleeved not that <hi>Adraſte</hi> was beloved of her. To which ſhe added this Art, to faine that ſhe did ſo much hate and had in horrour that paſſion, that if <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> had been otherwiſe pleaſing unto her, and that his demerits or his ſervices had obliged her to wiſh him well, yet was his jealouſie ſuch as might ruine and well overthrow what ever good will ſhe could have for him, and confirme all ſuch affections as he pretended to ſubvert in her. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> being no wait moved with the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> onely intreated <hi>Minerva</hi> ſhre would preſerve him her affection, which onely he deſired to keepe, and feared to looſe. That but it, all other things were very indifferent to him, and the paſſions of his enemies ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, as he beheld them rather with pleaſure, then offence. <hi>Minerva</hi> was much deceived in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:396:57"/>
this anſwer, for ſhe thought to quicken his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by the jealouſie of another, beleeving like them that eſteeme of nothing well that is not deare; that amorous delights cannot be pleaſant, if not ſharpe. But diſſembling, as full well ſhee knew, and was accuſtomed to do, ſhe by ſo much the more approved of this humor of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> as he cared little for the jealouſie of his Rivall, and made ſhew to love him the better for it; In the meane while bethinking her of other meanes to heighten his affection, inſomuch as this had fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. We have ſayd that <hi>Adraſte</hi> viſited her at many houres of the day, but chiefly after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which ſhe had forbidden all others, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to affoord it him onely; and which hee ſo dearely valued, as hee never fayled to let flip one without going thither. They were lodged in the Suburbs of St. <hi>Germans,</hi> but a good way one from the other; For <hi>Minerva</hi> lodg'd neere the Market, and <hi>Adraſte</hi> by the River ſide. One Evening as hee went to ſee her according to his cuſtome, he tooke along with him a yong gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man named <hi>Polinice,</hi> and a Laquay which ſhe had ſent then unto him to borrow a book; they were no ſooner out of <hi>Adraſtes</hi> lodging, to take the way that leadeth along the ditch from porte de <hi>Nifle,</hi> to that of <hi>Buſſy,</hi> but they heard ſome walk after them, and turning about, they ſaw a man muffled up in his cloak that made great haſte, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his ſword under his arme, and who having overtaken them, followed the ſame way they held upon the Cauſey, which is along by the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:396:57"/>
houſes. At the ſame time they perceived there were others yet, that kept them behind the piles of durt, which the paſſage of Coaches &amp; Carts cauſeth commonly in winter along by the ditch. And preſently <hi>Adraſte</hi> perceived that he that had overtaken them, ſlacked his pace, and reeld as he walked, as if he had been drunke. This man ſaid he to <hi>Polinice,</hi> counterfeiteth the drunkard, and h'is not ſo, for we ſaw him walke otherwiſe then thus, and very upright and luſtily, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me not another time, if it be not to put ſome trick upon us. Be it what will, anſwered <hi>Polinice,</hi> I thinke he will gaine little by us. In which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they walked on ſtill. <hi>Adraſte</hi> bid the Laquay to goe forward ſome five or ſixe paces with the light before, and not to be ſurprized, drew his ſword from out of his hangers, and bore it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his hand, and <hi>Polinice</hi> did the ſame by his likewiſe. They walked thus ſome thirty paces, and overtaking this <hi>Roiſter,</hi> that ſtaied to the ſame purpoſe. When he was amongſt them, and hee perceived the others which were not farre off, hee began to call aloud, <hi>Who be thoſe that laugh there?</hi> no man anſwered a word. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> houlding this for ſuſpect, and beleeving it was the word given amongſt them, as the event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, bade his footman go on, and <hi>Polinice</hi> follow, keeping himſelfe two or three paces before him <hi>Mounſieur,</hi> quoth then this gallant to <hi>Polinice,</hi> in ſiding him, and counterfeiting the ſtranger, can you ſhew me the way to St. <hi>Germans</hi> gate. No <hi>Mounſieur</hi> anſwered <hi>Polinice,</hi> ſcoffing him, I am
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:396:58"/>
not off this Country, more then your ſelfe are, nor do I know the ſtreets of the City. I am glad of that anſwered the other, whats that he would have ſayd <hi>Adraſte,</hi> who extreamly miſtruſted theſe devices. St. <hi>Germans</hi> gate replied <hi>Polinice,</hi> St. <hi>Germans</hi> gate Sir, quoth the Impoſtor. Looke you where tis ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> you are at it, or at leaſt in a faire way to it. I thanke you Sir replyed the Rogue; who not two ſteps after, ſeized on <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices</hi> ſword, ſaying, what will you draw your ſword? So ſoone as <hi>Adraſte</hi> heard talk of ſwords, he drew his; but howſoever it were as ſodainely as he could ſpeake, he had not ſo ſoone drawn it, but it was layd hold on, and their light put out at the very inſtant; which ſaved his life, for thoſe that layd hands on him, caſting themſelves alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and at once upon him, one wounded the other in ſeeking to kill him. So as of many thruſts made in the crowd, and in the confuſion of this darkneſſe, there was but one touched him, and that upon the arme. All the others lighting on the parties themſelves, on whoſe behalfes they were made. But feeling his ſword engaged, and ſeeing himſelfe in the midſt of ſo many enemies, as the greatneſſe of their number hindred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he heard ſome cry out kill, kill, and at the ſame time others, Oh you kill me; which put him in ſuch a fury as having recovered his ſword in two or three ſhocks, hee made himſelfe ſuch place, as the field, and fought battell reſted on his ſide. As for <hi>Polinice, Adraſte</hi> thought him dead, for that he had heard him call out <hi>Murther,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:396:58"/>
                  <hi>Murther,</hi> and having ſeen him fall to the ground; he beleeved certainly they had killed him. But theſe theeving Rogues having taken their flight, and the Neighbours being come in at the noiſe, with their weapons, &amp; lights, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he had diſingaged his ſword, and quit himſelfe of them with the loſſe of his cloake, and ſome light hurts he had received, wherewith he was become leſſe bloudy, then miry. Quite contrary to <hi>Adraſte,</hi> who found himſelfe more fowled with bloud then dirt, though it were with that of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; For the thruſt he received on the arme was ſo favorable, as it paſſed not the skin further then the fleſh. He loſt not his cloake, but his Hat fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off, and his Galloſhooes, both one and the other were preſently found in the Street, with the ſheathes of their ſwords. And howſoever that after the diſtemper of ſuch an incounter, he had more cauſe to retire to his lodging, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his deſigne; ſo is it, that apprehending more the affright <hi>Minerva</hi> might take at this newes, then the dammage might come to him in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, hee beleeved it was a ſmall cauſe to deprive him of a good, which he beleeved could not bee too dearely bought, not with the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of the world: And this hindrance not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſerved but more to re-inflame the deſire hee had to ſee his Miſtreſſe, he tooke onely another Laquay with another Torch at his lodging, and in the ſame caſe hee was in, hee came preſently with <hi>Polinice</hi> to that of <hi>Minerva;</hi> hee found her and the Laquay yet ſhaking at the affright they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:396:59"/>
had tane, and he recounting to her the death of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and <hi>Polinice:</hi> For having ſeen them laid hands on, and invironed by ſo many, he bleeved not that they could eſcape, and for him, it was eaſie to flee, for that they had nothing to do, but with his light, which being at firſt put out, they gave him very good leiſure to retire. So ſoon as <hi>Minerva</hi> ſaw <hi>Adraſte,</hi> ſhe ſeemed to rejoyce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, And I aſſuredly beleeve it was no way fained, whatſoever hath beene ſayd, that this ambuſh was layd, and <hi>Minerva</hi> had not ſent for the booke by her Laquay, ſo much for that, as to bring him in compaſſe of the ſnares of theſe Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals; which could never enter in the thought or beliefe of <hi>Adraſte.</hi> You have prevented me of an ill nights reſt, ſayd ſhe, which this companion went about to prepare for mee: I beleeve you could not have beſtowed a viſit on me this good while, or ſo pleaſing, or neceſſary as this was; But tell mee, how happened this misfortune to you? Madam, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> your Laquay is not ſo blame worthy as you may thinke, for he ſaw me in ſuch caſe, as there was more liklihood that he left me dead, then alive: But it pleaſeth God that I live yet for your ſervice, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on you more neceſſary viſits, and more pleaſing nights then this. And then he recounted at large to her what had befallen him ſince Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whilſt the uncloaked gentleman <hi>Polinice</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained her women with the ſame diſcourſe. Very well ſayd <hi>Minerva,</hi> then I bid you good night, and deſire you come no more at ſuch
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:396:59"/>
houres to ſee mee. That is to take good nights from me, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and not to give mee good night, this ſame command not to ſee you any more by night. It ſhall be what you pleaſe, replied <hi>Minerva,</hi> for I ſhall indeed rather chuſe to take from you good nights, then ſuffer upon my occaſion that you perchance have your life taken from you, as you have now very narrowly eſcaped with it. <hi>Adraſte</hi> accepting her will for reaſon, retir'd with his good, or ill night, after having tould her, that God did reſerve him to ſome better end; and that on no occaſion his life could be ſo well imployed, as in the loſſe of it, for ſo worthy a Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adraſte</hi> being retired without any further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, paſſed the night as accuſtomed in the thought and contemplation of an enchanted Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by the charmes of a fair Miſtris. The next morning riſing very early, he went to take a turn at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where he was informed of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the King. It was at the time of the great aſſembly at <hi>Rochell,</hi> which being made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſties permiſſion, and continued contrary to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, gave cauſe to the Court of Parliament to declare them that held it rebels, and to the King to arme himſelf, for the defence of his authority. <hi>Adraſte</hi> went from thence to the upriſing of <hi>Minerva,</hi> carried her theſe ſad news, not ſo much lamenting the publique miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that threatned the State with a civill war, as his own particular condition, that forced him leave his Miſtris, to uſe his life in a quarrell
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:396:60"/>
wherin he had ſo little intereſt. For howſoever he were not conſtrained by any place, or benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Kings, he was neretheleſſe born and enforced therto, by the laws of his own worth and honour? But ſince that nothing induceth you ſaid <hi>Minerva,</hi> to follow the King but your honour, you are not obliged to follow him other where then in ſervice. Let other men then go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and wait on him, whoſe offices and penſions doe oblige them to attendance every where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and do you ſtay untill he does ſit down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome place, or that hee hath made ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture of war wherin you may be ſeen to do the ſervice you deſire: and think not then that I will make it difficult to give you leave, for that your life being of ſmaller eſteem to me by much then is your honour, I ſhall rather chuſe to command then to forbid it you. <hi>Adraſte</hi> was eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſtay with a Lady, whom indeed hee could not indure to part from, but ſeeing he had not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to entertain her as hee wiſhed in her houſe, where ſhe was watched by her own people, gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and corrupted by <hi>Craſſus,</hi> &amp; the prime of the Spring, inviting every one to ſee the beauty of the Country, hee intreated her to bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to <hi>Ruel,</hi> to the end that no other but the Nymphs of thoſe fountains ſhould be by at the laſt farwels hee would take of her. <hi>Minerva</hi> that deſired but to paſſe time away, rendred <hi>Adraſte</hi> his deſires in that, by contenting likewiſe her own. But what ſhe might eaſily and abſolutely of herſelf have done, was accompained with ſo
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:396:60"/>
many limitations and circumſtances, as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it was ever leſſe then the ſufferance, were it that by the difficulty ſhe would render her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, the more eſtimable; or were it a quality inſeparable in love, that often promiſeth much ſweetneſſe, where naught is reaped but much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe. Reaſon, and what was decent not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſhe ſhould go alone with <hi>Adraſte,</hi> cauſed her to take with her an old Gentlewoman that was rather her Governeſſe then Servant, with two little children that ſhe had had by <hi>Tatius,</hi> and would yet have <hi>Plancus</hi> and <hi>Melite,</hi> beſides of the company. <hi>Melite</hi> was one of her friends, and <hi>Plancus</hi> a new Captive of <hi>Minerva's</hi> whom ſhee had inſnared without <hi>Adraſte</hi> once perceiving it: whom ſhe made believe, how ſhee could tender him amorous of <hi>Melite. Adraſte</hi> agreed very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to that, thinking that whilſt <hi>Plancus</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Melite,</hi> and that the Governeſſe ſhould be buſied with <hi>Minerva's</hi> children, he ſhould have no ill opportunity to govern her. But the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was to get from her houſe, and people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected, for ſhe would not by any means that they ſhould know of this journy, for fear it might come to <hi>Craſſus</hi> eare. And this Lady otherwiſe exceeding able; had already given him ſuch Empire over her, as not ſo much as ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring <hi>Tatius</hi> that was her husband, ſhe let her ſelf be troubled with the jealouſie of a man, that ſhe ſaid was nothing to her, and that ſhe ſeemed not onely to be unable to love, but alſo one of whom ſhee could not endure to be beloved. It is moſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:396:61"/>
certain that ſuch as be in love are blinde, for if <hi>Adraſte</hi> abſolutely had not bin ſo, he might by this have ſeen that <hi>Craſſus</hi> had more intereſt in his Miſtris, then himſelf. But he believed more in her words, then in his own eyes. To the end then that <hi>Minerva's</hi> people ſhould take no notice of the deſigne, ſhe willed that <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſhould wait very early in the morning at Church with a coach and four horſes, that <hi>Plancus</hi> and <hi>Melite</hi> ſhould come thither another way without either of them comming neer her, and that ſhe would meet there at the ſame time with her little companions. The Coach and horſes they were ready almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day; ſcarce was the Church doore opened but <hi>Adraſte</hi> was got in; hee had heard at the leaſt two Maſſes, before <hi>Plancus,</hi> or <hi>Melite</hi> came, though they failed not at the houre appointed them, bnt ſhe that appointed it failing them many houres after. And after having waited one or two, which were ſo many ages to the impatience of <hi>Adraſte;</hi> who had ſent three or four Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers one after another, that brought back word, that ſhe was ready, that ſhe was come out, that ſhe came; ſhee arrived at laſt about ten a clock when every one began to deſpaire of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at all. And in place of excuſe for having made the company ſtay ſo long, ſhe would needs perſwaded <hi>Adraſte</hi> that hee was extremly bound to her for the pains ſhee had taken in getting ſo ſoon away from her houſhold, and affairs both: for ſhe told him that ſhe had an occaſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary importance at the Palace, which ſhe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:396:61"/>
had neglected for his love. <hi>Adraſte</hi> replyed not a word to that, but letting her ſay what ſhe would, got him into the Coach with her, ſufficiently manifeſting by his ſilence, and looks that he was more offended at her words by which ſhe would excuſe her fault, then at the fault it ſelfe. They were ſoon out of the City keeping the direct way to <hi>Ruel,</hi> when <hi>Minerva</hi> angred at <hi>Adraſtes</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and grudge, asked him whether he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to accompany him into the Country to aire themſelves there, or his ill humour? and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſtill forbore to ſpeak, ſhe continued, I am very unhappy to quit ſuch company as adored and reverenced me, to finde me ſlighted here, and to have neglected my affaires, to offend them I thought to have obliged. Turn about Coachman, ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> without anſwering <hi>Minerva,</hi> and drive to the Palace, that this Lady may by no means neglect her buſineſſe. It is not poſſible to expreſſe the deſpight ſhee tooke at theſe words. He ſhall turn I aſſure you, ſaid ſhee, or I will go back thither a foot. But <hi>Melite</hi> blaming <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and gently entreating <hi>Minerva</hi> that would by all means have returned, perſwaded ſo farre as they followed on their way to <hi>Ruel. Minerva</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding having got out of the Coach, <hi>Adraſte</hi> took her under the arme, and led her along a fair way more then a mile, whilſt the Coach follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſoftly with the others that were in it. And as Lovers are ſoon angry, and ſoon pleaſed, and re-alight the fires of their affections by the breath of ſuch brabbles, they had not ſo ſoone
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:396:62"/>
began to diſcourſe together, but they became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed: For <hi>Minerva</hi> cared not if one offended her, ſo they asked pardon of the offence. And <hi>Adraſte</hi> cared not to offend her on thoſe termes, if it were a giving her offence, to reſent the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he had received from her. Arrived at <hi>Ruel,</hi> the firſt thing they talked of was dinner; after which they fell into diſcourſe, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would be much troubled to reſaye, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet by that importune old Beldam, who una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to follow them walking, left not yet to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune them with her eyes thorow every Ally of the plots, and parteries into which theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently beautifull Orchards are divided. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the burthen of age, and the care ſhe had of the little ones in her charge, gave leiſure and opportunity yet to our <hi>Adraſte,</hi> ſomewhile to enjoy his Miſtris in the cool of a ſhade, whileſt <hi>Plancus</hi> and <hi>Melite</hi> entertained each other in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, where in the preſence of the Nymphs and other loanly deities of thoſe ſacred foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, their waters were taken to witneſſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of their flames. <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſummoning yet, things more firme and ſolid, ſwore that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhould change their courſe ere he his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris; and that the earth ſhould ſooner leave her firme ſtability, then his love its laſting quality. And <hi>Minerva</hi> ſwore that waters ſhould riſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fire deſcend downward, ere ſhe would leave to love <hi>Adraſte.</hi> But thoſe things ſhee ſwore by being light, and tranſitory, could not produce but lightneſſes, no leſſe agreeing with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:396:62"/>
their qualities, then her nature. After having plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly paſt the remaynder of this day, they took again the way back to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo late as they durſt ſtay, but they got not thither without danger, for the Coachman being drunk, drave his Coach ſo careleſly over a bridge in the way, as for lack of take heed, the Horſes, Coach and all that was in had like to have faln into the water, but God was pleaſed to ſhew them the precipice onely, &amp; keep them out of it. The reſt of the way, they talked not but of the journey of <hi>Adraſte, Minerva</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as ſhort, as happy to him; and <hi>Adraſte</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeching her not to let ſuch, (as then hee being preſent deſired to croſſe his fortunes) any way to ruine them in his abſence; it being a certainty that ſuch as ſought to overthrow him, in her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions being now with her, would not forbeare when he were gone. <hi>Minerva</hi> complained of this his requeſt, as grounded ſhe thought, upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtruſt <hi>Adraſte</hi> had of her ſaith and conſtancie, and ſhewing him the Sun that as then yet ſhined; ſo long, ſaid ſhee, as this ſo glorious a Planet, ſtill ſhall be the light and comfort, of all mortall men, ſo long ſhall you be mine; I could pardon one that had not known my minde ſo well as you, but you are by ſo much the leſſe excuſable as you the better know it. <hi>Adraſte</hi> excuſed him, if the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe a thing, the preſervation wherof was ſo extreamly valued by him, and the loſſe ſo rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, had conſtrained him to intreat her to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her affection to him; which ſhould he loſe,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:396:63"/>
he muſt for ever grieve the miſchance, and never ceaſe to accuſe his fate or indeferts, and keeping it as now ſhe did aſſure him ſhe would; he ſhould part thence with ſuch felicity, and comforts in himſelfe, as he promiſed fortune, never more to to take offence at any luckleſſe chance ſhee ere ſhould put upon him. In concluſion of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they came to the City, &amp; to went ſet down <hi>Minerva</hi> at the end of the ſtreet wherin her houſe was, for ſhe would not ſuffer them to accompany her any further, not for fear of <hi>Tatius</hi> who was farre enough off, and for whom ſhe cared little, but for fear of increaſing the jealouſie of <hi>Craſſus</hi> that lay at watch in the ſame ſtreet, where he had taken a lodging to wav-lay all reſort to <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va'es.</hi> And for that ſhee deſired they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve yet that ſhe cared not for him; <hi>Adraſte</hi> poor man that ſaw this, gave, as I ſay, more faith to the witneſſe of her words in the contrary, then he put in his own eyes that ſaw it. For this cauſe it is; They ſay that love is blinde, inſomuch as paſſion hood-winketh all ſuch as follow him, troubles their judgment, and takes from them their very knowledge. <hi>Plancus</hi> went home with <hi>Melite,</hi> and <hi>Adraſte</hi> retired to his own lodging with intent to write to <hi>Minerva,</hi> as if it had bin ſome long time, ſince he ſaw her furious effects of a violent and extraordinary affection, which we will now leave, the ſooner to ſee the end of the firſt part of this Book.</p>

chiefly at glory, and holding <hi>Minerva</hi> for ſuch, rendred her the honors <hi>Craſſus</hi> could not; and without medling in her affaires, endeavored one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conforme her to his pleaſures, hoping that his compliance, gentile faſhion and affection, ſhould render him more worthy her love then his Rivall. <hi>Craſſus</hi> tooke another courſe, for fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he had not in him thoſe good parts that ſufficed to win the heart of <hi>Minerva,</hi> &amp; re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der him preferable to ſo many others at all parts better qualified then him, of all whom ſhe was hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and adored; under pretence of officiouſly embracing her affaires, firſt he got her papers, and writings into her hands, and not long after, her Iewells, to the end that both the one and the other, ſhould render him neceſſary, ſince hee could not render himſelfe amiable; and that this neceſſity, and fitneſſe, might become love, as it had don with <hi>Tatius,</hi> though he had more cauſe to ſhun, then imitate the example, had hee beene counſelled by his Reaſon, and not by his paſſion. And <hi>Minerva,</hi> that already once before had been taken in the like ſnare, after having beene often forewarned, ſuffered her ſelfe yet againe to bee caught, but it happened not till after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Adraſte.</hi> In the meane time two or three daies after the journey to <hi>Ruel,</hi> the King leaving <hi>Paris</hi> to go to <hi>Saumur,</hi> cauſed <hi>Adraſte</hi> to provide to follow him. VVhen ſee, upon an adviſe that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande</hi> was fallen ſicke ſome forty Leagues from <hi>Paris, Minerva</hi> reſolved preſently to go ſee her, her affection overcomming all difficulties that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:396:67"/>
oppoſed her endeavours, which indeed were then no ſmall ones, for the want of a Coach, the aboundance of fowle weather, nor the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the waies, could any whit divert her therin. <hi>Craſſus</hi> had the firſt notice, as he to whom the packets of <hi>Minerva</hi> were ſtill addreſſed, who being unable to accommodate her with more then one Nag to carry her, it was needfull to make uſe of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> but he was ready to be gone; and to borrow his Horſes at the time of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, was ſomwhat out of ſeaſon. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, <hi>Minerva</hi> tould him, if hee were not urged to depart by any neceſſity, ſhe would intreate him to lend her a horſe for ſome five or ſixe dayes. <hi>Adraſte</hi> was ſo farre from refuſing a horſe to <hi>Minerva,</hi> that he could haue wiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe one, for the happineſſe of ſuch a burthen, and already envied the honor of the beaſt ſhould beare ſo ſweet a burthen; which for all that had beene but a miſerable good fortune, for ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him his horſe ſo jaded, and cripled, as he never did him ſervice after. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> wiſhed he had beene as much worth, as himſelfe, or as much as he could hope in the world, and the the had died in her ſervice; beleeving that his life could not be better emploied, then in ſo happy loſſe of it. But hee was not content to ſend her a horſe onely, he went and offered himſelfe to be her guide, all other occaſions ſet apart, and moſt humbly intreated her to give him leave to waite upon her. She thanked him, prayd him to ſtay her returne to <hi>Paris,</hi> or newes of her there at leaſt,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:396:68"/>
and to take the charge on him, of ſometimes ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her children for her, whom ſhe left in the hands of the <hi>Governeſſe</hi> we have before ſpoke of: and parted the ſame evening in extream bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, accompanied onely with one man, and a maide that attended her. <hi>Adraſte</hi> bore her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, untill ſuch time as ſhe commanded him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; and being forbidden to follow her any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee accompanied her yet with his eyes ſo farre as his ſight gave him leave, and then excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding penſive, he returned not to his lodging, but <hi>Minervas,</hi> to cheere him for her abſence in the entertainment of her children. Who in the firſt innocence wherein they were yet, not knowing any thing of their Mothers abſence, cauſed in him no leſſe pitty of them, then ſhe cauſed love in him. In the meane time while he buſied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there, a knaviſh Laquay, with whom hee had increaſed his followers for the Iourney in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, having before taken notice of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys he had to that uſe provided, intended to lay hands on it, which he ſo happily brought about, that at his going from thence, <hi>Adraſte</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe firſt without Footman, and ſo ſoone as hee came to his Lodging, without money, which was indeed a divertiſement, but very hurtfull to his purſe, and little wholeſome for his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it yet hindred not, but he thought ſtill on <hi>Minerva,</hi> that to ſay truth, tooke up his whole thoughts: And in the violence of that griefe hee ſuffered by the abſence of two or three dayes, he apprehended what hee was to undergoe in the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:396:68"/>
length of ſo many months, ſo as he was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burthened with his preſent ills, but likewiſe with thoſe were to come. But <hi>Minerva</hi> having found her Mother in better ſtate then ſhe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, came backe to <hi>Paris</hi> eight daies after her departure, with the ſame diligence ſhee was gone from thence: and by her returne diſperſed ſuch clouds as darkned the ſerenitie of <hi>Adraſtes</hi> ſpirits, that might ſay with one,

               <p>The firſt day of her arivall was paſſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, gracious favours, and kind welcomes The ſecond, however <hi>Adraſte</hi> never feaſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invited, as the French hath it, nor tooke notice of any others affaires, but when he was thereto required, ſhee intreated him to perſwade one of her Farmors to give up the Leaſe of the lands ſhe formerly had made him. This Tennant of hers was a clowne, if ever were ſuch, and yet a more knave then clowne; So as hee deſerved to have beene well cudgel'd, nor would <hi>Minerva</hi> have tane it amiſſe. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> loving the reputation of his Miſtris equall with his owne, and ſeeing it was not for the honour of the one or the other to beate this Looby, rendr'd him, how extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo ever brutall, yet ſo capable of reaſon in the end, as he promiſed not onely to give up his Leaſe, but alſo to become conformable to the will and pleaſure of <hi>Minerva. Minerva</hi> as then had few thoughts to which <hi>Adraſte</hi> was not made
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:396:69"/>
privy, for in recompence of his ſervice, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated her ſecrets, at leaſt ſuch as he had not intereſt in. For proofe whereof, ſhe recounted to him an action of <hi>Tatius,</hi> which well noteth the great confidence betweene them. <hi>Tatius</hi> being privately ſome time before come to <hi>Paris,</hi> got one day unperceived to his Wives houſe, where ſtaying below in a little Parlour, hee cauſed <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> to be called downe thither, who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſhe might honeſtly refuſe to ſee her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, not miſtruſting any ill, came down to the ſame roome, where he ſtayed her. After having ſaluted, <hi>Minerva</hi> praying him to walke up into her chamber, he tould her, that he had but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while to ſtay there with her, aud hee deſired not to be ſeene, no not of her ſervants, and that being borne away by that extreame affection which he ever had for her, ſhe muſt beleeve that this viſit ſo unexpectedly made, and by ſtealth, was a ſufficient teſtimony thereof. But thou moſt faire <hi>Minerva,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued he, having tane her in his armes, art thou not in pitty any whit ſenſible of my misfortunes? Sir, anſwered <hi>Minerva,</hi> I am not ſo inſenſible &amp; ſtony but I ſuffer ſome impreſſion from your paſſion; and in your diſgraces do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate yet as in mine own. But you know well the cauſe that parted mine from your intereſt, and I wiſh no other Iudge in this caſe, then your ſelfe. Indeed ſaid <hi>Tatius,</hi> I did not uſe you I confeſſe as your demerits did oblige me; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the paſſions of a Lover, pardon him that does repent him, forget the ills that I have done
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:396:69"/>
you, and but now remember you of all the good that I have wiſhed you, you ſhall make nature a lyar, if you become not then as pittifull, as you are faire, if you have not the ſame ſweetneſſe in your minde you carry in your looks. They were all alone, for the ſervant that had called downe <hi>Minerva,</hi> was gon out, and <hi>Tatius</hi> enjoying thoſe rights the opportunity, and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition afforded him, and reducing ſo his words into actions tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the heart of <hi>Minerva,</hi> which was not made of wood, or marble, as partly by conſent, partly by force, he reentred the poſſeſſion of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he had formerly loſt. But ſo ſoone as hee had ſatisfied his owne deſires; See but the thanks of this diſloyall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ingratefull ſoule. No man can witneſſe, ſaid he, that I have now been heere, Thinke not I came for love of thee, but of my owne revenge; to the end, that after having left with thee what I can utterly deny, I ſo may give thee loſt. Lo here the wicked act of <hi>Tatius,</hi> which amongſt the moſt remarkable baſeneſſes that ere were perpetrate, may hold the place of the moſt enormous treaſon, and the moſt faithleſſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, that huſband ever committed gainſt a wife. <hi>Minerva</hi> never truſted this ſecret but to the fidelity of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> who never abuſed that truſt, or ever wronged her in it, and if hee hath ſpoke on't ſince, it hath beene ſtill to her defence, gainſt ſuch as have accuſed, and blamed her much, for living from her huſband. And to make ſeen what cauſe ſhe had to be for ever doubtfull and miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſuch and ſo inveterate and ſetled a malice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:396:70"/>
As <hi>Adraſte</hi> had no care that tended not to the ſervice of <hi>Minerva;</hi> it ſeemed no leſſe that ſhee had no inclination but tended to the love of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte:</hi> She ſpake not but of his merits, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred her not but of his ſervices, nor in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, thought of any thing more then of the meanes to acknowledge them. Yet this faire ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, but preſaged a ſtorme. Sailors have cauſe to ſeare a calme too ſmiling, And phyſitians think it not amiſſe to doubt a health too perfect and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; for as the one doth but preſage a furious ſtorme, the other argues ſtill a dangerous diſeaſe. But when that ſickneſſe doth ſucceed exceſſe of health, Raines, a great winde, or ſtormes enſue groſſe clouds, no man at all is moved thereat; for that already were foreſeeen the ſignes that uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precede. But when that in a time cleere and ſerene, the face of heaven is in an inſtant bound about with clouds; Or that we ſee a man to die at going out of bed, that did ariſe in health; Tis then we do become affraid, and that amazement, ſeiſeth us, for that we are ſurprized, and by ſo much the more aſtoniſhed, from theſe accidents as we could not foreſee the event. So had there beene but any cauſe, or a pretext that had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the diſgrace of our <hi>Adraſte,</hi> here, hee had not marvailed at it aught, for he knew well what kinde of ſoule he had to deale withall. But all at once when he the leſt expected it, and that he did eſteeme himſelfe the moſt in favour with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, not knowing why, or doubting how, hee found him fallen in her contempt: and in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:396:70"/>
place of recompence and thoſe kinde favours, whereof his tried affections, and his ſervices did render him moſt worthy, he did yet undergo the ſcornes and chaſtiſements, which he had no way merited. He had not three dayes to ſtay in <hi>Paris,</hi> when going to ſee her one morning a little later then hee was wont, hee found ſhee was gone to Church, whither very readily following her, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in deſire to ſee her, then for any other devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had: It is no mervaile that God permitted him to be ſo ill entreated. She had in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany only the Governeſſe, and had already heard Maſſe upon the arivall of <hi>Adraſte,</hi> who having bid her good morrow, preſented her his hand to leade her home, dinner time preſſed them not ſo, but having ſufficient leiſure, fair weather to walk in, and the place they were in, inviting them thereto; <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that thought he might have better liberty to entertaine her in this walke, then at her houſe, intreated her to take a turne in the Garden of that faire houſe, belonging to the <hi>Queene</hi> Mother. And <hi>Minerva</hi> admitted him to conduct her, as well to entertaine him, though very differently, and with an entertainment, and welcome much contrary to the deſires and hopes of <hi>Adraſte.</hi> So, as he preſſed her to recompence his ſervices, and at the leaſt, would needes have ſome kinde favour from her; for him to beare along with him unto the warres. <hi>Minerva</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her diſcourſe, did tell him ſtraite, that his ſo frequent viſits, and diſorderly addreſſes unto her, had ſcandalized her much with all the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:396:71"/>
Neighbours bout her houſe, ſo as ſhe was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to intreat him come more ſeldome there, that eſteeming his company as ſhe did, ſhe could not deprive her of it, ſhe ſayd, with little griefe, of which ſhe did beleeve that hee would have his part, but knowing likewiſe that he did eſteeme more of her reputation, then himſelfe, ſhe hoped he alwaies would preferre that good, to any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that he could receive from ſeeing her; that would the beſt ſhe might temper her ſorrows for not ſeeing him, with the remembrance ſhe would keepe of him; And never ſhould ſhe have ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in her breaſt, ought elſe beſides as that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting memory of his deſerts. <hi>Adraſte</hi> having ſuch a lecture, upon the Eve of his departure, loſt all manner of patience, and ſtraite it came into his head, that it was but an effect of the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and that contempt he had ever had of him till then, turned into fury; He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred him of the adviſe <hi>Minerva</hi> her ſelfe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and how oft ſhe had ſayd that all her houſe was ſtill averſe to him but ſhe; and caſting an eye upon the Governeſſe, accompanied her, he did beleeve, as it was true indeed, that nothing but her counſailes, and ſeducements could have power to make her capable of his diſgrace, and her maliciouſneſſe. And as amongſt a multitude of things one knows not what to chuſe, or leave; So <hi>Adraſte</hi> did not know in ſo great choice, and ſuch diverſity of Reaſons, what to anſwer her; ſo from the aboundance of his Reaſon, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his want of words. At the laſt his paſſions
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:396:71"/>
breaking ſilence, this he ſayd. Madam, ſo long as you aſſured me that it could not alter your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I have ſcoft my enemies, and made mee merry at their jealouſies; but now that you doe let me ſee the contrary, by a diſcourſe ſo out of ſeaſon, and all ſence, it is no ſlighting them. And I ſee well to what it tends. <hi>Minerva</hi> perceiving that <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſpake this by <hi>Craſſus,</hi> anſwered in his favour, and by her anſwer as it were partaking in his intereſt, ſhee more incenſed <hi>Adraſtes</hi> fury, who not willing to continue this diſcourſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a woman, and one he had ſo perfectly adored, left her to walke alone with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and went to <hi>Craſſus</hi> his lodging, reſolved if he met with him, to make him tak to his ſword. But not finding him, hee paſſed away his rage in dining with an il appetite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Minerva</hi> retiring home extreamly grieved, that ſhe had ſo reduced <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> to deſpaire, and apprehending what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance might riſe thereon, inſtead of going to dinner, went to bed tormented even to death, and much offended at the Governeſſe, and <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> too, the curſed Authors of ſo unhappy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. <hi>Craſſus</hi> comming to her hereupon, and then much out of time, deſiring to impart his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, found ſo ill a welcome, that having very handſomely received her leave to be gone, hee tooke her at her word, and went not onely away from her houſe, but out of the City alſo, though not very farre, for he returned within two daies, were it on his owne motion, or that ſhe ſent for him. <hi>Adraſte</hi> having ſent away his Equipage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:396:72"/>
but after the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> changed the deſire he had to cal <hi>Craſſus</hi> to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, into a much better deſign of ſerving his Prince, and more bravely manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his courage in occaſions more honourable &amp; more dangerous indeed to take his journy the next morning, with a Horſe and one Laquay onely, which he had cauſed to be left for him, he was though to conclude his leave taking, and bid ſome adiew which as yet he had not done, and he determined to depart without once bidding far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>Minerva.</hi> Who returning the ſame day from Veſpers, and ſeeing <hi>Adraſtes</hi> Laquay who waited him with his horſe at the door of a Ladies lodging by, asked him where his Maſter was? Madam anſwered the Laquay, he is within here. Why replyed <hi>Minerva,</hi> and is he not yet gone? not yet Madam but his Equipage is already well forwards on the way, theſe words touched the quick, for <hi>Minerva</hi> thought <hi>Adraſte</hi> had not bin ſo neer ready, nor that hee could have reſolved to part without bidding her adiew. But whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe thought, diſſembling it before the laquay, ſhe ſaid to him well my good friend tell him, I pray, that I do kiſſe his hands. The Laquay failed not to tell his Maſter ſo at his comming out from thence, which did not alter him at all, but on the contrary the little day which yet reſted importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him more then that, and hee wiſhed night were paſſed, to the end he might the next day make a great journey forward on his way, and by ſo much withdraw and bear himſelf the further from this thankleſſe and ingratefull ſoul. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:396:72"/>
which he had wrote a Letter that he determined ſhould be delivered to her when he was gone, by which he gave her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>That if he had followed the ſtream of his firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which the violence of hers had born him, hee had let her ſee an action, which ſhee not onely had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but the indifference that ſhee had manifeſted unto him, had cleerly ingaged him to. That hee had ſought, found, and ruined the honour which ſhe did ſo much eſteem, or elſe himſelf, which yet hee could not think; or at the worſt it had bin the beſt, that could befall him, for that his life was ſo unhappy by her meanes, as it muſt needs have been a great good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to have loſt it. But ſince upon reflection in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and having leſſe regard to his own paſsions, then to the intereſt ſhe had in them (whatever oath ſhe had taken to have none) hee had believed that it ſhould no way misbecome him, goe his way to a place, where a more great and honourable danger might make ſeen to her, his more obdience and courage, then hee could render her in the defeat of one, ſo miſerable, whom he did deem ſufficiently puniſhed in the vexations ſhee would procure him. Beſides he was not willing to ruine ſo many incomparable proofs of affection, as hee had daily manifeſted, by one action that might be the leaſt diſpleaſing to her; and not expecting that there could be found content for him after (for her pleaſure) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baniſht from all that he enjoyed in the whole earth. That this had cauſed him haſten his deſire, leaſt ſome new accident, with the remembrance of ſo bloudy a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:396:73"/>
diſcourteſie, bore him not yet to mend himſelfe as hee could. And however that hee parted thence, deprived of the honour of her ſight, by her ſo cruell doom, with as much ſpoile and ranſack as an extreme fury could poſsibly make in the breſt of a man, hee yet did beare along with him, thoſe his affections to her as freſhly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving even in this her great disfavour, as if ſhee had honord him with all the graces, that ſhe could conferre. Which now hee did not ſay to bend her ought to pitty; for hee in giving her this laſt adiew, did give it alſo to all hope to ſee her face, or once to write to her more, but twas to let her ſee the conſtancie and excellence of his tryed love, ſince that he did conſerve it yet, within the midſt of loſſe, and that how low and baſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his were thoſe affections which ſhe yet prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adraſte</hi> bethinking him of means to deliverher this Letter, was viſited by three or foure of his friends, that cauſed him to ſup at home, and to paſſe with them the remaynder of this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome day. After Supper, taking the ayre with the ſame company along the walk by the River, which is right againſt the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and talking of his departure, as one that meant to be on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back by eight a clock in the morning, he felt one pull him behind, and turning head, hee ſaw <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva's</hi> Footman, who having cauſed him break off diſcourſe, and bid adiew to the company, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a note from his Miſtris, which <hi>Adraſte</hi> as then did not open, nor could hee have read it without light; But haſt thou ſaid he, to the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:396:73"/>
Laquay, nothing elſe to ſay to me? No Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd hee, but that I moſt humbly kiſſe your hands. Well then, return ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bear back this Letter to your Lady, which I had thought ſhould not have bin delivered till after my depart, and having given him his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, went into his lodging to read <hi>Minerva's,</hi> that was to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe lines that bring you my adiew, ſince I my ſelfe cannot otherwiſe give it, may aſſure you that I doe wiſh you a happy journey, and a ready return that am your ſervant.</p>
               <p>Howſoever <hi>Adraſte</hi> were extreamly incenſed againſt <hi>Minerva,</hi> he became ſo appeaſed by the reading this note, as he reſolved to ſee her that Evening, though it were very late, In which might well be ſeen he was truly amorous; And that <hi>Minerva</hi> knowing him no leſſe eaſie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained, then rejected, cauſed theſe deviſes with him on aſſurance or rather preſumption ſhe had of regaining, or calling him back at pleaſure. Going then to her houſe, they told him that ſhe was in bed: but if he would go up to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he ſhould not fail to ſee her. So went he up and having ſat him down on her bed ſide, after ſaluting her, but with countenance ſomewhat cool, and ſhamefull, ſaid ſhe to him before he had leiſure to ſpeak. Now you ſee my goodnes very true, ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> yet are you as ſlow of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as ready of anger, if you were but as quick

to heal, as you are to hurt you might yet be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But what will you ſay of my eaſineſſe, ſaid ſhe, that had not the heart to let you part, without calling you backe. Nay, what will you ſay of mine, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that had not the ſpirit to go my ways, after ſo many indignities, without returning upon ſo ſmall a ſigne, as you gave me that you deſired it. Call it not eaſineſſe, it is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in you, anſwered <hi>Minerva,</hi> or rather your duty, you cannot be a ſlave, and a free man, both at once, nor to be to mee, and execute your own deſignes, without conforming them to mine. It is then leſſe in you anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> without you will have it eaſines to call back by reaſon, him you had baniſhed without cauſe. It was an eaſines in you to take from me your company, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, to render me again, ſince there is nought ſo ſlack and ill as is ingratitude, nor any thing more generous then is a free acknowledgment &amp; requitall. You ſay your pleaſure, anſwered <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> and I have done as I ought. As you ought Madam, replyed <hi>Adraſte,</hi> was it a part of your devoir, to forbid me viſiting you the Eve of my departure, behoved it you, to have permitted me ſo long, juſt then to barre and keepe me out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoov'd it you to have ſo many times given notice to me of my Rivals jealouſies, to baniſh me upon the firſt complaint I made of them, and openly ſo much oppoſe your paſſions, to my Reaſons. Nay, ſayd <hi>Minerva,</hi> lets aboliſh now, and quite forget thoſe things; I protect the abſent gainſt the preſent ever. And you are ignorant what I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:396:74"/>
have ſaid to him on your behalfe, you being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and you perhaps thinke much at what hee holds himſelfe contented with. Madam anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Adraſte,</hi> abſolutions and forgiveneſſes, if ſo you meane, are ſtill for crimes, as recompences are for ſervices. You have cauſe to wiſh you could forget the wrongs you have done to mee; And I have reaſon neretheleſſe to urge my ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. As to the cauſe that others have to pleaſe themſelves, or to complaine them, of the uſage, good, or ill, that you afford to them, I not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, or neere, or further off. I have told you heretofore, that your deportment was ſo juſt on my behalfe, as that the very wrongs which you have done to mee; to me, have yet ſeemed good. But I complaine that any one ſhould ere controle both mine, and your carriage, that people no way intereſſed in the one, or other, ſhould yet take upon them both. And above all I needes muſt grieve, that you, that ought not once to grant your pardon to the thought, ſhould have ſo much approved the effect, as that in place of being offended gainſt that tyranny, ſeeks to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject you, to the furious jealouſie of one; you take offence againſt your humbleſt vaſſall, that hath never ownd a thought, but how he might honor you. Well then ſayd <hi>Minerva,</hi> if I have done you any offence, I hope you now are ſatisfied? And Madam from what ſatisfied? from ſeeing you ſo beautifull within your bed, anſwered <hi>Adraſte,</hi> that indeed were well, if ſo we could be ſatisfied by ſight. Is there a greater ſatisfaction to ſee the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:396:75"/>
party that you love, replied <hi>Minerva.</hi> Not any ſaid <hi>Adraſte,</hi> ſo as we likewiſe may poſſeſſe it too. But otherwiſe the ſight of what wee have not power to enjoy, doth ſerve but to torment us more. And by ſo much as it is deare to us, even by ſo much it breedeth our vexation more, and chiefly when it reſts in the poſſeſſion of an other too, and one that altogether is unworthy of it. They did proceed ſo farre in this diſcourſe, as the whole houſe at laſt were fallen a ſleepe, ſome here, ſome there. <hi>Adraſtes</hi> boy that had atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded below in the Court, ſeeing that it was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſo late, that they were all fallen a ſleepe in the houſe, retired to his Maſters lodging, and left him there; beleeving he would paſſe the night as he did. But <hi>Adraſte,</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> ſlept not, it being ſcarſe long enough to finiſh one part of what they had to ſay. And at laſt, there was not any thing that parted them but day. <hi>Minerva,</hi> being affraid that <hi>Adraſte</hi> might be ſeene to goe out of her houſe, intreated him to go his way, and that hee would ſee her againe before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Sweet light, doth rejoyce the heart of all mankind, and which of all things in the world, art moſt delightfull, and moſt beautifull, how importune, as then wert thou? and much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to theſe happy Lovers heere. And oh ſweet night, offenſive onely, that thou wert too ſhort, permit that I expreſſe the reſt of their kinde lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, each to the other then, by thy own ſilence. And that I never violate the ſacred myſteries, of thy lov'd ſhades. <hi>Adraſte</hi> ſeeing that he needes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:396:75"/>
muſt part, and judging of the paine, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he was to undergo in parting from <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> when as he muſt away unto the Campe, by that he now did feele, in but retiring to his bed. Oh me my greateſt bliſſe, ſayd hee, why ſhould we ever part? what ominous ſtarre, what Spirit of portent, or what curſed ſtate is it, hath power to force me to it? Alas, I doe but hunt, and run in queſt of that falſe honour that deceiveth me, to leave that true and reall glory, that does render me content. Nay Sir, go on, ſayd ſhe, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not part from me, for I ſhall ever follow you, at leaſt in my imaginations, ſince that it is not leſſe within my choice, to live within your ſight. Oh mee my better Genious! ſayd <hi>Adraſte,</hi> then. I here conſigne you ore my life, and doe conjure you there withall, that you doe ſtill remember you of this your promiſe made. Aſſure you ſayd <hi>Minerva,</hi> I ſhall ſooner loſe the memory of my name, then ever of this promiſe made to thee. And that I ſooner will bee drawne to leave my life, then this poſſeſſion thou haſt put me in. I ſweare this by thy ſelfe, that art the onely thing I wiſh to ſweare by under heaven. And adue my deare <hi>Adraſte,</hi> content thee yet with this my full aſſurance given. My goddeſſe, then farwell <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſte</hi> ſayd, in going backe, Once as yet, farwell, And againe once more, farwell. <hi>Adraſte</hi> being parted from <hi>Minerva,</hi> as from his owne Soule, how ever no leſſe contented in her favours, then an other <hi>Iaſon</hi> in his conqueſt, retired to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by the light of the morning, which he could
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:396:76"/>
more willingly have curſed, then ſaluted, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo ſoone brought backe the day: And go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſt at ſuch an houre, as others riſe, and as he had beleev'd he ſhould have roſe himſelfe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being on horſebacke at eight a Clocke, according to his forecaſt, hee found it was almoſt eleven, when he was yet in bed. But he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Minerva</hi> to ſee her at ten, who perceiving the houre paſſed, went to Maſſe, and to meet him, ſhe made choice of the next Church to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> being up, ſayd prayers, and broke his faſt almoſt together, and both in haſte, with a gentleman that had ſtayed for him, even ſince the morne, to go along with him. So ſoone as he had diſpatched ſuch incumbrances, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily doe hinder men upon their leaving ſuch a Citty. At laſt hee got on horſebacke, after one thouſand adues of his friends, and went on paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the Lodging of <hi>Minerva;</hi> there yet, to enjoy one moment of the pleaſure, of which hee now went to deprive him utterly. <hi>Minerva</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commanded at her going out, that they ſhould tell him at what Church ſhee would be, He prayed the company ride on, whilſt he went backe thither, though it were a good way off. But he would have gone much further: <hi>Minerva</hi> being gon on foot for love of him; well might he go on horſebacke for the love of her ſo farre. He found her at the church, juſt as the maſſe was done, when her devotions being finiſhed, ſhee reſted wholy in expectance of him. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pratled ſome while at the Church, hee led
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:396:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her backe to her houſe, there to chat at more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and having withdrawne her againe unto her bedſide, where he ſo happily had paſſed the former night. Good gods, what ſayd they not? Oh Love! how much renowned mightſt thou render mee herein. And I againe might render thee moſt famous to the world, if ſo thou wouldſt inſpire mee now, but with a part of thoſe adues they tooke. <hi>Minerva</hi> heretofore more cruell then a Lyoneſſe, was then become more gentle then a Dove. <hi>Adraſte</hi> holding her between his armes, tranſported with this object of his high felicity, and preſent happines, remembred now no more the great misfortunes he had paſſed. Oh happy condition of a bleſſ'd and perfect Lover, had it not beene diſturbed by the apprehenſion that he had of looſing it. It was paſt two a Clocke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adraſte</hi> could remember him to take his leave, or that <hi>Minerva</hi> thought it time to dine. But <hi>Adraſte</hi> fearing to ſpoile <hi>Minervas</hi> dinner, &amp; <hi>Minerva</hi> being afraid to hinder <hi>Adraſtes</hi> journey, both of them gave way to the neceſſity of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and in the end reſolved them of their laſt farwell. But God knows with what violence their ſoules met in the kiſſes of their lips; and then their hearts feeling the one to approach the other, leaped with ſuch force, as it did ſeeme they would have changed place. <hi>Adraſte</hi> never ceaſing to conjure her love him ſtill, and to write to him oft. Intreated her now to beſtow a favor of him, that hee might beare in this warre, and with the title of her Cavalier, or <hi>Palladin.</hi> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:396:77"/>
was promiſ'd, but not given, becauſe <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> did deſire to have it a ſcarfe of ſuch a faſhion, as would take more time, then ſhe as then had to make it up. The quality of <hi>Paladine</hi> was yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, as we ſhall tearme him in the ſecond part of this hiſtory; which we hope ere long to render you more pleaſant, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke then this Firſt.</p>

What is the matter Madam? have you loſt the name and memory of him that hath not any, but to love you, &amp; to ſerve you; And is it not enough that you are loveleſſe, but you will be too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out memory, without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowledge? How long have I ſighed for you? and you withſtood, not onely my felicity, but more your owne. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, that he that begs love on you now, is he, that of ſo long, hath beene your ſuppliant, and that it is not a vaine humor that invites him to it, but the trueſt paſſion love did ever yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:396:83"/>
Content your ſelfe in that ſo violent reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you have made till now, againſt your own good happe, and ſuffer you your ſelfe to be ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at laſt, by an invincible ſpirit. All things invite you to it, and nothing lets you; your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is protected in my warineſſe, and my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and this ſame innocent feare you have to doe amiſſe, in my favour, is altogether cauſleſſe. God is no enemy of Natures, but its Author, and the offence committed without ſcandalls is no offence; for this'tis ſaid that they are bleſſed whoſe ſinnes are covered.

I cannot deny Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, but your ſorrowes are naturall, ſince they proceed from love, and from the death of a man you lov'd; you have not loved him <hi>ſans</hi> merit, and you have loſt him without poſſeſſing him, ſo as you lament him juſtly. This is a truth, and cannot be denied without offending the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you have for him; But Madam, againſt whom complaine you of his death? Is it againſt God, who did permit him live, or againſt your ſelfe moſt innocent of his death? If it be againſt you, are you not ſtill the more afflicted, and the more ſorrowfull? And if it bee againſt God,

knowes hee not better what is fit for us, then we our ſelves? Could not hee have ſuffer'd him whom you love dead, to have beene living, yet poſſeſſed by another Miſtris, within whoſe arms you had leſſe loved him, then in his grave? Could not hee as well have taken you againe, as him, thereby reducing you to that firſt nothing, which he made you of? Conſider what you complaine of Madam, and you will finde, that it is nought, and that to be moane your ſelfe, and vexe your ſoule for nothing, is an inexcuſable weakneſſe; We well may pardon the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints that griefe inforceth us to utter, for that there is no courage ſo aſſured, whom the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe firſt motions does not overturn; But this ſtorme ceaſed, there is no more excuſe, if Reaſon reaſſumes not place, &amp; at her turn does not obtrude thoſe paſſions, that had turn'd her out. It is for this Men ſay that the ſuperior part of the Soule, ſhould be like the ſupreame Region of the Aire, that never is agitated with, or ſtorm, or tempeſt. See here Madam, the difference twixt what you doe, and what you ought to do, for doubtleſſe, diſcourſe, time, the neceſſity of death, and a thouſand other conſiderations I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſhould before now have ſetled your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have borne a remedileſſe miſhap.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:396:84"/>
and ignorant woman; you ſhut your ſpirits up (which God ordained for heaven) within a grave, together with a dead Carkaſſe, which he it may be hath deprived of life, even for the immeſurable love you bore him, you ſacrifice your Soule to a moſt ſingular griefe, and vainly runne after a ſhadow, you are ſure you never can oretake. Your Soule is the Temple of God, and you adore there, the image of a dead man, whom hee permitted not that you ſhould love, not whileſt he liv'd. You make ſcruple of ſmall thinges, and make no conſcience of Idolatry, which you your ſelf do know to be the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinne that can be perpetrate. The Lawes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a widdow but one yeare, to teſtifie her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſorrowes, which for the moſt part be but in apparance neither, and you reſolve to carry yours eternally within your ſoule. You will nouriſh a Woolfe that devoures you, embrace what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies you, ruine your repoſe, outrage your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and your health, and cauſe your ſelfe to die alive. To conclude Madam, you will openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the will of God, according to which you make profeſſion of ordering yours. Who being our Father, loves us his children, &amp; better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we want, then we our ſelves, rules all things by his Providence, and not according to our fancies. For if the world were governed by the various humors, and divers paſſions of men. Alas! Madam, to what new Chaos were wee then brought backe? And if that ſometimes hee afflict us here, tis alwais yet to profit us, &amp; never to our hurt, and even that ill hee does us, is either
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:396:85"/>
ſtill to make us merit ſome greater good, or elſe to cauſe us ſhun ſome greater ill. Complaine not you unjuſtly then of what he juſtly doth. Think not that he hath ſuffered now this loſſe, for other cauſe then to acquit you of a greater griefe, which howſoever you are unable to perceive, yet ſee you that his power is infinite, and that his judgements are unknown, and which 'tis better farre to apprehend, then prove. But you will tell me the ſame you told me yeſterday, that your paſſions are not ſo eaſily ſhifted as your petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotes. It is true Madame, and I finde it but too certaine in what I undergoe for you. But where are now thoſe ſo ſufficient reaſons, by which you have erewhiles endeavoured to perſwade me, that I might eaſily put off mine? Why ſerve you not your ſelfe againſt your ſelfe, with thoſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons you ſo well handle againſt others? Why doe you thinke it impoſſible to free you of the paſſions you have for a ſhadow, having before beleeved that it was nothing for me to diveſt me of theſe I have for you? Is it that you are more capable of love then I am, or that the ſubject of your love is more excellent then mine? Madame, I will not leſſen the merit of your affections, which you had never conceived, had they not been moſt perfect, of which it is no little proofe to ſee them live yet, in you, after the death of him that cauſed them. Yet are they naturall, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common then to mourne for a loſt friend. But that I had power to humble me ſo, to the pleaſure of a woman, as for her love, I have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:396:85"/>
lov'd even the rivall that hindred me to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is a proofe of an affection Madame, that in ſome ſort exceeds the rule of nature. And in the which you cannot deny, but I ſurpaſſe you, as much as you in all other things exceed me. As to the ſubject of your love, Madame, he was moſt certainly lovely, otherwiſe you had not made choice of him. But without wroning your ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or his merits, I dare ſay, that there was more correſpondence in your humours, then in your qualities; and that more then the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and diſcretion wherewith he entertained you, and whereby chiefly he was praiſe-worthy, he was not poſſeſſed of ſo great perfections, as could make him merit yours. By which you may ſee, that the ſubject of my love being more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then yours, it followes that your paſſions muſt be leſſe then mine, and that you may eaſlier diveſt you of them, then I of mine; yea, if ſo the cauſe remained; which being now no more, it is a marvell that the effect ſhould yet continue. But Madame, I have given ſufficient audience to your plaints, it is now high time that you hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine, if not for my eaſe, yet for your own at leaſt, ſince the moſt miſerable may finde in them ſome cauſe of comfort. You bemoane the dead Madame, and think not of thoſe that die by your meanes. I doe daily periſh, and am evenat the laſt gaſpe, and that for your love: and yet have you the heart to ſigh for another before my face, and the power to interdict my paſſions, to make me wed yours. I ſee a dead body preferr'd to me,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:396:86"/>
which living I in affection yet preceded, and find you as inſenſible and whollie inanimate on my behalfe as he is on yours. My whole labours, all my affections and beſt qualities, are altogether bootleſſe; you know, without acknowledging my faith, you looke upon my afflictions, without once being moved: and whatſoever might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a perfect affection, you behold in me, not daigning ought to regard it. Thou too too much beloved dead man, whoſe condition is moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in compariſon of mine! thou wert living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the moſt lovely beauty under heaven, and thou art onely he that art beloved of her as yet even after death. Thou wert not onely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of thy Miſtreſſe, but thou wert likewiſe of thine enemie. In ſtead of perſecuting thee even to thy grave, as thiefe and robber of my good, which thy remembrance hinders me as yet to have; I have honoured thy memory with my writings, which have ſo imprinted it in the heart of thy Miſtreſſe, as now there is no other impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can take place for that. Is there any comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Is there any paſſion or perfection indeed in love, that can come neere to this? Madame I implore here the beauty of your wit, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of your owne ſoule, in default of mine, that with this thought paſſeth away in tranſe, and leaves me not with other hope or deſire, then here to ſee my life faile me with my ſpeech.</p>

               <p>NOt ſeeing you yeſterday at Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that you have told me, I judged you were retained at home by ſome unhappy diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but I was ignorant of meanes to inform my ſelfe thereof; for to have ſent to you, it was at ſuch an houre as you had not dared to have retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me anſwer, and for to have had me come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you much leſſe: I too, remembred me of what you ſaid, concerning viſits on theſe daies, of which I think full well, and ſhould much better yet, were it a generall rule for all, and not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exception for me onely. But if it were not amiſſe as yeſterday, it is yet good to day, and to morrow better, and I being to depart on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, ſhall conſequently goe without the honour to ſee you, for whom I not onely am and ſtay here, but for whom onely I live, which is not the greateſt of my unhappineſſe, though it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, ſince having alwaies placed your pleaſure
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:396:104"/>
above my owne, I eaſily can reſolve of any thing contenting unto you; but my misfortunes being to me a much leſſe burthen then are yours, it is the greateſt ſorrow <hi>I</hi> can have, to leave you in your enemies hands, from whence it ſeemes you have no will to free your ſelfe, and from whence my minde foregives me, that you will not part, but by the light of ſome debate. Madame, to ſay truth, it is not for me to talke of this: for as it is fatall to me to foretell you verities, it alſo ſeems that you are deſtinate not once to credit them, and that you have no faith nor cares, that you can lend to any one, but ſuch as will deceive you. By ſo much the more as you are good, and generous, by ſo much are you ſubject to deceit, ſince gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity is alwaies oppoſite unto diſtruſt. Who doth no ill, ſuſpecteth none, and one that doth not thinke ere to deceive a friend, beneath the ſhadow of affection, cannot beleeve that in an other, they cannot once conceive in themſelves. But feele you not the effects of ſome deſignes, that you have never ſeene? doe you not ſee, that they have got poſſeſſion of your goods, and of your liberty, and that under a pretence of ſerving you, they doe but tyrannize? But though it be a marvell, I ſhould herein confine me to ſo little ſpeech, having ſuch reaſon to extend me in ſo ſenſible a cauſe, for all this I wiſh not that my paſſion Madame, ſhould yet render me importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but on the contrary <hi>I</hi> moſt humbly crave you will pardon me, if the ſorrow to know you in theſe diſpleaſures, and the feare to ſee you fall
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:396:105"/>
in others yet more great, have made me hazard the diſpleaſing you. It is no part of my deſigne, no rather may I dye then once to think it. You know how much I honour you. I wiſh no other witneſſe of the affection I beare you, then your ſelfe. Beleeve then, it is that which makes me ſpeake, and that I looke upon all other things, <hi>ſans</hi> intereſt. Here then, accuſe me not of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and of phantaſie, upon mine honour there is none, if you call not humour and fancie an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame paſſion to doe you faithfull ſervice, for which there is no deſire of honour, nor neceſſity of buſineſſe, that I'le not quit, nor man upon the earth I would not undertake, and he by ſo much the more heartily then others, as he does under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take concerning you, and does not onely marre the good of your affaires, but more the beauty of your daies, in ſhadow of obliging you. Yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me that I doe take offence at the ill is doneto you. I cannot chuſe but doe it, being ſo intirely yours, as that you have not any thing ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to you as my ſelfe.

You will that I demand your pardon, Madame, hold you to that, I have my knees as plyant, and my heart as humble too, as ere they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but then it muſt be onely in my thoughts, ſince, that your ſight is poſitively ſo denyed me, and that I cannot thinke that the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time you have to afford me your company, can wipe from off my ſoule, the ſorrowes that I feele, for that you have made me looſe. Adue then Madame, amid the ſorrow of ſuch griefes as beare me away, I yet ſhall carry along with me, the contentment never to have increaſed the number of thoſe importunities, which make a rape upon your liberty, nor never to have diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the obedience which I owe you.</p>

               <p>VVHen I met you yeſterday, I thought it had been for my good, but I finde to day it had been for my good, but I finde to day it was but to render me yet more miſerable. I had ſet up my reſt, and as there is more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance to reſolve of an unhappineſſe, then to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it; I had already digeſted therein the worſt of bitterneſſe, for that I was reſolved. But this unhappy encounter hath as it were reburied me in the ills from whence I was almoſt gotten, and have cauſed me to finde them by ſo much the more ſenſible, as they happened to me unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly, and upon the promiſe of a falſe good, that hath cauſed me a thouſand reall evils. What can I have done unto you ſince yeſternight, Madame, who hath obliged you to doe me the diſpleaſures you have cauſed me feele this morning? which I beg'd of you, and you promiſed me as the laſt <hi>I</hi> had to paſſe in this City, <hi>I</hi> did put you in minde of it laſt night, and having roſe this morning by 4 of the clocke, <hi>I</hi> expected newes from you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till 8. At 8 a clock <hi>I</hi> ſent my man to you, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:396:119"/>
a long ſtay returned to tell me that you went unto the Fryars to maſſe: you came not there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till upon eleven: the maſſe laſted till 12. and then <hi>I</hi> perceived you in conduct of another, to hinder me from comming neere you; you that the night before would by no meanes permit me to leade you. Is not this right worthily to acquit you of your promiſe? have you not cauſe to enquire if I be not in better humour then yeſternight, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo well ſatisfied me? but this is not all, to the end <hi>I</hi> take away all cauſe of your accuſing me of fantaſtickneſſe; 'tis fit <hi>I</hi> juſtifie a latter action by another word or two. You know Madame, that <hi>I</hi> have this two moneths intreated you to afford me the audience, cauſed me to come two hundred leagues to obtaine it: for <hi>I</hi> had no other buſineſſe here, and could conveniently have ſtaid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the King, without comming to ſeeke the misfortunes <hi>I</hi> have found, in place of thoſe felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>I</hi> promiſed me, after a thouſand aſſurances, &amp; as many failings, in the end you did vouchſafe it me the laſt time <hi>I</hi> was with you, but in ſuch ſort as it had been better much that you had never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded it, for it was neither to talke to me, nor yet ſo much as once give eare to any thing <hi>I</hi> ſaid, but to render me a ſpectator, at ſuch diſcourſe as then you held with ſome that <hi>I</hi> found with you, and whom you gave command <hi>I</hi> ſhould leave there. Setting aſide, that whileſt your entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was refuſed me, you have afforded it, &amp; doe afford it yet moſt orderly on every day to ſome, without the leaſt divertiſement, and to a man, of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:396:120"/>
whom, obſerve the end which ever crownes the act. Not knowing what more to do or ſay in this, wherin I have done or ſaid as much as can be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; I reſolved to embrace deſpaire, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to goe my waies without once taking my leave, rather then bootleſly lament mee of an ill remedileſſe. You found me yeſterday in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which then you made me leave, to cauſe me take again to day, by this unkinde ill uſe. Your ſervant notwithſtanding comming from you to ſeeke mee, and impoſing your commands not to depart without my bidding you Adue, obligeth me to write unto you. I have told you Madam, heretofore, that I had rather once to fall, then ſtumble ſtill ſo oft; That the time you can afford me now, by no means can repaire what you have made me looſe, and that the long &amp; violent ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes for ſuch a loſſe is far more cruell unto me, then ſuch a ſhort poſſeſſion can poſſibly be ſweet. I am none of thoſe that can crave pardon in their midſt of puniſhment. When we are come ſo far, the worſt is paſt, there is no more but one ſtep then; Nor ſhould I bee in fit eſtate to receive it, would you vouchſafe it, nor doe I now expect it. You have uſed me thus this Twelve month, and if this parting ſhould yet happen like the laſt, why my returne were likely then to prove the ſame. Which is the cauſe that I moſt humbly requeſt your pardon, Madam, if not to intereſt you in my diſgraces, I bear them to ſome other place where you ſhall never be accuſed of them; and if not to importune you with my viſits, and complaints,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:396:120"/>
I write you here this laſt farwell that you ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have of me ſo long as I live. To come home and give it you, to ſpeak with you, and to ſee you; It needs not that I take here the heavens to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for me that I do deſire it, ſince from having too too ardently ſtill coveted it, and from having beene over injuſtly denied it, proceeds all my un happineſſe. But you have too much irritate my ſores, to heale them now, A moment of time wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in interrrupted teares, and unprofitable ſighes, and yeelded at the point of my departure, cannot eface the ſorrowes for the time that you ſo long have ſtill with-held from mee; And then it were indeed, but now to knit, to breake againe to morrow, to beat one round, and endleſſe path, againe and againe to aſcend one rocke. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, then once more thinke of life, after the loſſe of all that ever made mee value it. God knowes the outrage that I doe my ſelfe, and the good whereof I doe deprive me; But I offer my ſelfe no violence that you have not conſtrained mee to, nor deprive mee not of any thing you have not firſt deprived mee: All the ills I can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend you have already cauſ'd mee undergo, and I have yet this comfort in my griefes, that if ſo be there is nothing I can hope, there is alſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I can feare. It is as now almoſt a yeare ſince you did promiſe mee a boone, Alas! with what an infinite of gentle thoughts have I ſtill cheriſht that, without once ſeeing it yet! I render it backe unto you; and I beſeech you gratifie ſome other therwithall, whoſe merits are more known
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:396:121"/>

But I ſhall leave you at leaſt in peace, and never more with my misfortunes will I ever trouble your repoſe.</p>

               <p>I Diſputed long with my ſelfe whether or no I ſhould read your Letter, before I would receive it, And whether I ſhould anſwere it or no when I had read it; And not finding me any waies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged either to the one, or the other, I thought for ſufficient anſwer to have return'd it you, with ſome others that were better in your hands, then in thoſe of a man you have offended.

cauſe mee I ſlight all ſuch as can happen to mee, That is very true that according unto the Lawes, of what is decent, and of humanity likewiſe, if you have any, you ought therein compatiate: But that I can never beleeve that you condole with me an ill, that you your ſelfe doe daily augment, letting me finde ſo many effects contrary to your words, as there can be no day of my life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall not repent me to have beene thereby ſo much ſeduced.

But there is no impoſture ſo manifeſt, to which you rather lend not your beliefe, then to my beſt reaſons, provided that it be againſt me, for that ſufficeth to render it ever juſt. Notwithſtanding you know that I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of ſubjects to cheriſh my vanities with, would I embrance them, and if I were not more diſcreet then your advice can render me, I avow it, that it had been better indeed for me not to have ſpoken ſo worthily of your demerits, or my goodneſſe, but not that the one or the other are imaginary, nor that the modeſt ſilence ſeems to you ſo comely, hath ever been broken yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by you.

But you know me little, having had ſo long experience of me, and have exceeding ill impreſſions of my courage, if ſo you think 'tis

feare that renders me ſo modeſt as I a m. I never feard but you, for that I never loved but you; and and when I ſhall not love you any more, I ſhall then feare you no longer.

I take no knowledge of the report was made to me, and ſo lightly beleeve not what is ſaid of you, as you beleeve whatſoever is ſaid of me; but by that you have ſaid to my ſelfe, I have judged what you might ſay to others.

And indeed, how ſhould I preſerve that I never well acquired? have I not done my utmoſt both in the acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and preſervation? what can I doe more then, after the moſt I was able? I never loved woman equall to her, but it is better not to love at all, then to love ones vexation, and render a man miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the humour of an ingratefull one. She hath at all times ſought me, but it hath been to looſe me: and thoſe pleaſures ſhe hath cauſed me, have been ſo ſhort, ſo thwarted, and ſo imperfect ſtill, that compared with the painefull afflictions ſhe hath procured me, it hath beene a twinkling of faire weather in the inceſſant haile of a perpetuall ſtorme: and one drop of ſweet water amid the boundleſſe extent of a vaſt ſea, brackiſh and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the continuall windes and billowes roaring and rowling on each others necke, in their contentions move an eternall tempeſt, that meets no calme in her embroiles, nor end in the ſtrife of

its perpetuall motions. In a word ſhe's an ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full one, that hath done all that ere ſhe could to torment and offend me. And one that hath not worthily acknowledged my affections, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced them with her outrages. Where is the memory of thoſe indignities and thoſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ſhe hath ſo often done me? Hath ſhe not poorely abandoned me, in favour of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? hath ſhe not taken from me her converſe and company to give it them? Hath ſhe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that they have challenged me three or four times, not once or twice, but I ſay three or four times? And if ſhe ſhall deny the approving of their actions, her own bearing gives her words the lye. For hath ſhe not ſince oppoſed me, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain their quarrell? hath ſhe not preſerv'd their friendſhip with the loſſe of mine? Had ſhe loved her honour, or my life, could ſhe ever have ſeen again the men, conſpired both againſt the one and the other?

Tis true that I was welcom'd, well received, and much made on the firſt day of my arrive; they tould mee that they had grieved my abſence, and deplored my death that a falſe bruit had ſpread, and all, full of other comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and pratles of a woman: but found I not my place poſſeſſed by my <hi>Rivall,</hi> and thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer favours ſhe had permitted me, and <hi>I</hi> againe look'd to have had, cut from my hopes, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother given before my face? Set by thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, the eſcapes, and the repaires, wherewith ſo long ſhe entertained and did abuſe my too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous eaſineſſe; the meetings given out of her houſe, whilſt others ſaw her day by day, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all liberty, but <hi>Emptry</hi> alſo, the irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable enmities, and bloudy quarrels ſhe by her imprudence cauſed me, and her vanity, for yet I would pardon thoſe. But to beſtir her ſo much as ſhe could poſſibly on all ſides, to give unto my enemies the advantages God gave me over them! to ſay my ſword was longer then my Rivals, that he hurt himſelfe, and that my Laquay was a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, when hee recounted the truth of this action, though his wound, and his naturall innocence, in telling of the tale ſpoke ſufficiently for him, and whom ſhe her ſelfe had given me but the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for moſt truſty! To be ſorry that twas ſaid I had the better, and ſhe to ſay gainſt al the world and truth it ſelfe, <hi>I</hi> had the worſt! to forget her ſelfe ſo farre as in oppoſition of my ſelfe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeningly to diſpute a thing, of which ſhe knew
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:396:127"/>
nothing and which <hi>I</hi> my ſelfe had done! Can it be imagined that a woman worſhipped and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with ſo much paſſion and reſpect as ſhe; or rather that the waight of all th'ingratitude of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men kinde melted together, and reduced in maſſe, ſhould ere bring forth the eff<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

In ſumme, ſhe turned me off, not for a ſingle friend, but for ſome five or ſix, nor yet for ſuch as lov'd her more, or thoſe were better made then I, but much, much worſe. She hath beene the cauſe <hi>I</hi> have beene challenged by my friends, that <hi>I</hi> have much neglected my Parents, &amp; eſtate, that I have forborne to follow my King into my owne Country, and ſeemed to ſh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

To love her then as yet, after all this, were but to be a ſot, and no way amorous. Perfidious and moſt thankeleſſe Soule, what wrong hath thy unthankfulneſſe, and thy faith-breach done to thee! what glories have they raviſht from thy memory! <hi>I</hi> had prepar'd thee a place in heaven, where the luſter of thy ſtarre had been adored, ſaluted, and made known to all mortall kinde, where thoſe that live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath another Pole, had worſhip'd thee, even as their chiefeſt conſtellation. Thy image and thy

name had beene ſo venerable to poſterity, that our Nephewes had not filled the earth but with thy Altars, nor had perfumed the ayre but with the odours of thy ſacrifice; The univerſe had beene thy Temple where men had preached, but thy vertues, Celebrated but thy praiſes, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht but thy merits: And thy renowne had been ſo famous ore the world, as it had found no other bounds, then the extreamity of thats extent, and the eternity of its laſting. And though I could yet heape upon thee as much blame, as the honor I prepared for thee, and ſatisfie my ſelfe with as much vengeance as an outraged heart could wiſh, yet will I not afflict thee with a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Then leave thee buried in the abiſſe of thy owne forgetfulneſſe, And not remember mee henceforth of thee, but to deteſt thy memory.</p>
